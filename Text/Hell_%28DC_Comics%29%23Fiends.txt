'''Gehenna''', '''Hades''', '''Hel''', '''Jahannam''', '''Sheol''' and '''Tartarus''') is a [[fiction]]al [[Location (geography)|location]], an infernal Underworld utilized in various [[American comic book]] stories published by [[DC Comics]]. It is the locational [[antithesis]] of the Silver City in [[Heaven in Christianity|Heaven]]. The DC Comics location known as Hell is based heavily on its depiction in [[Abrahamic religions|Abrahamic mythology]]. Although several versions of Hell had briefly appeared before in various other DC Comics publications in the past, the official DC Comics concept of Hell was first properly established when it was mentioned in ''The Saga of the [[Swamp Thing (comic book)#Alan Moore|Swamp Thing]]'' (vol. 2) #25\u201327 (June\u2013August 1984) and was first seen in ''Swamp Thing Annual'' #2 (1985), all of which were written by [[Alan Moore]] and illustrated by [[Stephen R. Bissette|Stephen Bissette]] and [[John Totleben]].\n\nThe [[hierarchy]] of Hell, specifically the triumvirate of  [[Lucifer (DC Comics)|Lucifer]], [[Azazel (DC Comics)|Azazel]], and [[Beelzebub]], was first referred to in ''[[Hellblazer|John Constantine, Hellblazer]]'' #12 (December 1988) (\"The Devil You Know...\" (page 6) by [[Jamie Delano]] and [[Richard Piers Rayner]]) and first appeared in ''[[The Sandman (Vertigo)|The Sandman]]'' (vol. 2) #4 (April 1989) (\"A Hope in Hell\" by [[Neil Gaiman]] and [[Sam Kieth]]); in the story, Lucifer had been forced to accept the position of the ruler of Hell due to the disruption caused by the Great Evil Beast's attack on Creation during the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' in the 16-part storyline \"American Gothic\" in ''Swamp Thing'' (vol. 2) #35\u201350 (April 1985\u2013July 1986). ''John Constantine, Hellblazer,'' would also later add in the [[First of the Fallen]], who preceded Lucifer and his failed rebellion in Heaven. In ''[[Who's Who in the DC Universe#Who's Who in the DC Universe|Who's Who in the DC Universe]]'' #11 (July 1991), the entry on \"Hell's Hierarchy\" included all the elements of Gaiman's version, plus John Constantine the Hellblazer's demonic enemy Nergal, Agony and Ecstasy the Slave-Twins of the Inquisition,<ref>First seen in ''John Constantine, Hellblazer'' #12 (December 1988).</ref> Asteroth,<ref>First seen behind the scenes in ''The Demon'' (vol. 2) #1\u20134 (January\u2013April 1987) and then fully in ''Action Comics Weekly'' #636\u2013641 (the second story in each of the first five issues) (January 24\u2013March 7, 1989).</ref> Abaddon the Destroyer, Morax and [[Superman]]'s demonic enemy Blaze, who, along with her brother Satanus, came to rule Hell in the eight-issue [[Limited series (comics)|miniseries]] ''[[Reign in Hell]]'' (September 2008\u2013April 2009, also including ''DC Universe Special: Reign in Hell'' #1 (August 2008)).\n\n==Publication history==\nBecause of the multiplicity of imprints and acquisitions under the DC Comics umbrella, there have been many different versions of \"Satan\" and \"Hell\".\n\nAt [[Quality Comics]] in 1942, the superhero known as [[Midnight (DC Comics)|Midnight]] encountered the Devil and his domineering Wife after his untimely death.<ref>This incident occurred in ''Smash Comics'' #36 (October 1942).</ref> At [[Fawcett Comics]] in 1942, [[Ibis the Invincible#Prince Amentep|Ibis the Invincible]] I (Prince Amentep) confronted a demonic entity who inexplicably named itself \"Satan\".<ref>This incident occurred in ''Whiz Comics'' #27 (February 1942).</ref> At [[DC Comics]], the pages of ''[[Showcase (comics)|Showcase]]'' #60 (January\u2013February 1966) featured the first appearance of Azmodus and ''[[Justice League of America]]'' #49 (November 1966) introduced the demon Abaddon, who possessed a farmer named Hiram Spiezel. DC Comics' interpretation of [[Lucifer (DC Comics)|Lucifer]] debuted in a dream sequence in ''[[Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen]]'' #65 (December 1962). Lucifer was introduced for real in ''[[DC Special Series]]'' #8 (1978), a.k.a. ''[[The Brave and the Bold]] Special'', which teamed up the [[Batman]] I (Bruce Wayne), [[Sgt. Rock|Sgt. Franklin John \"Frank\" Rock]] and [[Deadman (DC Comics)|Deadman]] and depicted Lucifer being summoned by the ghosts of [[Guy Fawkes]], [[Benedict Arnold]], [[Adolf Hitler]], [[Jack the Ripper]], [[Nero]] and [[Bluebeard]] and controlling a human operative named Edward Dirkes. Jason Blood had a nightmare about Hell in [[Jack Kirby]]'s ''The Demon'' #14 (November 1973), but otherwise, the concept was in absentia other than through [[Retroactive continuity|retcon]]. Etrigan the Demon debuted in the first issue of the 16-issue Jack Kirby series ''The Demon'' (August\u2013September 1972\u2013January 1974), but Hell was never actually mentioned, seen or shown in a concrete manner in any of the original ''Demon'' stories until ''The Saga of the Swamp Thing'' (vol. 2) #25\u201327 (June\u2013August 1984), in which [[Alan Moore]] made the first canonical claim for Etrigan the Demon being a denizen of Hell, referring to his promotion to a Rhyming Demon and having him speak consistently in rhyme, which he did ''not'' do at all during the Kirby series. Many stories in DC's various mystery and horror anthology titles featured \"Satan\" and at least one, in ''[[Weird Mystery Tales]]'' #4 (January\u2013February 1973), featured Lucifer, but these stories may or may not be in mainstream DC Universe continuity at all. Satan did appear, along with an angelic pre-Fall Etrigan the Demon, in one of the four possible origins of the Phantom Stranger (three of which are [[Judeo-Christianity|Judeo-Christian]] inspired, the fourth, [[science fiction]] inspired) in ''[[Secret Origins]]'' (vol. 2) #10 (January 1987).\n\nAside from the above-mentioned stories, Hell made its actual first appearance in ''Swamp Thing Annual'' #2 (1985). Subsequently, it would appear again in ''Swamp Thing'' (vol. 2) #49\u201350 (June\u2013July 1986), in which there is a civil war going on in Hell and Etrigan the Demon is there. The [[Spectre (DC Comics character)|Spectre]]'s ([[Jim Corrigan#Jim Corrigan (1940s)|James Brendan \"Jim\" Corrigan]] I) failure in his intervention in this conflict leads to a reduction of his powers, as described in ''The Spectre'' (vol. 2) #1 (April 1987). While Hell appeared in the 31 issues (and one ''Annual'' (1988)) of that series (April 1987\u2013November 1989), readers never saw any major developments outside of characters being condemned to go there and the occasional demon or demons tormenting them, such as in ''The Spectre'' (vol. 2) #21 (December 1988). Hell also appeared in the 31 issues (and one ''Annual'' (1985)) of ''[[Blue Devil (DC Comics)|Blue Devil]]'' (June 1984\u2013December 1986; also including a special insert in the center of ''The Fury of [[Firestorm (character)|Firestorm]] the Nuclear Man'' #24 (June 1984), which started the series). In ''[[The Sandman (Vertigo)|The Sandman]]'' (vol. 2) #4 (April 1989), the rulers of Hell are introduced, a triumvirate consisting of Lucifer, a fallen angel deliberately drawn to resemble [[David Bowie]], Azazel, a shadowy, many-eyed former [[Jinn|djinn]] (\"genie\") (Azazel had previously appeared as an [[incubus]] in a Madame Xanadu story that was first published in ''[[Cancelled Comic Cavalcade]]'' #1 (summer 1978) and then was officially published in ''[[The Unexpected (1968 comic book)|The Unexpected]]'' #190 (March\u2013April 1978)) and Beelzebub, a high-ranking demon resembling a large [[fly]]. This triumvirate (albeit with Beelzebub referred to as Belial; possibly a continuity error) returned in ''[[Secret Origins]]'' (vol. 2) #48 (April 1990), presenting the never-before-told origin of [[Stanley and His Monster|Stanley and his Monster]], in which Lucifer banishes a minor demon from Hell to Earth for being \"too nice\" for Hell, where he is discovered by Stanley Dover Junior, who names him Spot. This version of Hell is also depicted in the 58 issues (plus two ''Annual''s (1992 and 1993) and one #0 issue (October 1994)) of ''The Demon'' (vol. 3) (July 1980\u2013May 1995), the four-issue miniseries ''[[The Books of Magic]]'' (December 1990\u2013March 1991) and the three-issue miniseries ''[[Kid Eternity#Modern incarnation|Kid Eternity]]'' (vol. 2) (May\u2013October 1991) by [[Grant Morrison]] and [[Duncan Fegredo]].\n\nIn ''Swamp Thing Annual'' #2, Hell was said to be a place that mortal beings went to only because they truly '''''believed''''' that they belonged there. During the fourth ''Sandman'' story arc, ''[[The Sandman: Season of Mists|Season of Mists]]'', in ''The Sandman'' (vol. 2) #21\u201328 (January\u2013July 1991), Lucifer decides to abdicate the throne of Hell and forces all of these beings to leave. He closes the gates of Hell behind him, locks them and gives the key to [[Dream (comics)|Dream]] of the [[Endless (comics)|Endless]], who does not want it, and many divine beings, such as [[List of The Sandman characters#Odin|Odin]], [[List of The Sandman characters#Bast|Bast]] and [[Lords of Chaos and Order#Members|Shivering Jemmy of the Shallow Brigade]], a [[Lords of Chaos and Order|Lord of Chaos]], attempt to persuade him to give the key to them. Odin attempts to bribe Dream with the Twilight Dimension of [[Ragnarok]] from ''Last Days of the [[Justice Society of America]] Special'' #1 (1986), specifically because it contains his successor's grandfather, [[Hawkman (Carter Hall)|Hawkman]] I (Carter Hall (a.k.a. Prince Khufu Kha-Tarr)) and his prot\u00e9g\u00e9, the [[Sandman (Wesley Dodds)|Sandman]] I (Wesley Bernard \"Wes\" Dodds),<ref>This incident occurred in ''The Sandman'' (vol. 2) #26 (May 1991)</ref> but this attempt fails, as do ''all'' of the others. Eventually, Dream gives the key to the angels [[List of The Sandman characters#Remiel|Remiel]] and [[Duma (DC Comics)|Duma]], who, having been denied re-entry into the Silver City, reinstate Hell as a place of spiritual rehabilitation rather than eternal punishment. This version of Hell is also depicted in the four-issue miniseries ''Stanley and His Monster'' (vol. 2) (February\u2013May 1993), ''Vertigo Visions: Phantom Stranger'' #1 (October 1993), a [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]] issue under the Vertigo imprint by [[Alisa Kwitney]] and [[Guy Davis (comics)|Guy Davis]], the 16-issue series ''[[Kid Eternity#Modern incarnation|Kid Eternity]]'' (vol. 3) (May 1993\u2013September 1994) by [[Ann Nocenti]] and [[Sean Phillips]], also under the Vertigo imprint (albeit with Beelzebub having taken human form) and ''[[Batman]]'' #544\u2013546 (July\u2013September 1997), which guest-starred Etrigan the Demon.\n\n''John Constantine, Hellblazer'' under [[Garth Ennis]] would have its own Satan and, to avoid clashes with ''The Sandman'' (vol. 2), this version was turned in ''John Constantine, Hellblazer'' #59 (November 1992) into the First of the Fallen: the first being in Hell, preceding Lucifer and his failed rebellion in Heaven. The First and two other demons ruled Hell once Lucifer had abdicated the throne, with the two demons said to be only barely in charge, and in a [[fourth wall]] moment the First complained about \"those endless, bloody triumvirates\". {{issue|date=July 2019|reason: what Vertigo issue does this quote come from?

The Human Defense Corps were able to defeat a minor Lord of the Damned named Scarmaglione, then Sergeant Montgomery Kelly of the Corps killed him, assumed his powers and claimed his clan for the [[United States|United States of America]].

DC Comics' Hell is a debased reflection of Earth, meaning that as Earth became more technologically or socially advanced so did Hell, due to an effect not unlike [[time dilation]]: \"[a] day in Hell is equal to a minute's passage on Earth\". All denizens of the mainstream DC Comics version of Hell are capable of using some form of [[Maleficium (sorcery)|maleficium]]; the most powerful infernal magic users are the ruling gentry of Hell and their enforcers the Necro-Mages, Forges, Exegesis Guild, Renderers, Howlers, Incendiaries, Rhyming Demons and Wishweavers. Every building, weapon, piece of furniture, piece of armor, article of clothing, serving of food, etc. in Hell is made from the bodies of the damned. The damned are put through a process called rendering by the Exegesis Guild and their servants the Renderers in order to manufacture the raw materials of Hell.<ref name=\"Hell' 2008\">''Reign in Hell'' #1 (September 2008)</ref>\n\n===Fictional history===\n====''Underworld Unleashed''====\n{{main|Underworld Unleashed}}\nDuring the ''Underworld Unleashed'' crossover event, Neron appeared in the mainstream DC Universe for the first time and established himself as the ruler of Hell, a position that he held for many years.\n\nHe then devised an elaborate scheme to conquer Earth and to gain a \"pure soul\" that he could corrupt, which ultimately involved many of the DC Universe's [[supervillain]]s and a number of the DC Universe's [[superhero]]es. Neron offered both groups numerous deals in order to give them their greatest desires in exchange for their souls or for completing a task for him. The scheme was ultimately defeated by the combined efforts of both [[Justice League International#Expansion|Justice League America]] and the [[Trickster (comics)#Fictional character biography|Trickster]] I (Giovanni Giuseppe a.k.a. James Montgomery Jesse).\n\n====''The Final Night''====\n{{main|The Final Night}}\nDuring ''The Final Night'' crossover storyline, the Rhyming Demon known as Etrigan the Demon offered to bring all of the living people of Earth into Hell so that they could stay warm in exchange for their souls; the people rejected his offer, primarily because his plan was to shift Earth into Hell.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dcuguide.com/FN/FN_003.php |title=Final Night #3 |access-date=2009-03-29 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120905081217/http://www.dcuguide.com/FN/FN_003.php |archive-date=2012-09-05}}</ref>\n\n====''Day of Judgment''====\n{{main|Day of Judgment (comics)}}\nDuring the ''Day of Judgment'' crossover storyline, a renegade King-Angel of the Bull Host named [[Asmodel]], with the help of Etrigan the Demon (who was trying to cause chaos on Earth and defeat his enemy, Neron), briefly took control of the then-hostless Spectre-Force using the ashes of an angel's wing feather and sought to destroy both Heaven and Hell. He used the Spectre's powers to extinguish the hellfire font, causing Hell to freeze over. A team of superheroes, including Superman, Zatanna Zatara, [[Sebastian Faust]], [[Firestorm (comics)#Fire Elemental|Firestorm the Nuclear Man]] II (Ronald Roy \"Ronnie\" Raymond), the [[Atom (Ray Palmer)|Atom]] II (Raymond \"Ray\" Palmer), the [[Enchantress (DC Comics)#Day of Judgement|Enchantress]] and [[Deadman (DC Comics)|Deadman]], were sent deep into Hell's depths in order to reignite the hellfire font. The reignition required an act of true evil, so Sebastian Faust took matters into his own hands and killed the Enchantress by slitting her throat, thereby damning himself to Hell and thus satisfying the infernal conditions.\n\nThe crossover storyline ended with a three-way battle between Neron, Asmodel and the then-deceased [[Hal Jordan|Harold \"Hal\" Jordan]] (the former [[Green Lantern]] II) for control over the Spectre-Force (which ultimately chose Hal Jordan, thus making ''him'' the Spectre for a time).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dcuguide.com/DoJ/DoJ.php |title=The Unofficial Day of Judgment Index |access-date=2009-03-29 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120903163136/http://www.dcuguide.com/DoJ/DoJ.php |archive-date=2012-09-03}}</ref>\n\n====''Reign in Hell''====\n{{main|Reign in Hell}}\nDuring the events of the ''Reign in Hell'' miniseries, Hell is thrown into a massive conflict as Neron and his generals are confronted with a rebellion led by Blaze and Satanus, the rulers of Purgatory. Neron soon discovered that the rebel demons were offering the damned \"hope to the hopeless\" and redemption for them, which had ''never'' happened before, and that this was a powerful spur. Realizing what would happen if the damned ever rose up against him, Neron has his consort Lilith, the \"mother of all Earthborn fiends\", summon all of the [[vampire]]s,  [[Werewolf|werewolves]], [[ghoul]]s and infernally powered humans to Hell to fight on his side.\n\nThis unrest in the infernal realms attracts the attention of Earth's magical superheroes, who are concerned about the outcome and the possible repercussions of the war. Many of them descend into Hell and take sides in the conflict (all for reasons of their own), including [[Zatara#Death|Giovanni \"John\" Zatara]],<ref>Zatara was the only one of the magical superheroes involved in this story who was already dead and his soul damned to Hell (where he was part of a general resistance movement that was operating there at the time).

All of the rulers of the Provinces bowed down to Neron, then to Satanus when he took the throne of Hell from Neron and then to Blaze when she did the same thing to Satanus. The Nine Provinces included Pandemonia, the Odium, the Gull, Praetori, Internecia, Ament, the Labyrinth, Err and Purgatory (''below, there are descriptions of the Nine Provinces of the Infernal Dominion as depicted in the miniseries'').<ref name=\"Hell' 2009\"/>\n\n*'''Pandemonia''' - The First Province, home of Hell's high-caste demons and the location of the throne of Hell, the seat of the Dominus or Domina.\n*'''The Odium''' - The Second Province, the industrial and [[manufacturing]] center. It is home of the rendering factories, the Exegesis Guild and the Renderers.\n*'''The Gull''' - The Third Province, the [[Trade|mercantile]] and [[commerce]] center.\n*'''Praetori''' - The Fourth Province, the [[Administration (government)|administrative]] and [[government]]al ministries.\n*'''Internecia''' - The Fifth Province, the [[military]] and [[enforcement]] ministries.\n*'''Ament''' - The Sixth Province, the cultural [[propaganda]] ministry.\n*'''The Labyrinth''' - The Seventh Province, the judicial detainment ministry and Hell's only prison.\n*'''Err''' - The Eighth Province, the theological suppression ministry.\n*'''Purgatory''' - The Ninth Province, the place of secondary damnation; it was formerly ruled by Blaze and Satanus. Anyone can leave Purgatory and enter Hell, but they can never leave Hell once they have arrived there.\n*'''The Selvage''' - The [[Selvage]] is the infernal [[Aether (classical element)|aether]], a dimensional waste which separates and surrounds the Provinces; all passage between the Provinces must pass through the Selvage. The very nature of the Selvage is such that it rejects magic.\n*'''Masak Mavdil''' - The lowest place in Hell; the pit of rejected failures where demons exile their own kind and which is guarded by the Archfiend Abaddon the Destroyer.\n\n==The Infernal Hosts==\nAccording to the ''Reign in Hell'' miniseries, Blaze, the sister of Satanus, is the current ruler of Hell; she succeeded her brother who, in turn, succeeded Neron. The mainstream DC Comics version of Hell always has a single ruler known as the \"First Seated of the Entire Infernal Dominion\" and holding the title of either [[Dominus (title)|Dominus]] (male) or [[Dominus (title)|Domina]] (female); the first such Dominus was Neron, the current Domina is Blaze, sister of Satanus and daughter of the wizard [[Shazam (wizard)|Shazam]] and a demoness (name unknown).\n\nThe First Seated rules by his (or her) \"infernal will and chthonic way\"; he (or she) is addressed as the '' \"Lord\" '' (or \"Lady\") \"of the Hosts of Hell, First Seated of the Entire Infernal Dominion\".\n\n===The First Seated of the Entire Infernal Dominion===\n*'''[[Blaze and Satanus|Blaze]]''' - The former co-ruler of Purgatory; the current Domina, the First Seated of the Entire Infernal Dominion and the hybrid daughter of the wizard Shazam and a demoness (name unknown).<ref>First seen in ''Action Comics'' #655 (July 1990).</ref>\n*'''[[Blaze and Satanus|Satanus]]''' - The former co-ruler of Purgatory; the former Dominus, the First Seated of the Entire Infernal Dominion and the hybrid son of the wizard Shazam and a demoness (name unknown).<ref>First seen in ''The Adventures of Superman'' #493 (August 1992).</ref>\n*'''[[Neron (DC Comics)|Neron]]''' - Neron is also known as the \"King of Hate\" and the \"Lord of Lies\".
