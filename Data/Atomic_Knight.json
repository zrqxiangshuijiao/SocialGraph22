Hercules, [[Kamandi]], and the Atomic Knights all inhabited the same comics universe, one in which the [[Great Disaster]] had taken place (references to 1986 became less and less frequent as that date actually approached). ''Crisis on Infinite Earths: Absolute Edition'' had ''two'' Great Disaster realities: Earth-86 (where the Great Disaster was an atomic war) and Earth-295 (where the Great Disaster was natural). Since the Great Disaster on Earth-295 was natural that reality had no Atomic Knights.\n\nThe entire Great Disaster concept has since been declared to be out-of-continuity in the current DC Universe, although one of the Post-52 alternate Earths (Earth-17) ''does'' feature the world of the Great Disaster. ''[[DC Comics Presents]]'' #57 attempted to [[retcon]] the Atomic Knights by 'revealing' them to be the dream of Gardner Grayle in a state of suspended animation (during which dream Superman attempts to prevent Grayle from causing a nuclear war). This story is not held to be canon in terms of the Earth of the Great Disaster, and little reference has been made to it after publication.\n\nThe 15 Atomic Knights stories were reprinted in ''Strange Adventures'' #217-231. In 2010 they were collected into a single DC [[hardcover]] volume; their appearances in ''Hercules Unbound'' and ''DC Comics Presents'' had not been reprinted until a 2014 volume entitled ''Showcase Presents The Great Disaster Featuring the Atomic Knights''.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n===Gardner Grayle===\n{{Superherobox\n|image=Atomicknight.png\n|image_size=175\n|caption=Atomic Knight '''Gardner Grayle'''.\n|real_name=Gardner Grayle\n|publisher=[[DC Comics]]\n|debut=''Strange Adventures'' #117 (June 1960)\n|creators=[[John Broome (writer)|John Broome]]<br>[[Murphy Anderson]]\n|alliances=Atomic Knights<br>[[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]]<br>[[Forgotten Heroes]]<br>[[Seven Soldiers of Victory]]\n|aliases=[[Shining Knight]]\n|powers=Precognition<br>Wears a suit of armor granting enhanced strength, speed, endurance and blasts of energy, as well as being adaptable to other technology\n}}\nOn Earth-One, '''Gardner Grayle''' was a [[sergeant]] in the army. His platoon was the infamous Platoon 13 and its symbol was a knight. Feverishly opposed to nuclear war, Grayle volunteered for a virtual reality experiment to see how people would react to a post-atomic war world. Within this experiment, Grayle believed that the adventures of the Atomic Knights were only a dream. After emerging from the experiment, Grayle donned a [[S.T.A.R. Labs]] battle suit and declared himself a modern knight in shining armor, briefly becoming the second [[Shining Knight]] and serving with the [[Seven Soldiers of Victory]].<ref name=\"dc-ency\"/>\n\nAfter a mildly successful career as a superhero, Grayle took a job at S.T.A.R. When he received a premonition from the goddess Cassandra, Grayle proceeded to use his new technical know-how to build his atomic armor. He then participated in the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' as one of the [[Forgotten Heroes]] who contacted [[Darkseid]] to enlist his help against the [[Anti-Monitor]].\n\nAfterward, he appeared in the ''[[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]]'' (vol. 1), a team he joined and stayed with until its disbanding. The Outsiders would later reform (in vol. 2) but were considered fugitives after being framed for the slaughter of a Markovian village (home country to Outsider [[Geo-Force]]). At first, he hunted the team down but was ultimately convinced of their innocence and was able to clear their name to the rest of the world. He also helps the Outsiders battle a vampiric infestation of the underground nation of Abyssia. With the Outsiders, he also fell in love with fellow Outsider Windfall and they were seen together at Geo-Force's wedding.\n\nBeyond just his Atomic Knight armor, Gardner also had the power to see the future.\n\n[[Image:NewAtomicKnights.JPG|left|thumb|200px|The Atomic Knights from ''Battle for Bludhaven'' #6, art by [[Dan Jurgens]] and [[Jim Palmiotti]].]]\nIn the post-''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' mini-series ''The Battle for Bl\u00fcdhaven'' that takes place [[One Year Later]], Gardner Grayle is the leader of an underground band of new Atomic Knights operating within the destroyed city of [[Bl\u00fcdhaven]], working with an organization named the Roundtable towards helping citizens harassed by the organization known as [[Father Time (DC Comics)|S.H.A.D.E.]] and the new Black Baron (a former pimp and drug dealer who gains metahuman powers after the Bl\u00fcdhaven destruction and is later defeated by the [[golem]] known as [[Monolith (comics)|Monolith]]). There are roughly 125 Atomic Knights, with the main Knights being Grayle, Marene and Doug Herald, Bryndon, and Wayne and Hollis Hobard (based on the original group from the 1960s), who are shown posing as refugees with the help of advanced cloaking technology, and using armor with numerous powers including the ability to record and analyze complex data and fire powerful ballistic and nuclear blasts. At the end of the series, [[Captain Atom]] obliterates the remains of Bl\u00fcdhaven, making way for the departure of S.H.A.D.E. operatives. After this, the Knights are seen entering an underground lush environment through a bunker named '''Command-D''', reminiscent of their access to the post-nuclear world of their original incarnation. Command-D is the bunker in which Kamandi and his grandfather, the original [[OMAC (comics)|OMAC]], lived.<ref name=\"dc-ency\"/>\n\nIn the second issue of ''[[Final Crisis]]'', Dan Turpin travels to Bl\u00fcdhaven and briefly sees the Atomic Knights, riding atop giant dogs in the ruined city. Afterwards, he visits the Command-D bunker.\n\nIn the third issue, the Knights accompany [[Wonder Woman]] into the city, where they go up against an evil [[Mary Marvel]] who has had her body augmented by their technology, who chops Marene Herald in half.\n\nIn the fourth issue, the Atomic Knights among those in the Bl\u00fcdhaven Strike Force are eventually killed in battle, when Darkseid's forces showed their hand at Bl\u00fcdhaven.\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nGardner Grayle has precognition.\n\n===Equipment===\nGardner Grayle wears a suit of armor that grants him enhanced strength, speed, endurance and blasts of energy, as well as being adaptable to other technology.\n\n==Other versions==\nIn the out-of-continuity maxi-series ''[[Justice (DC Comics)|Justice]]'', the [[Atom (Ray Palmer)|Atom]] wears a suit of armor that resembles the Earth-One Atomic Knight.\n\n[[Image:Earth17.JPG|right|thumb|225px|Atomic Knights from ''52'' Week 52, artist Justiniano.]]\nIn ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'', the existence of a new Multiverse is revealed.

In the episode \"The Book of Markovia: Chapter One: Blessings and Curses Reborn\", Major Sara Grey tasks Grayle and fellow operative Specialist Travis with bringing [[Lightning (DC Comics)|Jennifer Pierce]] to high-ranking agent Odell. However, Grayle allows her to escape after incapacitating Travis. In the episode \"The Book of Markovia: Chapter Two: Lynn's Addiction\", Grayle pre-records a message for anyone to find if anything happens to him before helping Lynn sneak [[Tobias Whale]] out of the Pit before they are attacked by a [[Markovia]]n operative and teleported to Markovia by the teleporting mercenary Instant. In the episode \"The Book of Markovia: Chapter Three: Motherless Id\", Grayle contacts Black Lightning about what happened to Lynn and arranges a parley with Major Grey for a temporary truce to handle the matter. In the episode \"The Book of Markovia: Chapter Four: Grab the Strap\", Grayle assists Black Lightning and his allies in recusing Lynn from the Markovians. Along the way, he stops [[Geo-Force|Brandon Marshall]] from killing Dr. [[Helga Jace]] and evacuated them. In the season three finale \"The Book of War: Chapter Three: Liberation\", Grayle assisted in evacuating metahumans out of the Pit, only to be stopped by Gravedigger.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090303183426/http://www.dcuguide.com/who.php?name=AtomicKnight DCU Guide entry]\n* [http://www.toonopedia.com/atomic_k.htm The Atomic Knights] at [[Don Markstein's Toonopedia]].
