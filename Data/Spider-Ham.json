The series, published bi-monthly, lasted seventeen issues before its cancellation in 1987. With the cancellation of ''Peter Porker, the Spectacular Spider-Ham'', the character became a backup feature in ''Marvel Tales'', a monthly reprint series showcasing Spider-Man's past adventures. Beginning with issue #201 ([[cover date]]d July 1987), these new Spider-Ham stories appeared in issues #201\u2013212, 214\u2013219, 223\u2013230, 233, 236, 237, 239, 240, and 247 before ceasing altogether.\n\nIn issue #3 of ''[[What The--?!]]'' (cover dated October 1988), Porker meets with Raven the Hunter (a parody of Spider-Man's nemesis [[Kraven the Hunter]]) in a story that satirized the popular \"[[Kraven's Last Hunt]]\" storyline which had been featured a year earlier in Marvel's Spider-Man titles. Spider-Ham also makes appearances in issues #18, 20, 22, and 24 of ''What The--?!'' The 26th issue of ''What The--?!'' (cover dated fall 1993) features \"Spider-Ham 15.88\", a humorous take-off on Peter Parker's future counterpart, Miguel O'Hara a.k.a. ''[[Spider-Man 2099]]''. The \"15.88\" is not seen as a year, but rather a humorous take on the price of a ham (the cover states that it was marked down from the original price of $20.99).\n\nSpider-Ham has also appeared on the cover of ''[[Wha...Huh?]]'' #1, and was referred to as a fictional character in the [[Earth-616]] Marvel Universe, in ''[[Generation X (comics)|Generation X]]'' #52.\n\n''Spider-Man Family'' #1 (2005 one-shot) features a sixteen-page ''[[Spider-Girl (Mayday Parker)|Spider-Girl]]'' story, in which May Parker ([[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]]'s daughter) watches a [[DVD]] showing a small portion of a fictional Spider-Ham animated series, discovering that it was created by one of Spider-Man's enemies, [[Jack O'Lantern (Marvel Comics)|Jack O'Lantern]]. Here, Spider-Ham appears to mostly be a parody of [[Batman]]. Also in the issue, there is a partial reprint of ''Marvel Tails'' #1.\n\nSpider-Ham was selected by fans and retailers to be the focus of the final variant cover by Mike Wieringo to the ''[[Spider-Man: The Other]]'' crossover, ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #528.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.newsarama.com/forums/showthread.php?threadid=53776 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20081211063549/http://www.newsarama.com/forums/showthread.php?threadid=53776 |url-status= dead |archive-date= 2008-12-11 |title= [Updated] CHECKING OUT THE SPIDER-HAM | work = Newsarama |via= Web.archive.org |date=2008-12-11 |access-date=2019-06-30}}</ref>\n\nIn January 2007, [[J. Michael Straczynski]] authored the ''[[Ultimate Marvel|Ultimate]] [[Civil War (comic book)|Civil War]] Spider-Ham'' [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]], featuring Spider-Ham's attempt to find his missing \"thought balloons\" against a Civil War parody. The story does not fit in with previously established Spider-Ham continuity.\n\nTom Defalco returned to Spider-Ham's world in 2009, in the pages of ''Amazing Spider-Man Family'' #4\u20135. He introduces Swiney-Girl, the daughter of Spider-Ham and counterpart of Defalco's other creation [[Spider-Girl (Mayday Parker)|Spider-Girl]]. Once again, the story strays away from the established, albeit loose, continuity of the original Spider-Ham stories by altering the character's origin and supporting characters, most notably in establishing Peter Porker as a natural-born [[pig]] bitten by a radioactive spider (directly mirroring Spider-Man's origin) and altering his love interest (a counterpart of [[Mary Jane Watson]]) from a [[water buffalo]] to a [[crane (bird)|crane]].\n\nHe fights alongside the ''X-Babies'' in issue #4 (March 2010) of their four-issue miniseries from 2009\u20132010.\n\nTo mark the anniversary of ''Peter Porker, The Spectacular Spider-Ham'' #1, Marvel released the ''Spider-Ham 25th Anniversary Special'' in July 2010, with Tom Defalco writing both Spider-Ham and Swiney-Girl stories. These stories feature most of Spider-Ham's original cast and origin, but incorporates the Mary Crane Watsow character from ''Amazing Spider-Man Family'' rather than her original counterpart.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nPeter Porker was born a spider (simply named Peter). He resided in the basement lab of May Porker, a slightly goofy animal scientist who had created \"the world's first atomic powered hairdryer\", hoping that \"the introduction of nuclear fusion into America's beauty salons\" would \"revolutionize the hair care industry\".<ref name=\"Time\"/> After dousing her head with water and activating the dryer, May Porker accidentally irradiated herself, and in a fit of delusion, bit Peter, who then found himself transformed into an anthropomorphic swine much like May Porker herself. Running from the Porker homestead disoriented, Peter soon came to realize that he still retained a spider's abilities:\n\n<blockquote>''\"This is astounding! Am I a spider with the limitations of a pig? Or a pig with the proportionate strength and agility of a spider? I've become something greater than either spider or pig... I've become a '''Spider-Ham!'''\"'' \u2013 ''Peter Porker, the Spectacular Spider-Ham'' #15 (May 1987)</blockquote>\n\nAfter this startling series of events, Peter (who adopted the surname \"Porker\", that of his benefactor May Porker, who after the accident mentally attuned to a state in which she believed she was Peter's loving aunt) dedicated himself and his new-found abilities to fighting injustice and the occasional animal parody of established Marvel Comics villains. May Porker's scientific genius was transferred to Peter, giving him the know-how to devise his webspinner gauntlets to replace his lost natural ability.\n\n===Misadventures===\nPorker, in his spider-themed alter-ego's first adventure, teamed up with Captain Americat, as they attempted to foil the nefarious plot of The Marauder, in a series of events that led to the creation of the Hulk-Bunny (''Marvel Tails'' #1, \"If He Should Punch Me\").\n\nSeveral months later, Spider-Ham encountered his main nemesis and one of his only recurring enemies in the form of Ducktor Doom, a duck parody of Doctor Doom (''Peter Porker, the Spectacular Spider-Ham'' #1, \"The Mysterious Island of Ducktor Doom\"). Spider-Ham would meet again with Doom when Porker would foil the would-be world conqueror's plot to create an army of living super vegetables (''Peter Porker, the Spectacular Spider-Ham'' #6, \"Salad Daze\").\n\nOther notable menaces Porker would face along the way include the Bull-Frog (a parody of the Marvel villain [[Man-Bull]]), the Buzzard (an opossum take on the Spider-Man adversary the [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Vulture]]), Hogzilla (a swine counterpart to the more popular [[Godzilla]]), and the King-Pig (seemingly the swine equivalent of Marvel's mob-boss the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]]).\n\nThree characters, not parallels to anybody in the Spider-Man series, also begin in #1: J. Jeremiah Jackal, Jr. (J. Jonah Jackal's nephew), Bunson Bunny and Upton Adam Stray (a cat with shades), all junior trainees at the Daily Beagle. They acquire super-powers in #15, encouraging Spider-Ham in his already made decision to abandon his super-hero career, but they fumble their first mission, forcing Peter Porker to resume his alter-ego as Spider-Ham. Further misadventures of the Beagle Brigadeers were presented within the back-up stories in ''Marvel Tales''.\n\nThe series also included back-up stories featuring such characters as Deerdevil ([[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]), Goose Rider ([[Ghost Rider]]) and the Fantastic Fur (the [[Fantastic Four]]).\n\n===Marvel Zombies===\nWhen Spider-Ham accidentally travels to the ''[[Marvel Zombies]]'' universe, he is suddenly zombified by a group of zombies, namely [[Captain America]], [[Hulk]], and [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]]. It appears that he is directly shot in the head by an energy bullet by [[Ultron|Earth 616's Ultron]], effectively killing him but, in a zombie state, Spider-Ham turned into [[Hannibal Lecter|Ham-ibal Lecter.]]\n\n===Spider-Verse===\nDuring the ''[[Spider-Verse]]'' storyline which featured Spider-Men from various alternate realities, Spider-Ham became a member of the Spider-Army fighting against the Inheritors. He played a crucial role in the final confrontation when he switches places with Benjy Parker (the baby brother of [[Spider-Girl (Mayday Parker)|Spider-Girl]] of [[Marvel Comics 2|Earth-982]]) \u2013 one of the three sacrifices needed for the Inheritors to destroy the Spider-Totems \u2013 allowing [[Uncle Ben#Spider-Verse|Ben Parker]] to get Benjy to safety.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 3 #14</ref>\n\n===''Secret Wars''===\nDuring the ''[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]'' event when all universes were destroyed and their remains formed a single planet called Battleworld, Spider-Ham found himself the only pig in the domain of the [[Battleworld]] called Arachnia and ended up as the captive of its [[Mayor]], [[Norman Osborn]]. He was rescued by [[Spider-Gwen]],<ref>''Secret Wars: Spider-Verse'' #1 (May 2015)</ref> and the two eventually discovered and teamed up with other spider-powered people ([[Spider-Man Noir]], [[Spider-Man: India]], [[Captain Britain Corps|Spider-UK]] and [[Anya Corazon]]), neither of whom remembered their previous encounter during the original ''Spider-Verse''.<ref>''Spider-Verse'' vol. 2 #2 (Jun. 2015)</ref>\n\n===''Web Warriors''===\nFollowing the conclusion of ''Secret Wars'', the team of six Spiders that formed during the event feature in a new ongoing series called ''Web Warriors'', a name that was coined by the Peter Parker of the [[Ultimate Spider-Man (TV series)|''Ultimate Spider-Man'' TV series]] during the original ''Spider-Verse''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bleedingcool.com/2015/06/29/spider-gwen-stars-in-web-warriors-launched-by-mike-costa-and-david-baldeon-marveloctober/|title=Spider-Gwen Stars In Web Warriors Launched By Mike Costa And David Baldeon #MarvelOctober (UPDATE)|website=www.bleedingcool.com|date=29 June 2015|access-date=22 December 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Other characters==\nEarth-8311 features [[talking animals in fiction|talking animal]] parody versions of a variety of other Marvel characters including some superheroes and supervillains.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

He used his powers for good and even joined his world's [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], but [[J. Jonah Jameson|J. Jonah Jackal]] turned the public against him and forced him to quit. In the episode \"The Spider-Verse\" Pt. 2, Porker encounters the \"prime\" Spider-Man while relaxing on his farm. With his encouragement, Porker decides to become Spider-Ham once again and help him fight the [[Norman Osborn|Green Goblin]].

He arrives in [[Miles Morales]]' universe along with [[Spider-Man Noir]] and [[Peni Parker]] due to the [[Kingpin (character)|Kingpin]]'s machinations before teaming up with them, Morales, Peter B. Parker, and [[Spider-Woman (Gwen Stacy)|Spider-Woman]] to get back to their respective home universes; using his unique skill set to fight off the Kingpin's henchmen along the way. Before returning home to his own universe, he leaves his cartoon mallet with Morales as a keepsake.\n** Spider-Ham appears in the prequel short ''[[Spider-Ham: Caught in a Ham|Caught in a Ham]]'', with Mulaney reprising his role. He battles and defeats Doctor Crawdaddy (voiced by Aaron LaPlante) in his typical cartoonish fashion until an interdimensional portal appears and affects him and his surroundings in a manner similar to the ''Looney Tunes'' short ''[[Duck Amuck]]'' before whisking him away, leading into his appearance in the film.\n** Mulaney also expressed interest in a potential film starring Spider-Ham, describing its plot as a [[Watergate]]-like story along the lines of ''[[The Post (film)|The Post]]'' or ''[[All the President's Men (film)|All the President's Men]]'' while focusing on the character's career as a reporter.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Donnelly |first1=Matt |title=John Mulaney's Pitch for 'Spider-Ham' Film: ''Spotlight''\u2026 but Family Friendly' |url=https://variety.com/2018/film/news/spiderham-spiderman-john-mulaney-1203092130/ |access-date=March 14, 2020 |work=Variety |date=December 18, 2018 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Long |first1=Christian |title=John Mulaney has a pitch for a Spider-Ham solo film |url=https://www.comingsoon.net/movies/news/1020497-john-mulaney-has-a-pitch-for-spider-ham-solo-film |access-date=March 14, 2020 |work=ComingSoon.net |date=December 19, 2018}}</ref>\n* Mulaney returned to voice Spider-Ham in the animated short film ''Back on the Air'', which was created to promote the character's appearance in the video game ''Marvel Contest of Champions'' (see below).<ref name=\"The Gamer\">{{cite web |last=Kobek|first=Patrick|date=December 2, 2020|url=https://www.thegamer.com/spider-ham-spider-man-marvel-contest-of-champions-john-mulaney/|title=Spider-Ham Swings Into Marvel Contest Of Champions With Animated Short|publisher=TheGamer|access-date=December 3, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"Superherohype\">{{cite web |last=Abbate|first=Jake|date=November 30, 2020|url=https://www.superherohype.com/video-games/489923-marvel-contest-of-champions-brings-back-john-mulaney-as-spider-ham|title=Marvel Contest of Champions Brings Back John Mulaney As Spider-Ham|publisher=Superherohype|access-date=December 2, 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Video games===\n* Spider-Ham makes a cameo appearance in a mid-credits scene depicted in ''[[Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions]]'', voiced by an uncredited, former Activision Associate Producer [[Kevin Umbricht]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D9hJEbQCPY |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211221/-D9hJEbQCPY |archive-date=2021-12-21 |url-status=live|title=Spider-Ham's First Voice Actor & More!
