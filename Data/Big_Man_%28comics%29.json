He took over the role to gain revenge for the death of his father and sister, which, owing to [[J. Jonah Jameson]]'s then-hostile attitude towards Spider-Man, he blamed on the webslinger. Using one of [[Arcade (Marvel Comics)|Arcade]]'s Murderworlds, Foswell Jr. attacked them with [[Mac Gargan|Scorpion]], [[Life Model Decoy]]s of [[Human Fly (comics)|Human Fly]], and replicas of the [[Spider-Slayers]].
