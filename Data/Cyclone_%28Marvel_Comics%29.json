Formerly a French [[engineer]] working for [[NATO]], Gerard had a falling out with his former employees, supposedly related to political decisions over implementing his research, based on the development of a weapon that generates high velocity tornado-like winds. Cyclone took his invention and used it for his own criminal ends, developing his costume and other weapons. Like many criminal masterminds in [[Spider-Man]] comics, he decided to form a gang and capture [[J. Jonah Jameson]], the owner of the [[Daily Bugle]], and like so many criminal masterminds who follow this plan, he was defeated by Spider-Man.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #143. Marvel Comics.</ref> He also kidnapped [[Robbie Robertson (comics)|Joseph \"Robbie\" Robertson]], but was again defeated by Spider-Man.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #144. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nHe was subsequently broken out of prison by the [[Masked Marauder]] and employed by the Nefaria Family of the [[Maggia (comics)#The Nefaria Family|Maggia]] as an enforcer. Cyclone was sent to kill Spider-Man and [[Moon Knight]], but was defeated by Moon Knight.<ref>''Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man'' #22-23. Marvel Comics.</ref> He was doing relatively well for himself, in spite of his defeats at the hands of Spider-Man. Concerned over the deaths of various costumed villains by the vigilante Scourge organization, Cyclone attended a meeting at the \"Bar with No Name\" in Medinah County, [[Ohio]], to deal with the Scourge and was shot to death by a [[Scourge of the Underworld|Scourge]] agent posing as the bartender.<ref>{{cite comic|writer = [[Mark Gruenwald]]|penciller = [[Paul Neary]]|inker = [[Dennis Janke]]|story = Overkill|title = [[Captain America]]|volume = 1|issue = #319|date = July 1986|publisher = Marvel Comics}}</ref>\n\nGerard's DNA was later used by [[Arnim Zola]] to create a proto-husk.

It was killed by Captain Marvel (who was actually a Skrull sleeper agent) with its remains decimated in one powerful attack.<ref>''Captain Marvel'' vol. 7 #1.

Not wishing to serve the European crime family any longer, he stole the suit and fled. Now freelance, he operated as an agent of Justin Hammer, before being recruited into [[Crimson Cowl (Justine Hammer)|Justine Hammer]]'s first incarnation of the [[Masters of Evil]].<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #18. Marvel Comics.</ref><ref name=autogenerated1/> As a part of the Masters of Evil, Cyclone battled against the Thunderbolts and other assorted heroes.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #18-25.

Marvel Comics.</ref> After it was revealed that Justin Hammer had planted time bombs in his former agents, Cyclone was given the option to work with the Thunderbolts to rid themselves of the threat. At first, Fresson attempted to flee, but quickly surrendered and joined the Thunderbolts. Running into Silver Sable like his predecessor, Fresson would assist the Thunderbolts in freeing Justin Hammer's former agents of their biological time bomb.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #65-67. Marvel Comics.</ref> He was also with the Thunderbolts when they attacked the omnipotent [[Thanos]] after Thanos had received the power of the Heart of the Infinite. Cyclone would battle against the Elite Agents of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] before [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Hawkeye]] would give him the option of either remaining a Thunderbolt or being cut loose. Choosing the latter, Cyclone was dropped with an electrical arrow and turned over to S.H.I.E.L.D. as he was no longer a Thunderbolt and therefore a felon.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #71-73.

He was able to use these whirlwinds to fly and could use them offensively against opponents. His costume was later passed on to the second Cyclone and later recreated for the third Cyclone.\n\n==In other media==\nA member of the [[Elementals (Marvel Comics)|Elementals]] modeled after Cyclone appears in the live-action [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] film ''[[Spider-Man: Far From Home]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2476052/how-kevin-feige-and-jon-watts-feel-about-potentially-bringing-green-goblin-and-doc-ock-back-to-the-spider-man-movies|title=How Kevin Feige And Jon Watts Feel About Potentially Bringing Green Goblin And Doc Ock Back To The Spider-Man Movies|date=2019-07-04|website=CINEMABLEND|access-date=2019-07-05}}</ref> Identified as the Air Elemental, it was said to have power over wind and storms.
