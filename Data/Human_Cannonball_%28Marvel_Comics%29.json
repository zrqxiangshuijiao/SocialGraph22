He is a member of the criminal organization, the [[Circus of Crime]], and works as a human cannonball and acrobat who specializes in being shot out of a cannon. He wears a costume and helmet that protects him from injury. He initially wears a red crash helmet and purple jumpsuit. In a battle with the [[Hulk]], he has himself shot out of his cannon at the Green Goliath with no other weapon but a replica of Thor's hammer. The Hulk punches him right up through the top of the circus tent. This stunt, and subsequent dialogue, makes it pretty clear that Jack is not all that smart.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' #3 (Sept. 1962)</ref>\n\nWhen the Circus of Crime next appears, Jack has changed his outfit. His costume is now orange and he has replaced the crash helmet with a metal bullet-shaped hat so he can use his head as a battering ram. It doesn't help him. [[Spider-Man]] and [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]] ride him through the air like a bucking bronco and steer him into a crash with a group of circus rubes.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #16 (Sept. 1964)</ref>\n\nFrustrated by this defeat, Cannonball is more than willing to throw in with the [[Clown (comics)|Clown]], [[Princess Python]] and [[Great Gambonnos]]. They kick the Ringmaster out and become the Masters of Menace, a name Princess Python thinks up, led by the Clown. With the Great Gambannos he robs some paintings as he is used to batter through a door and knocks out Jameson using his helmet, placing him in hospital. When Spider-Man attacks the Masters at their hideout, the web-slinger \"wonks\" Cannonball on the top of his bullet hat, crumpling it and knocking it down over his eyes.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #22 (March 1965)</ref> He rejoins the Ringmaster when he fails to lure [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Hawkeye]], [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] and the [[Scarlet Witch]] into the group. Quicksilver easily defeats him.<ref>''The Avengers'' #21-22 (Oct.-Nov. 1965)</ref>\n\nCannonball and the Circus later battle a series of heroes including [[Luke Cage]],<ref>''Power Man'' #25 (June 1975)</ref> [[Namor]],<ref name=autogenerated1>''Super-Villain Team-Up'' #8-9 (Oct.-Nov. 1976)</ref> and the [[Shroud (comics)|Shroud]],<ref name=autogenerated1/> the Hulk,<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #217 (Nov. 1977)</ref> [[Howard the Duck]],<ref>''Howard the Duck'' #25-27 (June-Sept. 1978)</ref> [[Power Pack]],<ref>''Power Pack'' #59 (Oct. 1990)</ref> [[Generation X (comics)|Generation X]],<ref>''Generation X'' #32 (Nov. 1997)</ref> Spider-Man,<ref name=autogenerated2>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' Annual 1998</ref> and [[Devil Dinosaur]] and [[Moon-Boy]].<ref name=autogenerated2/>\n\nHuman Cannonball later appeared as a member of [[Hood (comics)|Hood]]'s crime syndicate.<ref>''Dark Reign: The Hood'' #1 (July 2009)</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nThe Human Cannonball wears padded steel armor to protect his head, shoulders, wrists and feet from the effects of his attack. The armor also offers some protection from physical attacks. He usually uses a trailer mounted [[Pneumatic weapon|air cannon]] to fire himself at opponents or onto buildings. He sometimes carries a [[mace (bludgeon)|mace]] to hit opponents as he flies by them.\n\n==In other media==\n===Television===\n* Human Cannonball appears in \"The Incredible Hulk\" portion of ''[[The Marvel Super Heroes]]''.\n* Human Cannonball appears in the ''[[Spider-Man (1981 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'' episode \"Carnival of Crime\".\n* Human Cannonball appears in the ''[[Avengers Assemble (TV series)|Avengers Assemble]]'' episode \"Crime and Circuses\", voiced by [[Bumper Robinson]].\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://marvel.wikia.com/wiki/Jack_Pulver_(Earth-616) Human Cannonball] at Marvel Wiki\n* [https://comicvine.gamespot.com/human-cannonball/4005-10858/ Human Cannonball] at Comic Vine\n\n{{Stan Lee}}\n{{Jack Kirby}}\n\n[[Category:Characters created by Jack Kirby]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Stan Lee]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1962]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from Los Angeles County, California]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]"}]}}}}
