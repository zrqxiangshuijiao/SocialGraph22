The original version of the character was created by writer [[Gardner Fox]] and artist Howard Sherman, debuting in ''[[More Fun Comics]]'' #55 (May 1940). The character has appeared in various incarnations, with Doctor Fate being the name of several different individuals in the [[DC Universe]] as part of a [[Magician (fantasy)|sorcerous]] [[Legacy hero|legacy]] with several attempts to revitalize the character.<ref name=\":6\" /><ref name=\":03\"/><ref name=\"newsarama1\" />\n\nIn the [[DC Universe]] continuity, Doctor Fate was originally conceived as a force fighting against the supernatural being [[Nabu (comics)|'''Nabu''']], a cosmic being affiliated with the Lords of Order, [[Mesopotamian deities]],<ref>Note: Throughout the character's history, despite being referenced in Mesopotamia as early as ''1st Issue Special'' #9, he is erroneously stated to be Egyptian.</ref> and a chief enemy of his cosmic opposites, the Lords of Chaos. Over time, Nabu instead empowered mortal agents to act on his behalf and the Lords of Order, the first being [[Doctor Fate (Kent Nelson)|'''Kent Nelson''']], the Strauss family, and various others. Other versions of the character differ, acting as solely supernatural-based heroes, affiliated with the [[Lords of Chaos and Order|Lords of Chaos]], or [[Demonology|demon hunters]]. Several years after the [[The New 52|New 52]] reboot, DC Comics introduced its latest and second-longest-running incarnation, '''[[Doctor Fate (Khalid Nassour)|Khalid Nassour]]''', the grandnephew of Kent Nelson chosen by [[ancient Egyptian deities]] and [[archangel]]s.\n\nThe Doctor Fate character has appeared in various incarnations across multiple forms of media based on both comic and original characters; The Kent Nelson incarnation has appeared in several media, such as the television series ''[[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville]]'', in which he is portrayed by [[Brent Stait]], and the [[DC Extended Universe]] film ''[[Black Adam (film)|Black Adam]]'', in which he was portrayed by [[Pierce Brosnan]]. In animated media, several incarnations of Doctor Fate have appeared in the [[Young Justice (TV series)|''Young Justice'']] animated series; Nabu, Khalid Nassour and Kent Nelson's versions of Doctor Fate have appeared in the animated series alongside other original incarnations based on pre-existing characters such as [[Zatara]], [[Zatanna]], and [[Traci 13]].\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Publication history==\n\n=== Golden Age ===\nThe first character to debut as Doctor Fate was Kent Nelson, who appeared in his own self-titled six page strip in ''[[More Fun Comics]]'' #55 (May 1940) during the [[Golden Age of Comic Books]].

The series ran for 67 issues and three annuals, concluding in 1987. Doctor Fate made occasional modern-day appearances in ''[[Infinity, Inc.]]'' in 1984, the same year which witnessed the 22nd and final annual Justice Society/Justice League team-up.<ref>''Justice League'' #231-232 (October\u2013November 1984). DC Comics.</ref> Doctor Fate also made a guest appearance in a 3-issue 1985 crossover in the pages of ''Infinity, Inc.'' #19-20 and ''Justice League'' #244. Doctor Fate then appeared in the four-part special ''America vs. the Justice Society'' (1985) which finalized the story of the Justice Society, featuring an elaboration of the events of ''Adventure Comics'' #466 and a recap of the Justice Society's annual team-ups with the Justice League. In 1985, DC collected the Doctor Fate back-up stories from ''The Flash'', a retelling of Doctor Fate's origin by [[Paul Levitz]], [[Joe Staton]], and [[Michael Netzer|Michael Nasser]] originally published in ''Secret Origins of Super-Heroes'' (January 1978) (''DC Special Series'' #10 in the indicia), the Pasko/Simonson Doctor Fate story from ''1st Issue Special'' #9, and a Doctor Fate tale from ''More Fun Comics'' #56 (June 1940), in a three-issue [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] titled ''The Immortal Doctor Fate''.

The series ended with issue #41.<ref>''Doctor Fate'' (vol. 2) #41 (June 1992).

Unlike prior depictions, the character is instead no longer rooted in Egyptian/Mesopotamian mythology and is disassociated with the Lords of Chaos and Order due to being killed off during Infinite Crisis. Gerber also stated his intentions of not directly contradicting previous runs while raising the subject as little as possible.

Known often as the primary and most well-known incarnation of the character, Nelson serves as both the main character and major supporting character to several of the ''Doctor Fate'' titles over the years. \n\nBorn as the son of an archaeologist, Kent was an American of both Swedish and British descent who ventured with his father into a tomb in Mesopotamia, discovering the human body of Nabu but at the cost of his father's life. Nabu would pity the child and train him in the ways of magic before making him Doctor Fate, an agent of the Lords of Order. Kent would begin a superhero career specializing in magic and was a founding member of the All-Star Squadron and Justice Society of America as well as bonded with his partner and eventual wife, Inza Cramer. Later revisions to his history altered his relationship with Nabu, portraying him as a overbearing, controlling figure that manipulated a young Kent Nelson into being his agent while slowly supplanting his free will with his own.<ref name=\":2\" /> In modern continuity, he is succeeded officially by his grand-nephew and apprentice, Khalid Nassour.\n\nAltered by Nabu, Kent possesses a level of immortality, invulnerability, and telekinetic abilities on his own.

He would have a bond with his future partner, Linda Strauss, whom became his step-mother after Rebecca committed suicide on account of the abuse she received from Henry. Soon, Linda herself was subjected to abuse at his hands but endured it for Eric, whom she found herself having a strange fascination with.
