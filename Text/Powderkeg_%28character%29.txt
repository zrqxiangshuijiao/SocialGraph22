Bright]].\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nLittle is known about the man who became Powderkeg. He was a mercenary hired to steal high-tech circuitry for Brazilian crime lord [[Kristina Ramos]]. He ran afoul of Captain Marvel II ([[Monica Rambeau]]) who had thought she lost her powers after stopping a mutated [[Marrina]]. She encounters Powderkeg and used her new powers to defeat him.<ref>''Captain Marvel Special'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nPowderkeg fights the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] during a failed mass prison escape occurring at the [[Vault (Marvel Comics)|Vault]] (\"Venom Deathrap: The Vault\"). During the incident, he follows the leader of the breakout, Venom. Teamed with [[Mentallo]] and [[Vermin (comics)|Vermin]], they temporarily defeat [[Iron Man]] and [[Hank Pym]]. The entire breakout is soon neutralized by technological means, with energy pumped through Mentallo.<ref>''Avengers: Deathtrap, The Vault'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nPowderkeg is later recruited by [[Doctor Octopus]] to join his incarnation of the [[Masters of Evil]] during the ''[[The Infinity War|Infinity War]]''. The Masters of Evil confront the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (1969 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]] in the [[Avengers Mansion]]. Everyone becomes embroiled in a fight against evil doubles of both teams. Magus, the villain behind the Infinity War, had recruited an army of super-powered doubles to defeat and absorb Earth's superpowered resistance.<ref>''Guardians of the Galaxy'' #28. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nBoth groups work together to survive the assault. The doubles only stop apperearing with other forces stop the Magus. Doctor Octopus wants to continue his assault on the Mansion and on the Guardians. Powderkeg and his other allies are displeased with this, unwilling to turn on those who they had literally fought back to back with just minutes ago. The Masters turn on Octopus, pursuing him out of the Mansion.<ref>''Guardians of the Galaxy'' #29. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nAt some point, Powderkeg is finally captured and imprisoned, where he would later team up with a number of other villains against the [[She-Hulk]], although they are defeated.<ref>''She-Hulk'' #5-6. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nHe's appeared in ''[[Spider-Man: Brand New Day|Brand New Day]]'' as one of the patrons of the [[Bar With No Name]].<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #562-563. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nAt some point in time between then and the fall of Norman Osborn, he was captured and sent to The Raft, where, during a visit by the [[Avengers Academy]], there was a power failure caused by Hazmat (on the team), allowing the prisoners to run riot. Powderkeg almost crushes Hazmat and [[Mettle (comics)|Mettle]], but the timely intervention of Tigra saved them. He is put back in his cell in the end.<ref>''Avengers Academy'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nPowderkeg is superhumanly strong and highly resistant to injury. Further, he sweats a nitroglycerin-like compound which can detonate on impact, lending explosive force to his punches.\n\n==In other media==\nPowderkeg receives a brief mention in the non-fiction book ''From Krakow To Krypton''. His fight with the [[Yancy Street Gang]] and [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] of the [[Fantastic Four]] is discussed.<ref>{{cite book |title= Krakow to Krypton: Jews and comic books|last= Kaplan|first= Arie|year= 2008|publisher= Jewish Publication Society|isbn= 978-0-8276-0843-6|page=97 }}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Frank_Skorina_(Earth-616) Powderkeg] at Marvel Wiki\n* [http://comicvine.gamespot.com/powderkeg/4005-6824/ Powderkeg] at Comic Vine\n\n{{Avengers characters}}\n\n[[Category:Characters created by Dwayne McDuffie]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1989]]\n[[Category:Fictional mercenaries in comics]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters with superhuman strength]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]"}]}}}}
