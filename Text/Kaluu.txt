He and the [[Ancient One]] became fellow students of the mystic arts.\n\n[[Varnae]], the eldest of the true [[Vampire (Marvel Comics)|vampires]], met with Kaluu and imparted to him knowledge from the primeval compendium of black magic known as the [[Darkhold]]. Subsequently, Kaluu set about to make himself ruler of Kamar-Taj.  While the Ancient One continued his studies, Kaluu used his sorcery to influence the minds of the people of Kamar-Taj.  Eventually, Kaluu and the Ancient One together cast a spell that eliminated disease, poverty, and suffering from Kamar-Taj and granted its people immortality. Shortly thereafter, the people of Kamar-Taj, responding to Kaluu's magical influence on their minds, crowned him as their king. For over a year Kaluu organized the men of Kamar-Taj into an army of conquest. Meanwhile, Kaluu slowly increased his mystic control over the minds of the people of Kamar-Taj so that they become little more than his placid puppets. The Ancient One attempted to warn the people of Kamar-Taj about Kaluu, but Kaluu's magic prevented them from heeding him. Kaluu struck the Ancient One with a magical bolt from behind which paralyzed him. Then Kaluu had his soldiers conquer a neighboring village and reduce it to slavery.\n\nUsing black magic to control the people of [[Kamar-Taj]], he waged war against the Ancient One, but he summoned a pestilence that almost wiped out the entire population of Kamar-Taj and forced Kaluu to flee to the dimension of [[Raggador]].<ref>{{Cite comic |writer = [[Bill Everett]] |cowriters = [[Denny O'Neil]] |penciller = Bill Everett |story = The Origin of the Ancient One! |title = [[Strange Tales]] |issue = #148 |date = Sept. 1966 |publisher = Marvel Comics}}</ref> He emerged from Raggador five centuries later and attempted to steal the [[Book of the Vishanti]].

When he returned from exile he became a businessman and amassed a large fortune. He formed an alliance with the embattled Doctor Strange, and tutored him in the practice of black magic. Alongside Strange, he battled [[Shuma-Gorath]] and various other ancient evils.<ref>''Strange Tales'' vol. 3 #8-10</ref> He also witnessed Doctor Strange's defeat of Shuma-Gorath. Kaluu, Strange, [[Rintrah (comics)|Rintrah]], and [[Enitharmon the Weaver]], returned to the Earth dimension where he cast a spell to remove the physical and astral pollution from Strange caused by using black magic.<ref>''Strange Tales'' vol. 3 #14-17</ref>\n\nKaluu plans to live a quiet, enjoyable life, while living off money he made by influencing the stock market.\n\nHe is seen communicating via [[crystal ball]] with the new [[Ronin (Marvel Comics)|Ronin]] (who was actually [[Blade (comics)|Blade]] posing as the \"Spider Hero\").<ref>''The Mighty Avengers'' vol. 2 #4</ref>\n\nKaluu later appears as a member of the [[The Mighty Avengers|Mighty Avengers]].<ref>''Captain America and the Mighty Avengers'' #1</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nKaluu has the ability to manipulate magical forces for a vast number of effects, including levitation, teleportation, energy projection, conjuration of small physical objects, physical transformation of objects, and the tapping of extra-dimensional energy by invoking entities or objects of power existing in dimensions tangential to Earth's through the recitation of spells. He has used this skill to render himself immortal. He also has the powers of mesmerism, thought-casting, illusion-casting, and astral projection.\n\nAccording to the back story of the character, Kaluu is possibly the most powerful living human black magician. Kaluu's magic derives not only from personal, universal and dimensional powers: he has powers gained through the tapping of the life forces of living beings and the manipulation of the environment in certain ways that have destructive side effects.\n\nKaluu has used mystical means to render himself immortal. He does not age, but he can be killed by external means.\n\nKaluu is a master of various Asian martial arts, but prefers not to engage in physical combat. He has extensively studied sorcery and possesses vast knowledge of black magical lore.\n\nKaluu formerly wore an eye-patch covering his left eye, though this eye has since been restored.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://marvel.wikia.com/Kaluu_%28Earth-616%29 Kaluu] at Marvel Wiki\n* [http://www.comicvine.com/kaluu/4005-28991/ Kaluu] at Comic Vine\n\n{{Doctor Strange}}\n{{Marvel Mystic}}\n{{Stan Lee}}\n[[Category:Avengers (comics) characters]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Bill Everett]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Dennis O'Neil]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Stan Lee]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1966]]\n[[Category:Fictional Tibetan people]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters who use magic]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics martial artists]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]"}]}}}}
