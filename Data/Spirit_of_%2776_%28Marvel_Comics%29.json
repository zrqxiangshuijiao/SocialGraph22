In a [[Canon (fiction)|canonical]] portion of a story in issue #4 (Aug. 1977) of the [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|alternative universe]] series ''[[What If (comics)|What If?]]'', Naslund succeeds Steve Rogers as [[Captain America]], the first of three official replacements until Rogers resumed the role years later. This [[retcon]] became necessary after Marvel's conflicting accounts of Captain America in 1950s and 1960s comics had created a discrepancy.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nWilliam Naslund was born in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]]. An athletic young man, hoping to help the Allies' World War II efforts in a unique way, he develops exceptional fighting skills and learns to copy some of the moves Captain America employed with the discus-like shield that he carried. He is recruited by a mysterious man called \"Alfie\" to become a costumed hero in the new team of adventurers called the [[Crusaders (Marvel Comics)|Crusaders]], alongside [[Dyna-Mite]], [[Ghost Girl (Marvel Comics)|Ghost Girl]], Thunderfist, [[Captain Wings]], and Tommy Lightning. The team eventually learns that Alfie is a German agent, but not before he has manipulated them into fighting the Allied super-team the [[Invaders (comics)|Invaders]]. Upon learning how they had been duped, all the Crusaders but Naslund left costumed adventuring.<ref>''The Invaders'' #14\u201315 (Mar\u2013April 1977)</ref>\n\nWhen the original Captain America, Steve Rogers, and his sidekick, [[Bucky Barnes|Bucky]], went [[missing in action]] in 1945, U.S. President [[Harry S. Truman]] recruited Naslund and a young man named [[Bucky (Marvel Comics)|Fred Davis]] to become the new Captain America and Bucky.<ref>''What If'' #4 (August 1977)</ref> Alongside [[Namor]] the Sub-Mariner and the original [[Red Guardian#Aleksey Lebedev|Red Guardian]], the new Captain America stopped a Nazi plot to destroy the Potsdam Conference.<ref>''Namor, the Sub-Mariner Annual'' #1 (1991)</ref> They briefly fought alongside the post-war [[All-Winners Squad]], battling [[Isbisa]]<ref>''All-Winners Comics'' #19 (Fall 1946)</ref> and, with the [[Blonde Phantom]], fought to prevent a criminal attempt to steal the atomic bomb, encountering a time-traveling [[She-Hulk]] during this mission.<ref>''The Sensational She-Hulk'' #22 (December 1990)</ref> Naslund was killed in 1946 in the line of duty when he was crushed to death by a robot serving the [[android (robot)|android]] named [[Adam II]] while warning the rest of the All-Winners Squad of Adam II's attempt to kidnap or kill then-Congressional candidate [[John F. Kennedy]] in Boston.
