The Frost home was not one of love and kindness, but one of manipulation and control. Adrienne established herself as the \"perfect child\" and was the favorite of their father, hoping to gain his favor and inherit the Frost family fortune.\n\nAdrienne was a power monger and showed little remorse or emotion when hurting her siblings both emotionally and physically. At an early age, Adrienne discovered her [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] ability of [[Psychometry (paranormal)|psychometry]]: the ability to touch an object and instantly know the object's history in terms of events surrounding its past, present, and future owners.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web |last=Staff |first=C.

Instead, he planned to pick the child whom he perceived as being able to guide his company into a state of growth and prosperity.\n\nThis simply reinforced her original beliefs and she became cold and distant from the world, the only people who were worth anything were those she could manipulate in her chess game of power. Her power allowed her to become an 'A' student and excel in all her endeavors, continuing to earn her father's favor. However, Emma's rebellion against their father leads to Winston developing a profound new interest in her.

Confident, Adrienne gathered with her siblings for her father to reveal who would guide his finances into the next millennium.  Believing herself to be the prime candidate, Adrienne was shocked when their father chose Emma as his heir. However, sick of her father's manipulations, Emma chose to leave and make it on her own, leaving Adrienne as the second choice.\n\nAdrienne continued living under her father, at times even suffering his physical abuse. She continued to resent Emma and their father, going so far as to release to the media a ransom video of Emma that had been sent to their father. Winston, having disowned Emma, wished to ignore the video, but was placed in the public eye by Adrienne's actions.\n\nAfter this, it is unknown what happened to her parents. Adrienne assumed control of Frost Enterprises, using her powers to increase her wealth and power. She eventually married but frequently clashed with her husband, Steven. Adrienne killed him by surprise, using a katana because he had crossed her in some way.<ref>''Generation X'' #54</ref>\n\n===Headmistress of Generation X and Revenge===\nEmma approached Adrienne seeking to borrow money after her Massachusetts Academy had fallen into debt. Initially turning Emma down because of their history, Adrienne accepted her offer after using her powers to learn that the academy was secretly the home of Generation X.<ref>''Generation X'' #49</ref> She became co-headmistress of the Massachusetts Academy and convinced her sister to re-open the school to the public to raise the funds necessary to keep the school open.<ref>''Generation X'' #49-50</ref> As a result of the new human student body, Generation-X was forced to wear uniforms that hid their identities. She also gave Generation X new and sometimes questionable assignments, intentionally putting them in harm's way.<ref>''Generation X'' #51</ref> The first of these assignments was to retrieve from [[Madripoor]], the katana that she had used to kill her husband. Her real intentions for accepting Emma's offer then surfaced. Using a combination of her powers and the [[Danger Room]], she trapped Generation X in a simulation recreating Emma's earlier students [[Hellions (Marvel Comics)|The Hellions']] demise at the hands of [[Trevor Fitzroy]].<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #281</ref> She had hoped to drive Emma insane by watching another group of her students die. While Emma and Generation X were able to escape this illusion, Adrienne, now calling herself the new White Queen, escaped by using a teleportation device concealed as a necklace around her neck.<ref>''Generation X'' #56</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Witiw |first=John |date=2022-08-10 |title=10 Worst Sisters In Comics |url=https://www.cbr.com/worst-sisters-comics/ |access-date=2022-10-11 |website=CBR |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nAdrienne went to London where she successfully embezzled millions from the London branch of the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]].<ref>''Generation X'' #55-56</ref> She then began to plot her revenge on Emma by returning to the school, demanding that she be reinstated as headmistress or she would expose the school as a mutant sanctuary.
