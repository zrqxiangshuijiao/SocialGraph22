The character is usually depicted as an adversary to the superhero, [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]], and less frequently to the [[Punisher]] and [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]].\n\n==Publication history==\n{{expand-section|date=August 2016}}\nCreated by [[Ann Nocenti]] and [[Rick Leonardi]], the character made his first appearance in ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]'' #248 (Nov. 1987).\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nCarl Burbank was a [[priest]] who abandoned his vows following the drug-related deaths of young parishioners. He joined the [[C.I.A.]], which outfitted him with a cybernetic arm and made him an assassin under the codename \"Bushwacker\", but ultimately he became a freelancer.\n\nAt some point, an event took place that compelled Bushwacker to begin a war against all [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutants]]. Bushwacker began hunting and assassinating mutants, most often those mutants whose abilities Bushwacker perceived as making them especially talented in \"the arts\". Bushwacker also claimed that he was paid large sums of money to kill mutants, but this has yet to be verified. [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] learned of Bushwacker's activities and began to hunt the killer. At the same time, Bushwacker's wife Marilyn believed her husband was insane and needed to be placed in a hospital. She sought aid from lawyer Matt Murdock (secretly the hero Daredevil). Bushwacker was tracked down and defeated by the two heroes, which left the right side of his face horribly scarred, and he was placed in police custody.<ref>''Daredevil'' #249 (Dec. 1987)</ref>\n\nLater, Bushwacker joined with [[Typhoid Mary (comics)|Typhoid Mary]] and other enemies of Daredevil in a plan to kill their common foe. After the completion of the plan, Bushwacker was left to his own activities.<ref>''Daredevil'' #259-260 (Oct.\u2013Nov. 1988)</ref>\n\nEntering the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]]'s employ, Burbank attacked the Punisher, but was left for dead. It was during this time that his wife finally left him.<ref>''The Punisher War Journal'' #12-13 (Dec. 1989\u2013Jan. 1990)</ref> He reappeared in the employ of drug lord Nick Lambert, who hired Bushwacker to kill reporter [[Ben Urich]], who was about to run a story of his illegal activities. Instead, when Bushwacker learned the truth, he allowed Urich to live and to complete the expos\u00e9. However, the drug lord managed to bribe himself out of jail. Bushwacker then killed him.<ref>''Daredevil'' Annual #5 (1989)</ref> Bushwacker was later freed by [[Deathlok#Michael Collins|Deathlok]] from captivity by Mechadoom, a rogue [[Doombot]] variant.<ref>''Deathlok'' vol. 2 #5 (Nov. 1991)</ref>\n\nSubsequent activities brought him into conflict with Daredevil, [[Nomad (comics)|Nomad]], the Punisher, [[Boomerang (comics)|Boomerang]], and [[Elektra (comics)|Elektra]]. His clash with Nomad was over the life of a baby that Nomad had taken under his care whom Bushwacker believed to be the daughter of Troy Donohue, Burbank's ex-brother-in-law (she was in the fact the daughter of Nomad's foe, the drug lord Umberto Saffilios and a teenaged prostitute). Bushwacker hoped that his wife would approve of his \"rescue\" and welcome him back into her life.<ref>''Nomad'' #4-5 (Aug.\u2013Sept. 1992)</ref>\n\nImprisoned in the super-villain holding facility the Raft, Burbank escaped during the mass breakout engineered by [[Electro (comics)|Electro]]. Burbank was subsequently employed by the [[Jackal (Marvel Comics)|Jackal]] to kill the Punisher, but was defeated once again by Daredevil.<ref>''Daredevil vs. Punisher'' #3 (Oct. 2005)</ref> Following this, Bushwacker created a disturbance in downtown Manhattan and took a woman hostage to lure the [[Punisher]] out of hiding and kill him. The Punisher showed up as expected. As it turns out, G.W. Bridge arranged the incident in Times Square with Bushwacker to ambush and capture The Punisher. Although complications arose by an on-site NYPD officer the incident fell through, the Punisher escaped, and Bushwacker was defeated by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] operative [[G. W. Bridge]] and put back in jail.<ref>''Punisher War Journal'' vol. 2 #5 (May 2007)</ref>\n\nThe [[Hood (comics)|Hood]] has hired him as part of his criminal organization to take advantage of the split in the superhero community caused by the Superhuman Registration Act. He helped them fight the New Avengers but was taken down by Doctor Strange.<ref>''The New Avengers'' Annual #2 (2008)</ref>\n\nAs part of the Hood's gang, he later joins the fight against the Skrull invading force in New York City.<ref>''Secret Invasion'' #6 (November 2008)</ref> He was with the Hood when he presented the [[Mac Gargan#Scorpion|Scorpion costume]] to whichever crook impressed him until the party was crashed by [[Scorpion (Carmilla Black)|Scorpion]], who stole the costume.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #626 (May 2010)</ref>\n\nBushwacker was seen during the [[Siege (comics)|Siege]] of [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]] as part of the Hood crime syndicate.<ref>''The New Avengers'' #63 (May 2010)</ref>\n\nIn ''[[X-Force]]: Sex and Violence'' #2, Bushwacker was seriously injured by Wolverine after an assassination attempt on him and Domino. He was stabbed with a middle claw to the throat.<ref>''X-Force: Sex and Violence'' #2 (Oct. 2010)</ref>\n\nDuring the \"[[Civil War II]]\" storyline, Kingpin encounters Bushwacker in San Francisco.<ref>''Civil War II: Kingpin'' #1. [[Marvel Comics]].</ref>\n\nDuring a 2019 storyline in ''[[The Immortal Hulk]]'', Bushwacker appeared to be killed when Hulk exploded after being bathed in too much Gamma radiation.<ref>''[[The Immortal Hulk]]'' #17. [[Marvel Comics]].</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nBushwacker's arms and skin had been modified using malleable plastic that appears human, but has transformable biomolecular structure which affords him a great many unique powers and abilities. On top of this he has been altered bionically so that his hands can function as a gun, sword or other such armament he can think of.<ref>''[[The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z]]'' #2. [[Marvel Comics]].</ref>\n\nBurbank can fire bullets from his index finger as if his hand were a pistol. With a thought, he can alter the configuration of his right or left arm, allowing either to function in several modes that replicate the effects of a number of weapons. Including a machine gun, shotgun or even energy based cannonry. He employs powerful gadgets and weapons, most notably a flamethrower, all of which can be created by the mechanical prostheses that have replaced his forearms. He manages to load the weapons by swallowing ammo, such as bullets or flamethrower fuel. There are some versions that take this a step further, having Bushwacker be able to use highly concussive energy weaponry (very similar to that of Iron Man or War Machine),<ref>''[[Punisher War Journal]]'' vol. 2 #5. [[Marvel Comics]].</ref> and even be able to morph his arm into blades as a last resort. Bushwacker's skin can liquefy to seal wounds,<ref>''Nomad'' vol. 2 #5. [[Marvel Comics]].</ref> he even boasts a kind of healing ability that can seemingly revive him even from fatal injury.<ref>''X-Force: Sex and Violence'' #. [[Marvel Comics]].</ref>\n\nIn the ''Daredevil vs. Punisher'' miniseries, it was implied that his powers are actually a natural mutation, making the assassin himself one of the mutants he hates so much.<ref>''Daredevil vs. Punisher'' #3. [[Marvel Comics]].</ref>=\n\nBushwacker has been trained in CIA hand-to-hand combat techniques, and is trained in infiltration and assassination. He also has familiarity with the workings of international intelligence agencies and their methods.{{fact|date=June 2022}}\n\n==Other versions==\n===House of M===\nBushwacker appeared in the [[House of M]] reality spin-off ''House of M: Masters of Evil''.<ref>''House of M: Masters of Evil'' #1-4 (Oct. 2009\u2013Jan. 2010)</ref>\n\n==In other media==\n===Video games===\n* In the 1993 ''[[The Punisher (1993 video game)|The Punisher]]'' arcade game, Bushwacker is working for the [[Kingpin (character)|Kingpin]].{{cn|date=September 2016}}\n* Bushwacker is a boss in the 2004 video game ''[[The Punisher (2004 video game)|The Punisher]]'', voiced by Phil Hayes.{{cn|date=November 2021}} In this game, Bushwacker is a familiar foe to the Punisher, and works for [[Ma Gnucci|Gnucci family]].\n* Bushwacker is one of several playable characters in the [[PlayStation 3]] downloadable game ''[[The Punisher: No Mercy]]''.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.giantbomb.com/quick-look-the-punisher-no-mercy/17-992/ | title=Quick Look: ''The Punisher: No Mercy'' | work=Giant Bomb | access-date=2011-02-06}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://marvel.com/universe/Bushwacker Bushwacker] at Marvel.com\n* [http://marvel.wikia.com/wiki/Carl_Burbank_(Earth-616) Bushwacker] at Marvel Wiki\n\n{{Daredevil}}\n{{Punisher}}\n{{Spider-Man characters}}\n{{Ann Nocenti}}\n\n[[Category:Characters created by Ann Nocenti]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1987]]\n[[Category:Fictional assassins in comics]]\n[[Category:Fictional Central Intelligence Agency personnel]]\n[[Category:Fictional gunfighters]]\n[[Category:Fictional murderers]]\n[[Category:Fictional priests and priestesses]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters who are shapeshifters]]<!--His arms can morph into various forms of guns-->\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters with accelerated healing]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters with superhuman strength]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics cyborgs]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics male supervillains]]\n[[Category:Punisher characters]]"}]}}}}
