The character first appeared in ''[[Eternal (comics)|The Eternals]]'' #11 (May 1977), and was created by [[Jack Kirby]]. He is depicted as a member of the [[Eternals (comics)|Eternals]], a race of [[superhumans]] in the [[Marvel Universe]].\n\n[[Barry Keoghan]] portrays Druig in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] film ''[[Eternals (film)|Eternals]]'' (2021).\n\n==Publication history==\nDruig first appeared in ''[[Eternal (comics)|The Eternals]]'' #11 (May 1977), and was created by [[Jack Kirby]].\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nDruig is the son of [[Valkin]] and cousin to [[Ikaris]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbr.com/eternals-villain-druig-explained/|title=Eternals: Who is Druig, the MCU Film's Presumed Villain?|last=Hayes|first=Jackson|website=[[Comic Book Resources]]|date=August 25, 2019|access-date=August 25, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190825152028/https://www.cbr.com/eternals-villain-druig-explained/|archive-date=August 25, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn modern times, Druig served as an agent of the [[KGB]] in [[Russia]], and found that he enjoyed torturing people. When [[Ziran the Tester]] came through Polaria, Druig planned to slay him using \"the Weapon\", which he had learned of by torturing his cousin [[Ikaris]], but Ikaris disintegrated Druig before he could fire the Weapon.<ref>''The Eternals'' #11</ref> His body was recovered by the [[Celestial (comics)|Celestials]] and put into everlasting containment at the Desecration Annex.<ref>''The Eternals'' #6</ref>\n\n===''Eternals'' (2006)===\nMuch later, Druig is now deputy Prime Minister of Vorozheika (a fictional country to the northeast of [[Chechnya]], formerly part of the [[USSR]]) and is currently using the name '''Ivan Druig'''. Druig hires [[Sersi]] to organize a party at the Vorozheikan embassy, asking her to invite wealthy guests and prominent scientists. He then arranges for armed men to storm the party, kidnapping the scientists and manufacturing a hostage situation - however, his troops betrayed him and he swiftly lost control of the situation.\n\nAt this point, like [[Makkari (comics)|Mark Curry]], Druig's powers inexplicably \"kick in\". Unlike Mark Curry, he immediately gains control over his powers. He has displayed a limited form of telepathy, allowing him to view a person's most traumatic memory - and then immobilise them by forcing them to face that memory again. However, he does not appear to be able to read other memories from a target's mind. Druig also seems able to conceal his presence, by influencing the minds of others so that they do not see him - so far, the limits of this ability are unclear.\n\nReturning to Vorozheika, Druig then seizes control of an army unit and then quickly rounds up all heads of the government.  He then has all the people involved in the betrayal at the embassy dragged before him and the government heads, and gives the heads a choice. They either kill a betrayer, or kill themselves. After one government head tries killing Druig, and is then forced to kill himself, the other heads all turn on the betrayers.\n\nHe then leaves to find the other Eternals, and help them prevent the [[Dreaming Celestial]] from destroying the Earth. In the end of the series, he remains absolute ruler of Vorozheika. While he in fact despises the people of Vorozheika, seeing them all as beneath him, he gladly uses his position to send out people in his intelligence services to find other \"unawakened\" Eternals before Thena and Ikaris, so as to mold their mind in their weakened state into following him, and using their combined forces to become the leader of the Eternals.\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nDruig possesses the conventional abilities of an Eternal. He can manipulate all forms of matter and energy, including the atoms of his own body, [[Teleportation|teleport]], [[Mind control in popular culture|control the minds of others]], project energy from his body (usually from the hands or eyes), and manipulate gravity in order to fly.\n\n==Reception==\n* In 2021, ''[[CBR.com]]'' ranked Druig 15th in their \"15 Most Powerful Eternals\" list.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Lealos |first=Shawn S. |date=2019-07-27 |title=The 15 Most Powerful Eternals, Ranked |url=https://www.cbr.com/most-powerful-eternals-ranked/ |access-date=2022-10-14 |website=CBR |language=en-US}}</ref>\n* In 2021, ''[[CBR.com]]'' ranked Druig 9th in their \"10 Strongest Characters From Eternals Comics\" list.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Harth |first=David |date=2021-11-13 |title=The 10 Strongest Characters From Eternals Comics |url=https://www.cbr.com/eternals-comics-strong-powerful-characters-marvel/ |access-date=2022-08-30 |website=CBR |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n==In other media==\n===Television===\n* Druig appears in ''Marvel Knights: Eternals'', voiced by [[Alex Zahara]].<ref name=\"btva\">{{cite web | title=Druig Voice - Eternals (Show) <nowiki>|</nowiki> Behind The Voice Actors | url=https://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/tv-shows/Eternals/Druig/ | work=Behind The Voice Actors | access-date=October 17, 2017| postscript=.
