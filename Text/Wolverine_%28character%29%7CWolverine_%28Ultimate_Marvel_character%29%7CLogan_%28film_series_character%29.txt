He is an alternative version of [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] that appears in the [[Ultimate Marvel]] imprint, in stories separate from the original character. Created by writer [[Mark Millar]] and artist [[Adam Kubert]] (based on the original character created by [[Roy Thomas]], [[Len Wein]] and [[John Romita Sr.]]), Ultimate Wolverine first appeared in ''[[Ultimate X-Men]]'' #1 (February 2001).\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n===Early years===\nWolverine suffered from amnesia. As a result, what little was known about his early life was both suspect and unverifiable. It is believed that, at one point, Wolverine had a wife or girlfriend, but she was supposedly murdered by [[Sabretooth (character)#Ultimate Marvel|Sabretooth]]. As both Wolverine's and Sabretooth's memories had been tampered with in the past (most commonly by the [[Weapon X]]), this claim was highly suspect; however, Wolverine did own a wedding ring that served as his only link to his past. He also owned dogtags. One side read 'Logan' and the other side 'Wolverine'.<ref name=\"Ultimate X-Men #2\">''Ultimate X-Men'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref><ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #6. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n[[Captain America (Ultimate Marvel character)|Captain America]] recognized Wolverine as James Howlett, a paratrooper he had made several jumps with during [[World War II]]. He was called \"'''Lucky Jim'''\" because he always survived, no matter how gravely he was injured. [[Dum-Dum Dugan]] also recognized him as Jim although how he knew him has not yet been specified.<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #39. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n''[[Ultimate Origins]]'' depicts [[Nick Fury (Ultimate Marvel character)|Nick Fury]] and [[Kingpin (character)#Ultimate Marvel|Kingpin]]'s unnamed grandfather as looting a house for its goods only to be caught and taken hostage. Tests were conducted on Fury to see if he was a candidate to become a super soldier, and a little over a year later Howlett was also tested but escaped. Howlett's newly activated mutant abilities kicked in. This was considered the dawn of the mutant race, and Howlett was named \"Mutant Zero.\" At some point in later years he was captured by Erik Lensherr's parents in a plan to 'cure' the mutant gene. When Lensherr discovered the plot he helped to free Wolverine, but not before killing his mother and father. Years later he was experimented on by Weapon X who gave him his [[adamantium]] claws by [[Malcolm Colcord#Ultimate Marvel|Malcolm Colcord]].<ref>''Ultimate Origins'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n===Weapon X===\nWolverine was kidnapped by [[Kestrel (Marvel Comics)#Ultimate Marvel|John Wraith]], a mutant-hating commando, and head of the Weapon X Project. His memory was erased and was given the fake name \"Logan\". He was often tortured and tormented by Wraith and his guards. It was during this time his skeletal structure was bonded with Adamantium. While being deployed in the desert during the Gulf War, the vehicle he was in was ambushed, and Wolverine was set loose from his cage. He slaughtered the enemies and came across Nick Fury, the only other survivor, who was injured. Logan carried him back to base, though he was then shot and caged once again. Wraith was surprised that his \"living weapon\" still retained his humanity.<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #35-37. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nA couple years later, Logan broke out of Weapon X with the help of Fury, who never forgot about the man who saved his life.<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #33. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nLogan later traveled to the Balkan Mountains. After being overwhelmed by a snow storm, he was taken in by a woman named Magda aka \"The Witch of [[Wundagore]]\". While recovering, Logan had intercourse with Magda, but was interrupted by her current boyfriend [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Eric Lensherr]]. Using his powers, Lensherr quickly dispatched Logan- hurling him from the mountain forcing him to wander in the wild alone.<ref>''Ultimates 3'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nYears later, Wolverine joined Magneto's [[Brotherhood of Mutants#Ultimate Marvel|Brotherhood of Mutant Supremacy]], and eventually became Magneto's elite [[assassin]].<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n===Joining the X-Men===\nEighteen months later, Logan was assigned to infiltrate the X-Men and assassinate [[Professor X#Ultimate Marvel|Professor X]]. He was accepted into their ranks, and quickly seduced [[Jean Grey#Ultimate Marvel|Jean Grey]] in order to further entrench himself within the team. However, Wolverine accidentally fell in love with Jean, and was devastated when she left him upon discovering his connection to the Brotherhood. Wolverine eventually betrayed Magneto, abandoning his initial mission and truly joined the X-Men after coming to understand and believe in Xavier's cause.<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #6. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nSeeking answers to Wolverine's past (and to liberate imprisoned mutant test subjects), the team traveled to the site of the Weapon X Project. There they encountered Wraith - and Sabretooth. Sabretooth burned the files on Wolverine - and thus destroyed the only record of his past - in front of his eyes, leading up to the first match-up between the two. At first, Sabretooth appeared to be winning, until Wolverine scored a dirty hit (slashing Sabretooth in the groin). The battle culminated with Sabretooth's plunge off of a cliff and the complete dismantlement of the Weapon X Project.<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #39. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nUnfortunately, by this time, Jean had begun a relationship with [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Cyclops]], leading to a deep rift growing between the two men. Their rivalry came to a head when Xavier sent the two of them on a mission to the [[Savage Land]], hoping to end their enmity. However, the reverse occurred: Wolverine allowed Cyclops to fall to his death, believing he would then be able to continue his relationship with Jean.<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #20-25. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nMiraculously, Cyclops survived, and returned, revealing Wolverine's hand in his disappearance. Cyclops blasted Wolverine to the ground, and then shocked everyone by offering to let him remain on the team (his only chance of redemption).<ref name=\"Ultimate X-Men #2\"/>\n\nThis experience had a profound effect upon Logan. He realized how badly he had betrayed his friends and ceased his antisocial, ruthless ways, and even developed a deep and abiding sense of responsibility. He also displayed a protective side for the younger X-Men, namely [[Rogue (Marvel Comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Rogue]], and even eventually formed a bond of friendship - or at least mutual respect - with Cyclops.<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #28. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nWolverine's nemesis was far from destroyed as Sabretooth returned as a member of the Brotherhood of Mutant Supremacy, replacing Wolverine at Magneto's side. After a fierce battle, Sabretooth began to taunt Wolverine, saying that he could never be killed, could recover from any injury, and would always return to haunt Wolverine - to which Wolverine responded by decapitating him on the spot.<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #9-12. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nWolverine later began a half-hearted relationship with [[Storm (Marvel Comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Storm]], which he quickly ended. However, they both still harbored feelings for one another, and on a future \"date\", the couple were attacked by a revived Sabretooth (sporting a scar around his neck).<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #44. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nSabretooth began to explain how he managed to survive thanks to a few little threads Wolverine neglected to cut, but was rendered comatose for several months. He engaged Wolverine in a brief encounter, until Storm separated the two, inadvertently allowing Sabretooth to take her hostage. Sabretooth said he hadn't come to fight, and revealed that, since his resurrection, his original memories had begun to return. He had become able to determine which memories were fake, as well. He also claimed that Wolverine was his biological father. This claim is unverified.<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #40. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n===''Ultimate Wolverine Vs. Hulk''===\n{{Main|Ultimate Wolverine Vs. Hulk}}\nWolverine was contacted by Nick Fury, who was concerned that the [[Hulk (Ultimate Marvel character)|Hulk]] may have survived S.H.I.E.L.D.'s attempt to execute him. Fury assigned Wolverine to find the Hulk, who S.H.I.E.L.D. believed to be in Tibet, and eliminate him. Wolverine tracked down the Hulk in Tibet, where he greeted him. To Wolverine's surprise Banner is in complete control of himself as the Hulk. Hulk and Wolverine exchange words, with Hulk belittling Wolverine's intelligence, and also revealed that Fury ordered the Ultimates to kill Logan if he ever abandons the X-Men. Logan then informed Hulk that [[Betty Ross#Ultimate Marvel|Betty Ross]] wants him dead, angering Hulk. Wolverine is about to leave but then asked if he could ask Betty out which infuriated Hulk to attack Wolverine.<ref>''Ultimate Wolverine vs. Hulk'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nAfter a vicious exchange, the Hulk gained the upper hand and proceeded to rip Wolverine in half. Wolverine survived, and began the long climb up a mountainside to retrieve his legs. Unfortunately for Logan the Hulk is already there when Wolverine arrives. Hulk says that he will eat one of his legs in order to force Wolverine to leave Hulk alone, but Wolverine says that he will never stop chasing Bruce until he kills him. Then She-Hulk arrives and confronts an angry Hulk, Wolverine reattaches his legs as Hulk attacks an atomic bomb sent by Fury. Fury then decapitated Wolverine, demanding information, which Logan did not completely give. Locked in the [[Triskelion (comics)|Triskelion]], Wolverine met [[Forge (character)#Ultimate Marvel|Forge]] (a former [[Brotherhood of Mutants|Brotherhood]] member), and the two escaped. Wolverine reunited with Betty Ross in a hotel room. Ross transformed into She-Hulk and attacked Wolverine, but Wolverine quickly stabbed She-Hulk, which left her in critical condition. Ross begged Wolverine to spare Bruce, but he refused<ref>''Ultimate Wolverine vs. Hulk'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nLater, Logan went to the airport where Bruce was, got on the same plane, and sat next to him. Logan put a collar made by Forge on Bruce, telling him that if he turns into Hulk while the collar is on him, he will choke to death. Bruce asks why Logan simply won't just kill him and get it over with, and Logan says that he didn't want to kill Bruce, he wanted to kill the Hulk. Bruce said that he did not deserve the treatment and that he was a good person, but Logan replied that he is a bad person and that it is irrelevant what either person deserves.<ref>''Ultimate Wolverine vs. Hulk'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nBruce said that he does not believe that Logan is a bad person and will prove it. Bruce then said that he wouldn't change, and then jumped out of the airplane emergency exit in mid-flight. Logan jumped out after him screaming at him to turn into the Hulk or the fall would kill him. Bruce said that he would only change if Logan would cut off the collar, or else Logan would have to deal with the fact that he simply let \"Bruce,\" and not the \"Hulk\" fall to his death. Logan, not wanting to be responsible for Bruce's death, shows his moral side and breaks the collar. Bruce transforms into the Hulk, holds Logan, and lands on his feet with no harm done to either of them. Nick Fury showed up and told them that they were free to go. Fury angrily warns Wolverine that he is now on his %^&* list, but Wolverine states that he is on humanity's %^&* list. Hulk let Fury go, who then left. In the middle of the desert, Hulk and Logan calmly discuss getting back to civilization, and Hulk agrees to pick up Logan and jump to the nearest town to drop him off.<ref>''Ultimate Wolverine vs. Hulk'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n===Pre-''Ultimatum /'' Banshee===\nWolverine found out that he was dosed with Banshee and goes to [[Spider-Man (Ultimate Marvel character)|Peter Parker]] for help. He discovered that he wasn't actually dosed, but that properties of the drug were derived from him. Because certain members of the X-Men like [[Warren Worthington III#Ultimate Marvel|Angel]], [[Colossus (character)#Ultimate Marvel|Colossus]], [[Dazzler (Marvel Comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Dazzler]], [[Nightcrawler (character)#Ultimate Marvel|Nightcrawler]], and Rogue became Banshee addicts with Angel gaining a humanoid eagle form, Colossus getting strong enough to move his metallic form, Dazzler creating solid light constructs, Nightcrawler teleporting greater distances, and Rogue touching things without draining it's lifeforce, the non-addicted members were forced to fight them and prevent them from using it. When Jean fell unconscious, he violently attacked Colossus, but soon cooled off. He then discovered that Xavier and Magneto were responsible for the creation of the power-enhancing drug and that [[Moira MacTaggert#Ultimate Marvel|Moira MacTaggert]] was distributing it. Moira fought him, though he destroyed the facility in which Banshee was produced in.<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #94-96. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n===''Ultimatum and Death'' ===\n{{Main|Ultimatum (Ultimate Marvel)}}\nWolverine is forced to travel to the Savage Land to find the brainwashed [[Jamie Madrox#Ultimate Marvel|Multiple Man]] and kill him, to stop the waves of Multiple Man suicide bombers worldwide. He vows to do the same thing to Magneto. When the X-Men and the [[Ultimates]] finally confront Magneto, Wolverine charges towards his foe, slashing him multiple times before Magneto overrides [[Iron Man (Ultimate Marvel character)|Iron Man]]'s armor and Cyclops' visor to unleash full strength blasts from both to incinerate Wolverine. Believing him to be dead, Magneto gets too close to gloat before Wolverine. The nearly fleshless Wolverine jumps up and stabs his claws into Magneto's chest, mortally wounding him. Magneto rips the Adamantium from Wolverine's bones, killing Wolverine, leaving just a severely [[charred]] skeleton and an arm of flesh due to his healing factor not working. Cyclops would later avenge Wolverine's death by killing Magneto<ref>''Ultimatum'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref> Shadowcat returns to Triskelion to find Wolverine's fleshless arm (the one that was left in Magneto after Wolverine was killed). Shadowcat returns to the site of the mansion with Wolverine's arm and adds it to the grave of the fallen X-Men.<ref>''Ultimatum'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n===Legacy===\nAfter Wolverine's death, it was revealed he had a biological son with Magda named [[Jimmy Hudson]]. Hudson inherited the claws, healing factor, and facial hair of his father and in addition to these he inherited a unique ability of his own an ability to coat his bone claws with a liquid metal similar to adamantium. After the [[Ultimate Marvel|Ultimate Universe]] is destroyed, Hudson moves into [[Earth-616]].<ref>[http://io9.gizmodo.com/an-old-foe-and-a-familiar-face-join-the-young-x-men-of-1794272985 An Old Foe and a Familiar Face Join the Young Mutants of X-Men Blue]</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nWolverine has a healing factor that allows him to recover from wounds fairly quickly. Wolverine's healing factor makes him capable of surviving without his legs or even his head attached to his body. Wolverine's healing factor was not strong enough in the end to defend Wolverine from having himself be obliterated by Magneto who tears the adamantium from his body. Wolverine's mutant power in the Ultimate Universe has been described as the ability to \"survive\" as opposed to just \"heal\". It is commonly thought that Wolverine's death in Ultimatum was counter to continuity, as previously Wolverine had survived being ripped in half, decapitation, and a nuclear explosion.\n\nWolverine also has a keen sense of smell and is able to detect lies.\n\n==Other versions==\nIn an alternate future labeled '''Earth-2107''', Logan goes by the name '''Cable'''. <ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.cbr.com/wolverine-marvel-cable-ultimate-old-man-logan/ | title=Wolverine: How Marvel Turned Cable into the Ultimate Old Man Logan | date=11 May 2020 }}</ref> <ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #75</ref>\n\nHowlett known as Cable's life was identical to the present time Wolverine, until [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] arrived and battled the X-Men. Many of the team died during the battle, and Apocalypse absorbed Cable's healing factor and ripped off his left arm. Some time after the battle was over with Apocalypse the victor, Cable's left arm was used against him and it scarred his face. Because of his lack of healing factor, the scarring on his face remained. Cable then spent the next three decades fighting Apocalypse until he finally found a way to travel back in time, and as soon as he could Cable traveled back 30 years to correct the past.\nCable traveled from the future, appearing before [[Charles Xavier]]. Cable prepared to kill Xavier, claiming it to be necessary. However, he hesitated, allowing Charles to defend himself telekinetically. <ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #75</ref>\n\nXavier asked Cable how he was blocking Charles' telepathy, but the man refused to reveal how, calling it a \"secret\". Cable then tossed a small device at Xavier, which attached itself to his head and (painfully) rendered him powerless. However, Kitty then arrived, and phased Cable through the floor. Cable stabbed her in the gut, and warned her not to become solid again, not even enough to remove the knife, or she will bleed to death. He then apologized for putting her in this situation. Cable proceeded to face each of the X-Men, defeating them all: he knocked [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] unconscious, deflected [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]]'s blasts with his metal arm (burying Cyclops in rubble), defeated [[Jean Grey]] with the same device he used against Xavier, and attacked [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] with a device that turned her own powers against her.\n\nWhen he was attacked by Wolverine, he held his own for a while, until the X-Man flew into a rage, attacking Cable mercilessly, until he was pushed back, speechless from the claw marks crossing his chest.\nCable was then revealed to have unsheathed claws identical to Wolverine's from his organic arm. As the X-Men believed the Professor to be dead, Cable actually transported him back to the future to prepare him for the battle with Apocalypse. [[Bishop (Marvel Comics)|Bishop]], who had pretended that he was against Cable, was trying to build an X-team strong enough to defeat Apocalypse under orders of the US Government. When they returned to the present, [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] was attacking Apocalypse, who defeated them with ease. \n\nWhile Apocalypse was able to repel all attacks with ease, the armored Xavier/[[Onslaught (Marvel Comics)|Onslaught]] convinced Jean to aid as Cable in his own [[Stryfe|armor]] pleads to Bishop and [[Six Pack (comics)|his team]]. Meanwhile Jean was momentarily shocked about the professor being back, and Jean, Cyclops, [[Toad (Marvel Comics)|Toad]], and [[Iceman (Marvel Comics)|Iceman]] were no longer in Apocalypse's control due to Xavier's honed abilities. Cable revealed that he and Bishop were in it together all along and that Professor X was the key to stopping Apocalypse. Wolverine jumped in at the end of Cable's explanation and told them all to start fighting. Professor X and Jean shared a tender moment on a rocky peak, told her what to do and then Apocalypse jumps in. Xavier tried to wipe out Apocalypse psychically, but Cable's plan backfires as Apocalypse somehow resisted. Apocalypse destroyed Xavier's helmet, giving him a bloody nose, and as he was about to kill Cable, Xavier used his enhanced telekinesis but to little effect.\n\nAs Apocalypse was about to kill Xavier, Jean begged the [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix God]] to help him, to which it told her it knew she would eventually beg for it. The Phoenix was then unleashed and Jean destroyed Apocalypse, reverting him back into [[Mister Sinister|Nathaniel Essex/Sinister]], followed by her making sure no one remembers Apocalypse except for the X-Men. The people who had died came back to life and Wolverine's body/healing factor were fully restored, effectively diverting the possibility of his becoming this version of himself. <ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #93</ref>\n\n==In other media==\n===Television===\nIn ''[[X-Men: Evolution]]'', Wolverine (voiced by [[Scott McNeil]]) sports the Ultimate version of his costume in Seasons 3 & 4.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://marvel.toonzone.net/news.php?action=fullnews&id=806 |title=Marvel Animation Age |website=marvel.toonzone.net |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120528091447/http://marvel.toonzone.net/news.php?action=fullnews&id=806 |archive-date=2012-05-28}} </ref>\n\n===Video games===\n* Wolverine appears in the video game  ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (video game)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]'', voiced by [[Keith Szarabajka]].

In response, Sentinels are deployed at the conference and are disposed of by Cyclops and Wolverine.

As Cyclops begins to deploy X-Men around the globe to deal with the threat, Wolverine returns to Utopia to find Hope Summers and the Lights waiting for their combat training lesson. After insulting Hope's team and realizing that Idie is losing her childhood, Wolverine asks Kitty Pryde to make him a doll to give to Idie.

The new Hellfire Club attacks the exhibit and incapacitates all senior X-Men present. As Wolverine rushes to the museum to help from the bar and Cyclops flies in from Utopia, Idie asks if she should kill the Hellfire Club to help. While Wolverine protests against it profusely, Cyclops tells Idie to do what she feels is right. Idie kills almost every Hellfire Club member left to save her friends and mentors.

While Wolverine tries to stop the sentinel from maturing, he is thrown into the ocean. Shortly after, Wolverine swims on to Utopia and tells the mutant children that they need to leave. Cyclops tells the students to fight together and that they can beat the sentinel, but Wolverine objects to using children to fight battles. Cyclops does not listen and begins to prepare the students for combat. Shortly after Wolverine returns with a detonator to blow up Utopia and orders all remaining people on the island to evacuate. Cyclops and Wolverine's frustration with each other comes to a head when Cyclops brings up [[Jean Grey]] saying that she never loved Wolverine and always feared him. Wolverine replies \"And if she were here right now, who do you think she would be more frightened of?\" The two fight each other in a rage while being attacked by the sentinel and as Wolverine claws into Cyclops' visor, the students reappear on the battlefield to help them fight the sentinel. In the morning, Cyclops and Wolverine stand victorious with the students all living, but Wolverine cannot continue watching Cyclops use children as soldiers to fight these battles. Wolverine announces his departure from Utopia and indicates he will take any mutant on the island who wants to leave with him.

The shell is cracked when the Reavers attempt to steal Wolverine's corpse and shortly after that attack, Kitty visits the 'real' grave and realizes that it is empty. Kitty contacts Daredevil and Tony Stark for help finding who took Wolverine, but all are left concerned at the questions of who would even know the location of the true grave- which was known only by a few key X-Men- and whether Wolverine was stolen or 'woke up' on his own as the X-Men also began their investigation, leaving the time-displaced Jean Grey alone in the cabin.<ref>''Hunt for Wolverine'' #1</ref> At the same time, some of Wolverine's worst enemies hear what happened and join the hunt.<ref>''Hunt for Wolverine'' #1.

Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n===Return of Wolverine===\nThe ''[[Return of Wolverine]]'' miniseries focusing on Wolverine's resurrection opens with Wolverine having been brought back to life in an amnesic state by an initially unidentified force, forcing him on a search for answers as he learns that he is being hunted by a force capable of reanimating the dead. He eventually realizes that he was brought back to life by Persephone, who has used her ability to revive the dead to restore various people to act as her agents and complete certain key assignments to arrange for the construction of a complex satellite network. The completion of this network would allow her to 'kill' humanity and then revive them in a state where she could control the amount of brainpower they possessed, allowing her to use some of them as drones while others would be capable of more independent action to benefit her regime. However, when she revived Logan to assist her, his restoration also reactivated his healing factor, allowing him to come back to life on his own after his assignment for Persephone had concluded, with Logan restoring enough of his memory to accept that he had to destroy Persephone's satellite base, surviving the subsequent crash to Earth.<ref>''Return of Wolverine'' #1-5.

As his teammates fall one by one and racing against time due to Orchis' premature activation of the Mother Mold, Wolverine and [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] volunteer for a [[suicide mission]] to teleport into the vacuum of space directly on top of the unguarded [[Docking and berthing of spacecraft|docking collar]]'s last remaining [[coupling]]. The two longtime friends then say their goodbyes to each other, with Kurt assuring Logan that he need not worry about the fate of his soul, as he will be waiting to welcome him into [[Heaven in Christianity|the afterlife]]. As Nightcrawler is disintegrated moments after arriving by the intense heat of the sun, Wolverine's body immediately ignites into flames and he succeeds in cutting through the coupling before he and the [[Self-awareness|awakening]] Mother Mold are vaporized as they fall into the sun.<ref>''House of X'' #4.

In the midst of his travels, Wolverine will relive certain moments from his own long-forgotten past as well. Upon revisiting the past, is revealed that Wolverine was present during the birth of Charles Xavier and indirectly [[Cassandra Nova]], having saved his family from an invading Omega Red, when the Russian mutant possessed some of Xavier family's butlers and nurse.<ref>''X-Lives of Wolverine'' (2022). Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n===Judgment Day===\nDuring the \"[[Judgment Day (Marvel Comics)|Judgment Day]]\" storyline, Wolverine was with the Quiet Council when Jack of Knives leads the attack on Krakoa. After killing some opponents, Wolverine finds Egg badly wounded and takes an attack from Jack of Knives as he tells Jean Grey to have the Five protected. After the opponents retreat, Wolverine learns from Nightcrawler on what Uranos the Undying did on Arrako.<ref>''A.X.E.: Judgment Day'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nWolverine is a mutant with a number of both natural and artificial improvements to his physiology.\n\n===Healing and defensive powers===\n[[File:Wolverine-first-claws.jpg|upright|thumb|Depiction of Wolverine using his claws for the first time in ''[[Origin (comics)|Origin]]'' #2 (2001). Art by Andy Kubert and Richard Isanove.]]\nWolverine's primary mutant power is an accelerated healing process, typically referred to as his mutant [[Healing|healing factor]], that regenerates damaged or destroyed tissues of his body far beyond that of normal humans. In addition to accelerated healing of physical traumas, Wolverine's healing factor makes him extraordinarily resistant to diseases, drugs and toxins. However, he can still suffer the immediate effects of such substances in massive quantities; he has been seen to become intoxicated after ingesting significant amounts of alcohol,<ref>''Wolverine'' #3 (Nov. 1982). Marvel Comics.</ref> and has been incapacitated on several occasions with large amounts of powerful drugs and poisons;<ref>''Marvel Comics Presents'' #87 (1991). Marvel Comics.</ref> [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] once managed to keep Wolverine anesthetized by constantly pumping eighty milliliters of anesthetic a minute into his system.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nA study by the [[University of British Columbia]] states that Wolverine's healing factor resembles the [[axolotl]]'s ability to regenerate lost limbs. It suggests that a novel protein\u2014which the study's authors dubbed Howlett\u2014found in tissue samples taken from him, and which resembles the Amblox protein found in axolotl but is much more efficient, is responsible for Wolverine's rapid regeneration.<ref name=\"ubc201302\">{{cite web | url=http://www.scq.ubc.ca/howlett-novel-wolverine-protein-contributes-to-rapid-regeneration-and-heightened-cellular-replication/ | title=Howlett: Novel Wolverine Protein Contributes to Rapid Regeneration and Heightened Cellular Replication | publisher=University of British Columbia | work=Science Creative Quarterly | date=February 2013 | access-date=24 September 2013 |author1=Alvarez, Sigrid |author2=Conway, Emma}}</ref> His healing factor allowed him to survive the experimental surgical binding of the virtually indestructible metal [[adamantium]] to his bones and claws, to which he was subjected under the Weapon X program (in later comics called the Weapon Plus program). While the adamantium in his body stops or reduces many injuries, such as broken bones and decapitation, his healing factor must also work constantly to prevent metal poisoning from killing him. When his healing powers were rendered inactive, [[Beast (Marvel Comics)|Beast]] synthesized a drug to counteract the adamantium poisoning.<ref name=\"Wolverinevol\"/>\n\nWolverine's healing factor also dramatically affects his aging process, allowing him to live far beyond the normal lifespan of normal humans. Despite being born in the late 19th century,<ref>''Origin''. Marvel Comics.</ref> he has the appearance, conditioning, health and vitality of a man in his physical prime. While seemingly ageless, it is unknown exactly how greatly his healing factor extends his life expectancy.\n\nAlthough Wolverine's body heals, the healing factor does not suppress the pain he endures while injured.<ref>''Wolverine'' vol. 3, #65 (Oct. 2007). Marvel Comics.</ref> Wolverine also admits to feeling phantom pains for weeks or months after healing from his injuries.<ref>''X-Men Unlimited'' #12 (Dec. 2005).

Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nDepictions of the speed and extent of injury to which Wolverine can heal vary due to a broad degree of artistic license employed by various comic book writers. Originally, this was portrayed as accelerated healing of minor wounds,<ref>''X-Men'' #107 (Oct. 1977). Marvel Comics.</ref> though [[Chris Claremont]], head writer of the X-Men comics from the mid-1970s to the early 1990s increased Wolverine's healing factor substantially, though not nearly as much as later writers would. During the 1980s, Wolverine's mutant healing factor is depicted as being able to heal massive levels of trauma, though his recovery time could extend to days, weeks or months before fully healing; often depending upon the severity of the injuries, their extent and the frequency with which they are inflicted.<ref name=\"Wolverine vol.1 #2 October 1982\">''Wolverine'' #2 (Oct. 1982).

Marvel Comics.</ref> Wolverine has also stated that his body actually heals faster when the injury is grave or life-threatening.<ref>''Classic X-Men'' #10 (June 1987). Marvel Comics.</ref> During the 1990s through the modern era, other writers have increased Wolverine's healing factor to the point that it could fully regenerate nearly any damaged or destroyed bodily tissues within seconds.<ref>''Wolverine'' vol. 2, #92 (Aug. 1995). Marvel Comics.</ref><ref>''Wolverine'' vol. 2, #115 (Aug. 1997). Marvel Comics.</ref><ref>''X-Men'' vol. 2, #150 (Feb. 2004). Marvel Comics.</ref> Among the more extreme depictions of Wolverine's healing factor include fully healing after being caught near the center of an [[atomic explosion]]<ref>''Logan'' #2 (June 2008). Marvel Comics.</ref> and the total regeneration of his soft body tissue, within a matter of minutes, after having it incinerated from his skeleton.<ref>''Wolverine'' vol. 3, #43 (Aug. 2006). Marvel Comics.</ref> An explanation is given in a recent mini-series starring Wolverine for the increase of his healing powers. In the series, Wolverine is referred to as an \"adaptive self-healer\" after undergoing numerous traumatic injuries to test the efficiency of his healing factor. Wolverine has endured so much trauma, and so frequently, that his healing factor has adapted, becoming faster and more efficient to cope with increasing levels of trauma.<ref>''Wolverine: The Best There Is'' #4 (May 2011). Marvel Comics.</ref> The [[Xavier Protocols]], a series of profiles created by Xavier that lists the strengths and weaknesses of the X-Men, say that Wolverine's healing factor is increased to \"incredible levels\" and theorizes that the only way to stop him is to [[decapitation|decapitate]] him and remove his head from the vicinity of his body.<ref>''Excalibur'' #100. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nIt is possible to suppress the efficiency of Wolverine's healing powers; for example, if an object composed of [[adamantium]] is inserted and remains lodged within his body, his healing powers are slowed dramatically.<ref>''Wolverine: Origins'' #7. Marvel Comics.</ref> The [[Muramasa]] blade, a [[katana]] of mystic origins that can inflict wounds that nullify superhuman healing factors, can also suppress Wolverine's powers.<ref>''Wolverine: Origins'' #39 (Oct. 2009). Marvel Comics.</ref> It has also been noted that Wolverine needs protein for his healing factor to generate tissue, meaning that if he was seriously injured and malnourished, his body might not be able to repair itself.<ref>''Wolverine'' #67 (Feb. 1992). Marvel Comics.</ref> His healing factor has also been turned off using nanites.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Marvel Encyclopedia: Updated and Expanded}}</ref>\n\nIt has been suggested that Wolverine can be killed by [[drowning]].<ref>''Wolverine'' vol. 2, #19 (Dec. 1989). Marvel Comics.</ref> He has said that he is not particularly fond of being in the water, due partially to the weight of his adamantium laced skeleton, and that he can die if held underwater long enough - his healing factor would only prolong the agony.<ref>''Wolverine: Weapon X'' #5 (Nov. 2009). Marvel Comics.</ref> The two-part story arc \"Drowning Logan\" finds Wolverine trapped underwater for an extensive period of time.<ref>''Wolverine'' (vol. 5) #5 (Jun. 2013). Marvel Comics.</ref> The second part of the story arc hints that this experience weakens his healing factor and future health.<ref>''Wolverine'' #6 & 8 (2013). Marvel Comics.</ref> Following \"Drowning Logan\", [[Beast (Marvel Comics)|Beast]] reveals that an \"intelligent virus\" originating from the [[Microverse]] has shut off his healing factor, though not before it purged his body of the virus, leaving him as susceptible to injury, disease, and aging as any ordinary human.<ref name=\"Wolverinevol\">{{cite comic|Publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]|Penciller=Pierfederici, Mirco|Inker=[[Karl Kesel|Kesel, Karl]]|Date=September 2013|Issue=#7|Writer=[[Paul Cornell|Cornell, Paul]]|Title=[[Wolverine (comic book)|Wolverine]]}}</ref>\n\n''Wolverine'' vol. 3, #57 reveals that when Wolverine is injured so seriously that his body actually dies before his healing factor can repair the damage, he returns to life by fighting with Azrael, the Angel of Death, while trapped in Purgatory because Wolverine defeated Azrael in real-world combat during World War I.<ref>''Wolverine'' (vol. 3) #57. Marvel Comics.</ref> However, after Wolverine's resurrection and brainwashing by the Hand, he made a new deal with Azrael that repaired the damage to his soul, negated their previous arrangement, and weakened his healing factor slightly - and the next time Wolverine sustains death-inducing injuries, he will remain dead.<ref>''Wolverine'' (vol. 3) #61. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nDue to a combination of Wolverine's healing factor and high-level [[Psionics|psionic]] shields implanted by Professor Xavier, Wolverine's mind is highly resistant to [[Telepathy|telepathic]] assault and probing.<ref>''Wolverine'' vol. 3, #46 (Nov. 2006)</ref> Wolverine's mind also possesses what he refers to as \"mental scar tissue\" created by the traumatic events of his life. It acts as a type of natural defense, even against a psychic as powerful as [[Emma Frost]].<ref>''X-Men: Original Sin'' (Dec. 2008). Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n===Other abilities===\nWolverine's mutation also consists of animal-like adaptations of his body, including superhuman senses, such as an increased sense of smell and hearing; pronounced, sharp, fang-like canines; and three retractable claws housed within each forearm. While originally depicted as bionic implants created by the Weapon X program,<ref>''Wolverine'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> the claws are later revealed to be a natural part of his body.<ref>''Wolverine'' (vol. 2) #75. Marvel Comics.</ref> The claws are not made of [[keratin]], as claws tend to be in the animal kingdom, but extremely dense bone. Wolverine's hands do not have openings for the claws to move through: they cut through his flesh every time he extrudes them, with occasional references implying that he feels a brief moment of slight pain in his hands when he unsheathes them.<ref>''Wolverine'' vol. 2, #77. Marvel Comics.</ref> During a talk to Jubilee, Wolverine reveals that there are channels inside his forearms through which the claws move when he extrudes them and that he unsheathes the claws a few times a day to keep the channels open, similar to pierced ears.<ref>''Wolverine'', #75. Marvel Comics</ref>\n\n[[File:Wolverine Weapon X Vol 1 1.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Cover art for ''Wolverine: Weapon X'' #1 (June 2009) by Ron Garney]]\nWolverine's senses of sight, smell, and hearing are all superhumanly acute. He can see with perfect clarity at greater distances than an ordinary human, even in near-total darkness. His hearing is enhanced in a similar manner, allowing him to hear sounds ordinary humans cannot and also hear to greater distances. A perfect example is him being able to hear the heartbeats of hostile living things before conflict begins.<ref>''Wolverine'' vol. 2, #31 Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nWolverine is able to use his sense of smell to easily remember and track targets by scent, even if the scent has been eroded somewhat over time by natural factors. This sense also allows him to identify [[shapeshifting]] mutants despite other forms they may take.<ref name=\"Wolverine 1992\">''Wolverine'' vol. 2, #51 (Feb. 1992). Marvel Comics.</ref> Through concentration, he is also able to use his senses of smell and hearing as a type of natural [[lie detector]], such as detecting a faint change in a person's heartbeat and scent due to perspiration when a lie is told.<ref>Claremont, Chris (w), [[Davis, Alan]] [[Farmer, Mark]] (i). \"Impediments\", ''The Uncanny X-Men'' #451 (December 2004). Marvel Comics.</ref><ref>''Wolverine: Origins'' #9 (Feb. 2007). Marvel Comics.</ref> Wolverine's sense of smell also allows him to detect danger from considerable distances, by being able to smell any weapons being carried by other living things and machines at least within a block radius. On one occasion, he is made aware of several yakuza members being outside the Princess bar he is in, by picking up the scent of their gun oil, the smell of their tattoo ink, and the smell of the [[daikon]] they ate before arriving.<ref>''Wolverine'' vol. 2, #31. Marvel Comics.</ref> On another occasion, his acute sense of smell even allows him to detect the presence of [[X-23]] sneaking around the outside grounds of Xavier Institute, by way of the wind shifting - despite him being indoors.<ref>''X-23: Target X'' #6. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nOn more than one occasion, Wolverine's entire skeleton, including his claws, has been molecularly infused with adamantium. Due to their coating, his claws can cut almost any known solid material, including most metals, wood, and some varieties of stone. The only known exceptions are adamantium itself and [[Captain America]]'s [[Captain America's shield|shield]], which is made out of a proto-adamantium-[[vibranium]] [[alloy]]. Vibranium alone is not comparable in terms of durability with adamantium and has been broken by [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]]. Wolverine's ability to slice completely through a substance depends upon both the amount of force he can exert and the thickness of the substance. His claws can also be used to block attacks or projectiles, as well as dig into surfaces allowing Wolverine to climb structures.<ref>''Wolverine'' (vol. 2) #91, #101</ref> The adamantium also adds weight to his blows, increasing the effectiveness of his offensive capabilities.<ref name=\"Wolverine vol.1 #2 October 1982\"/> However, his adamantium skeleton makes him highly susceptible to magnetic-based attacks.<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 2, #25 (Oct. 1993). Marvel Comics.</ref> The full extent of this is revealed during a battle with Magneto, where the latter destabilizes the adamantium on a molecular level, and proceeds to rip it from his body.<ref>''X-Men'' #25 (October 1993)</ref><ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' (vol. 1) #304 (1993)</ref> According to [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]], Wolverine would be unable to move without his enhanced strength due to the additional weight of the adamantium bonded to his skeleton.<ref>''Death of Wolverine'' vol.1 #1 (Nov. 2014).

His stamina is sufficiently heightened to the point that he can exert himself for numerous hours, even after exposure to powerful tranquilizers.<ref>''X-Men'' (vol. 2) #5. Marvel Comics.</ref> Wolverine's agility and reflexes are also enhanced to levels that are beyond the physical limits of the finest human athlete.<ref>''Wolverine: Origins'' #5.

Most significantly, Weapon X is missing a hand, cut off by Cyclops (who in turn is missing an eye thanks to Weapon X). The claws on this hand still exist, however, which appear by piercing through the metal stump covering the break. Consistent with the main characterization, this version is also shown to be a loner, his back story presenting him as an unwilling recruit to the X-Men. He and Jean Grey are lovers in this reality.<ref>''Weapon X'' #1-4</ref>\nAlso during the arc, there is a separate character named Wolverine, a mutant altered by Dark Beast, who worked as a tracker for Apocalypse.{{issue|date=June 2014}}\n\n====Weapon Omega====\nLater he offered himself to the Celestials to prevent the planet's judgment and was further augmented by the Celestial technology, yet while he had ascended in form and power, his mind had become so twisted to the point of assembling a deadly group of genetically modified warriors known as the Black Legion and sent them to kill Charles Lehnsherr, the infant son of Magneto and Rogue. He also captured his teammate [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] and renamed her as Orordius after using the Celestial technology on her, enslaving and transforming her into a blind seer made of living stone. He also intended to do the same to Jean Grey, by turning her into the Horseman of Death, but his efforts were prevented by the Uncanny X-Force from the Main Reality, who had traveled to the Age of Apocalypse seeking a celestial life seed.{{issue|date=February 2013}}\n\n===Age of X===\nIn the ''[[Age of X]]'' reality, Wolverine's powers have been virtually lost after he was forced to ingest a mutant 'cure' in order to dispose of it; although his healing factor can stop the cure totally affecting him, it is now so focused on fighting the cure and the adamantium poisoning of his metal skeleton that he cannot fight any more, as any additional strain placed on his system could kill him.<ref>''Age of X: Alpha'' #1</ref>\n\n===Amalgam Comics===\nIn the [[Amalgam Comics]] community, Wolverine was combined with [[Batman]] to create [[Dark Claw]].<ref>Legends of the Dark Claw #1 (1996)</ref><ref>Dark Claw Adventures #1 (1997)</ref>\n\n===Amazing Spider-Man: Renew Your Vows===\nIn the ''[[Amazing Spider-Man: Renew Your Vows]]'' timeline, Wolverine is married to Jean Grey and they are the co-directors of education at Xavier's school for Gifted Youngsters. They also have a daughter named Kate, who is nicknamed \"Shine.\"<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man: Renew Your Vows'' (vol. 2) #6</ref> In this timeline, the superhero Civil War was averted when Charles Xavier proposed self-policing among the super-powered community. The fallout of this decision tore apart Jean and Cyclops, leading to her marriage to Logan.\n\n===Civil War===\nIn the alternate version of ''Civil War'' seen in the ''Secret Wars'' event, Wolverine is on Captain America's side, as is also a grey version of the Hulk.<ref>''Civil War Vol 2'' #5</ref>\n\n===Counter-Earth===\nIn the ''Onslaught Reborn'' mini-series, the Wolverine of [[Counter-Earth (comics)|Counter-Earth]] is revealed to have been masquerading as that Earth's version of [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Hawkeye]].{{issue|date=February 2013}}\n\n===Days of Future Past===\nIn this alternate reality the [[X-Men]] fail to prevent the assassination of [[Robert Kelly (comics)|Senator Robert Kelly]], which results in [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinels]] ruling the [[United States|United States of America]] by 2013 AD. Mutants fall one by one at the hands of the Sentinels, until only Wolverine, Storm, Colossus and Kitty Pryde (Shadowcat) are left. They are confronted by a group of Sentinels and Wolverine lunges at one, ready to slice off the Sentinel's head, but his flesh is burned off by the Sentinel's hand laser. Wolverine seemingly dies and his charred Adamantium skeleton falls onto the ground. Later on in the Earth X: Heralds storyline, Wolverine is revived by X-51's machine.\n\n===Deadpool: Merc with a Mouth===\nIn the seventh issue of this series, Deadpool visits a universe where the wild west still exists.

This Clan, which is also dubbed wolf clan, were mortal enemies of the Bear Clan, to which Sabretooth belongs. Supposedly, it is this Moon Tribe child who was named James Howlett and would grow up to become Wolverine explaining the enmity between Wolverine and Sabretooth in this alternative reality.{{issue|date=February 2013}}\n\nIt is also revealed that this seemingly divergent sub-species is in fact what the \"true\" human species would have become if not for the Celestials' intervention and genetic tampering.{{issue|date=February 2013}}\n\nIn the ''Earth X'' series, Wolverine has married Jean Grey; however, they are now overweight and fit the image of a bickering couple. When the Skull attacks New York, Wolverine refuses to aid [[Captain America]] and the other heroes in fighting him. Jean, disgusted, leaves Logan, but not before claiming that she is in fact [[Madelyne Pryor]]. The two later reconcile, but have not gotten back together.{{issue|date=February 2013}}\n\n===Exiles and Weapon X===\nAnother version of Wolverine, originating from Earth-172, was revealed by Sabretooth to have joined an alternative, more sinister version of [[Weapon X (Exiles)|Weapon X]] in the [[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]] series. At some point in Weapon X's travels, this version of Wolverine was killed. Like other fallen members of the Exiles and Weapon X, his body was stored in a stasis wall inside the [[Timebreaker]]s' crystal palace before he was sent home to his own timeline to be cremated by his loved ones.{{issue|date=February 2013}}\n\nIssue #85 and #86 followed the adventures of several Wolverines from different timelines gathered in an attempt to stop a mutant known as [[Brother Mutant (comics)|Brother Mutant]], a being with the combined powers of Wolverine, Magneto, [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]], Scarlet Warlock (a male version of the [[Scarlet Witch]]) and [[Mesmero]]. Different teams of Wolverines were gathered and each fell to the hypnotic powers of Brother Mutant. The last team of Wolverines was composed of Patch, an alternative version of the zombie Wolverine featured in the miniseries [[Marvel Zombies]], [[Albert (comics)|Albert]] & [[Elsie-Dee]], Weapon X, a young James Howlett and the Days of Future Past Logan. When most of this team fell before Brother Mutant's followers, Logan and James Howlett were able to contact the [[Timebreaker]]s and convinced them to gather the original [[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]] to help defeat Brother Mutant.{{issue|date=February 2013}}\n\nNumerous other alternative reality versions of Wolverine appear in those issues as well, some of them being hybrids between Wolverine and main Marvel continuity characters (Thing/Wolverine, Hulk/Wolverine, Deadpool/Wolverine, etc.).{{issue|date=February 2013}}\n\nIssue #91-94 shows Wolverine as an agent of [[Hydra (Marvel Comics)|HYDRA]] which he leads together with the [[Invisible Woman]], with whom Logan has a relationship. They also appear in the following New Exiles series, where he is ultimately killed by an alternative version of [[Shadowcat]].{{issue|date=February 2013}}\n\n===Future Imperfect===\nIn the future of ''Future Imperfect'', where Earth was decimated by nuclear war and the Hulk had become the insane dictator known as the [[Maestro (comics)|Maestro]], the now-elderly [[Rick Jones (comics)#The Incredible Hulk: Future Imperfect|Rick Jones]] kept Wolverine's skeleton as one of the many mementoes of the age of heroes, his words implying that Wolverine was killed in the nuclear fallout of the two world wars between the present and his time. Rick was later killed when his attempt to defend himself from the Maestro with Captain America's shield caused him to be thrown out of his wheelchair and impaled on the skeleton's claws, the Maestro grimly commenting on the amusing irony of Rick being killed by one relic while defending himself with another.{{issue|date=February 2013}}\n\n===General James Howlett===\nFrom the \"Exalted\" storyline of ''Astonishing X-Men'' and ''[[X-Treme X-Men]]'' vol. 2, General Howlett was a general in the army of the [[British Empire]], and viceroy of his world's Canada. Howlett was part of an expedition to the lost city of [[Shangri-La]]. There, his skeleton was bonded with the adamantine. However, he was taken from his world by some means when the Saviour came calling. He was held for a time, but escaped with the help of Scott Summers. Now he is a member of a dimension-hopping X-Men team and assisted with hunting down ten evil [[Professor X|Xaviers]] from various alternative timelines in order to save the multiverse. He is in a relationship with his world's [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]]; however, their relationship is considered illicit because the gods of Olympus are not permitted to consort with mortals.{{issue|date=February 2013}}\n\n===Guardians of the Galaxy===\nIn the alternative future of the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (1969 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]], Wolverine's adamantium skeleton is reanimated and controlled by the brain of [[Doctor Doom]]. Additionally, one of the villains appearing in the series, in which Wolverine is still remembered with awe as \"the Brood Slayer\", is his great-great-granddaughter [[Rancor (comics)|Rancor]], who is obsessed with her ancestor and owns one of his broken off claws. Rancor comes to rule a human colony, which had been founded by Wolverine and other mutants, hundreds of years ago. She came from a long lineage, all claiming rulership by relation to Wolverine. Most were murderous tyrants.{{issue|date=February 2013}}\n\nIt is, however, hinted at that Wolverine is still alive. Alluded to by several \"shots\" of an unrevealed, shadowy individual, which included captions and character comments heightening the suggestion. The character is never revealed, leaving the question of who they were unanswered.{{issue|date=February 2013}}\n\nWhile it is a strongly held belief that he will live hundreds of years, this suggests Logan has the potential to live for thousands of years, but how it may fit into Marvel canon is unknown.{{issue|date=February 2013}}\n\n===Here Comes Tomorrow===\nIn the \"[[Here Comes Tomorrow]]\"story arc, set 150 years in an alternative future, Wolverine is still alive and part of group fighting against a version of [[Beast (Marvel Comics)|Beast]] possessed by [[Sublime (Marvel Comics)|Sublime]]. This version of Wolverine is killed when Beast artificially gives himself the powers of the [[Phoenix (comics)|Phoenix Force]] and turns off Wolverine's healing factor, before beating him to death. This future is averted by [[Jean Grey]].<ref>''New X-Men'' #151-154 (March\u2013May 2004)</ref>\n\n===The Hooded Man===\nThis version of Wolverine comes from hundreds of years into the future. He is part of a group called \"The Last Defenders\", who, led by a future version of [[Sue Storm]], have come back in time to save the last of humanity.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #559</ref> This future Logan later briefly encounters his younger self at the future Sue's funeral, telling him, \"Don't even ask.\"<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #562</ref>\n\nDuring the ''[[Fantastic Force]]'' mini-series, Logan briefly leads the team when they find themselves under attack from various enemies summoned by Gaea the living spirit of the Fantastic Force's now barren earth. Due to the abandonment of all life she has been driven insane and attempts to force them back in to their timeline. After several confrontations and fights, Logan elects to stay behind in the future and to aid Gaea in restoring herself by sharing his healing factor. The two are last seen tending to a garden with Gaea pregnant.<ref>''Fantastic Force'' #1-4</ref>\n\n===Hound===\nA Wolverine from an unidentified reality is called '''Hound''' and is shown to be the loyal pet of the unidentified Dark Phoenix and member of her Berserkers. They appeared as members of the Multiversal [[Masters of Evil]]. When the group was on Earth-616, Hound accompanied Dark Phoenix and [[King Killmonger]] in attacking Echo, Iron Man, and Thor at Asgard even when Dark Phoenix summoned a Berserker that is a Thor from an unidentified reality.<ref>''Avengers'' Vol. 8 #50-51. Marvel Comics.</ref> They retreated after the Berserker Thor was killed by Thor. The Multiversal Masters of Evil then left Earth-616 to get back to work.<ref>''Avengers'' Vol. 5 #54. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n===House of M===\nAlthough another reality, the Wolverine of [[House of M]] is the 616 Wolverine, retaining his memories from the old reality, including his untampered past. After the House falls, he retains these memories. The House of M Wolverine was a head operative of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'s Red Guard, and had an affair with [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]].{{issue|date=February 2013}}\n\n===Marvel Mangaverse===\nIn the [[Marvel Mangaverse]] reality Wolverine, not [[Professor X|Charles Xavier]], formed the X-Men (Wolverine, [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]], [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], [[Danielle Moonstar|Mirage]] and Jean Grey forming the core of the group, with [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] living with them).{{issue|date=February 2013}}\n\nWolverine has one set of long metal claws\u2014most likely adamantium and shaped like [[katana]]s on his left hand, and another set, on his right hand, composed of red energy (like Cyclops's optic beams) and shaped like [[lightsaber]]s. Wolverine has incredible strength. He has white hair (it is later changed to black in the new mangaverse) and a strange tattoo on his face, possibly meant to be the Greek symbol Omega.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} His uniform is highly reminiscent of that worn by ''[[Dragon Ball]]'' character [[Vegeta]], possibly as homage.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}\n\nIn this reality, he and Cyclops are brothers. Wolverine cost Cyclops one of his eyes, while it is hinted that Cyclops cost Wolverine one of his hands. (This seems to be why one of Wolverine's sets of claws is energy while the other is metal. Throughout this story with the exception of a pair of panels, Wolverine was depicted with two flesh and blood hands, but his right hand had claws of energy, not adamantium. The flesh and blood appearance of both hands continued in the final issue of the first arc of Mangaverse). He is also hinted to have had a relationship with Jean Grey, who had begun to favor Cyclops.{{issue|date=February 2013}}\n\nIn the New Mangaverse, Wolverine is one of the few mutants to survive the [[Hand (comics)|Hand]]/[[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] bio-engineered virus targeting mutants thanks to his healing factor. Jean Grey's rejection of him has clearly left him with some issues since he said he had a thing for redheads and flirts with [[Spider-woman]] ([[Mary Jane Watson]]) in ''New Mangaverse #2''. It is clear that his advances are unwanted and that Mary Jane is scared of him. When Logan grabs her, Spider-Man becomes angry and tries to fight him but proves to be no match for Wolverine and it is ultimately the [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]] that stops him. He flirts with the Black Cat throughout the New Mangaverse miniseries, saying \"I've always been a sucker for a girl with a nice set of&nbsp;... CLAWS.\" It is also hinted that at some point in the past he was [[Lady Deathstrike]]'s lover.{{issue|date=February 2013}}\n\nIn the New Mangaverse, Wolverine teams up with the Black Cat, [[Captain America]] ([[Carol Danvers]]), [[Iron Man]], Spider-Man, Spider-Woman (Mary Jane Watson), and The Torch (Jonatha Storm, [[Sue Storm|Sioux Storm]]'s half sister, this reality's [[Human Torch]]) to fight the Hand (some of the organization's more prominent members being Lady Deathstrike, [[Elektra (comics)|Elektra]], [[Silver Samurai]], [[Sunfire (comics)|Sunfire]], and a (brainwashed) [[Sharon Carter]]).{{issue|date=February 2013}}\n\n===Marvel Noir===\nIn ''X-Men Noir'', set in the [[Marvel Noir]] reality, '''\"Captain\" Logan''' is a heavily scarred bootlegger operating in the New York Chinatown and adept at defending himself with a metallic claw.<ref>''X-Men Noir'' #2\u20134 (January{{snd}}March 2009)</ref>\n\n''Wolverine Noir'', which presents a different characterization, presents '''Jim Logan''', private investigator along with [[Dog Logan]], whom he claims is his brother.<ref>''Wolverine Noir'' #1\u20134 (April{{snd}}July 2009)</ref>\n\n===Marvel Zombies===\nIn the alternative [[Marvel Zombies]] universe, Wolverine is one of many heroes who become infected by the zombie virus. He is actually infected when both zombies [[Captain America]], and [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Hawkeye]] bite him. The virus overwhelms his healing factor, so he can no longer heal from any injury. He, along with other zombies, attempted to slay the Silver Surfer. Wolverine attacks the Surfer but his body is decayed so much that his right arm is torn apart, as his adamantium bones are stronger than his rotting flesh. Eventually Wolverine and the other zombies are successful in killing and eating the Surfer. As a result, he and the others gain the Silver Surfer's cosmic power and wound and devour [[Galactus]], becoming the creatures collectively known as The Galacti.{{issue|date=February 2013}}\n\nThe Marvel Zombies attack a Skrull planet, only to encounter the [[Fantastic Four]] of the 616 reality - currently consisting of [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]], [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] and the [[Human Torch]], leaving the Zombies eager to capture the FF and transport back to their reality.<ref>''Black Panther'' #28-30 (July - September 2007)</ref>\n\nIn ''[[Marvel Zombies 2]]'', Wolverine's lost right arm has been replaced with a cybernetic arm with claws. He is loyal to [[Henry Pym]] (Giant-Man) and willingly attacks the defecting [[Spider-Man]]. When the others realize that the hunger is fading, he initially refuses to let go of a survivor in his grasp until Henry Pym tells him to stop, saying he seemingly loses his hunger.{{issue|date=February 2013}} He is one of the last surviving zombies from the zombie Hulk's attack that killed many zombies, and even the last zombies to especially kill the Hulk with his cosmic powers.{{issue|date=April 2013}}\n\nAfter that, he was teleported to a new world known as [[Marvel Zombies Return|Earth 91126]] along with the other surviving zombies. During the teleportation, he lost his cosmic powers, and became a regular zombie once more.{{issue|date=April 2013}}\n\nZombie Wolverine also appears in ''Marvel Zombies Return.'' In this Zombie Wolverine kills the human [[Elektra (comics)|Elektra]], [[Iron Fist (comics)]] and [[Shang-Chi]], [[White Tiger (comics)|White Tiger]], Black Tiger, and many of the [[Hand (comics)|Hand]], thus recently he was one of the few remaining zombies left.{{issue|date=February 2013}}\n\nHe also appears in Japan, and infects another version of himself, though he resists the hunger and angrily kills him, zombie Spider-Man watches the whole thing happen. This reality's Wolverine joined Spider-Man's New Avengers consisting of Spider-Man, [[War Machine|Iron Man (James Rhodes)]], [[Hulk]] and himself. He, along with the rest of the zombies are destroyed by the nanite-carried Sandman.{{issue|date=April 2013}}\n\n===MC2===\nIn the alternative future known as [[Marvel Comics 2|MC2]], Wolverine and [[Elektra (comics)|Elektra]] are married and have a daughter named Rina Logan, who inherits her father's healing factor and senses and possesses \"psychic claws\" which resemble [[Betsy Braddock|Psylocke]]'s telepathic \"psychic knife\". She becomes a superheroine called [[Wild Thing (comics)|Wild Thing]]. Wolverine also has a son, [[Sabreclaw|Sabreclaw (Hudson Logan)]], with another woman.{{issue|date=February 2013}}\n\nDuring the events of ''[[Last Hero Standing]]'', Wolverine is among the heroes kidnapped by Loki as part of his plan to bring about the end of the Age of Heroes.{{issue|date=February 2013}}\n\n===Mutant X===\nThis version of Wolverine is a member of the Pack a group consisting of Sabertooth, Wildchild and Logan. All three savage and driven insane by the Weapon X experiments. The three roam the Canadian wilderness very much like a wolf pack.{{issue|date=February 2013}}\n\n===Old Man Logan===\n{{main|Old Man Logan}}\nOld Man Logan is a character depicted in an eight-issue story arc in the ''[[Wolverine (comic book)|Wolverine]]'' [[ongoing series]] by writer [[Mark Millar]] and artist [[Steve McNiven]]. He debuted in ''Wolverine'' #66 in June 2008. Set over fifty years in the future on Earth-807128, the entire United States has been overtaken and divided amongst supervillains. Logan lives with his wife Maureen and young children Scotty and Jade on a barren plot of land in Sacramento, California, now part of the territory known as \"Hulkland.\" Logan needs money to pay rent to the landlords of this territory: the hillbilly grandchildren of the Hulk, who are products of years of incestuous procreation originating with Banner and his first cousin [[She-Hulk]]. In order to pay the rent, Logan accepts a job from a now-blind [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Hawkeye]]: help him navigate east across the country, to the capitol of New Babylon, and deliver a secret and illegal package.{{issue|date=February 2013}}\n\nThroughout the story it is said that Logan as \"Wolverine\" died the day the villains attacked and has refused to pop his claws since, even in a fight. Via flashbacks it is revealed that on the night the world's heroes came under attack by masses of villains, a group consisting of [[Mr. Sinister]], [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]], [[Doctor Octopus]], [[Omega Red]], [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]] and many others attacked the [[X-Mansion]]. Unable to locate his teammates, Wolverine was forced to slaughter the attackers to ensure the safety of the mutant children. As the last attacker was killed, Logan realized that the entire assault was an illusion created by [[Mysterio]], and his perceived enemies were actually his fellow [[X-Men]].

After they defeat him, Wolverine then says that this neighborhood is not his home anymore and gives Spider-Man his medal, which resembles the medal that Naoko's husband wears in the photo, confirming that Wolverine is Shayne's father and Naoko's ex-husband, despite the [[Spider-Man Unlimited]] animated series confirming that the [[Green Goblin]] of Counter-Earth is Naoko's ex-husband and Shayne's father, leaving the identity of Naoko's ex-husband and Shayne's father unknown.{{issue|date=February 2013}}\n\n===Ultimate Marvel===\n{{Further|Ultimate Wolverine}}\n\nUltimate Wolverine is the Wolverine in the [[Ultimate Marvel]] universe.

When the [[Punisher]], aided by [[Doctor Strange]]'s spirit, inadvertently kills [[Kitty Pryde]], Wolverine kills him, but also recovers his human side and, with the aid of Strange, puts an end to all vampires in New York, including himself, by reciting the [[Darkhold|Montesi Formula]].{{issue|date=February 2013}}\n*Issue #37, ''Wolverine had been Lord of the Vampires during Inferno?'' - A sequel of sorts to issue 24, the story diverges once more, with Logan killing the Punisher before he can stop the vampires.

Finally Roma magically turns Hulk back into Banner, but by that time most of the heroes are already dead.{{issue|date=February 2013}}\n*Issue #62, ''Wolverine fights Weapon X?'' - In this timeline, a drunken and dejected Wolverine was never kidnapped and enhanced in the Weapon X program. Instead, a Canadian Marine was selected but the program left him an insane, uncontrollable killing machine who escapes and kills numerous police and federal agents as well as civilians - pretty much anyone in his path. One of the mounties killed is a friend of Logan's, however, so he offers his services to stop Weapon X. Using an arsenal of weaponry and instinct, Logan disarms and finally kills the rampaging Weapon X before escaping into the woods and later blowing the whole cover on Department H and the Weapon program.{{issue|date=February 2013}}\n*Issue #93, ''What if Wolverine became savage?'' - After the failed attempt by Genesis to put the adamantium back into Wolverine, our hero goes completely berserk and slaughters Genesis and all of his lackeys.

Unfortunately, Wolverine is the best at what he does, so he promptly kills Apocalypse and every other super-villain in the Marvel universe before working his way down to any criminal he can find. When the world's superheroes and law enforcement agencies try to stop the murderous War, he turns his attention to them as well - eventually eradicating all of the heroes too. Hundreds of years later, the planetary infrastructure that was set up to protect people from the Horseman of War has made the planet an idyllic paradise. Wolverine, now free again from Apocalypse's programming, lives as a monk named Brother Xavier and teaches the young the dangers of violence and War.<ref>''What If?'' (vol. 2) #111</ref>\n\nIn a recent ''What If?'' issue, Logan was present when [[Daken]] was born and was able to save him from the people who would have raised him in the original course of events, taking him to live in seclusion in the mountains in the hope that he could raise Daken away from the kind of life he has lived himself. However, despite his attempts to ensure privacy by turning Professor X away when he came to recruit Logan to join the X-Men, Logan's attempts to suppress Daken's darker instincts failed when Sabretooth found them, revealing the truth about his father's past to Daken. Leaving his father, Daken became a brutal killer, roaming various cities and killing his opponents, proclaiming that Logan made him what he is by denying him his heritage. Concluding that he will never bring anything good into the world, Logan stabs Daken in the heart with the Muramasa Blade, subsequently impaling himself to end his own dark stain on the world.{{issue|date=February 2013}}\n\n===Wolverine MAX===\nWolverine is a lone survivor of a fatal plane crash.

In the flashbacks, he was a man on his way to the West to find peace within himself. He is also approached by Victor who claims he is the same as Logan and they do not have to be alone anymore.<ref>''Wolverine: Max'' #1</ref> Logan finds a lead leading him to a restaurant in the Roppongi district of Tokyo. He finds out he goes by another alias named Collinsworth. The mysterious woman's name turns out to be Yami. It also seems that he has numerous apartments and buildings in Tokyo as well.

As he takes the subway, there is a flashback when a woman approaches him and makes conversation. Turns out Logan is a monk and is Canadian. She asks him to walk her home. Her name is [[Mariko Yashida]]. After she leaves, Victor approaches him jokes about how Logan is coming out of his shell and is acting like the Logan he heard about back in Canada. Victor then explains to him that outside of the monastery the country is in chaos. He also explains that guys like him and Logan are in demand because there are no others like them. Victor is working for the Machi-Yako which are helping the Shogunate Clan in their war against the Yashida Clan who, according to him, are rapists and killers. Victors employers are paying him in gold not rice, He attempts to persuade Logan by stating that he will need gold to win over a woman like Mariko. Back in the present, Logan is watching television when the news anchor states that Yami boarded the plane with John Grant, Logan's alias. Logan starts trying to find out why Yami was on the plane. He walks into a bar trying to get some information, only to end up in a bar fight. After some heavy persuasion, he finds out where Yami's family lives. In another flashback, Logan takes up Victor's offer. The two participate in the ongoing feud of the Shogunate and Yashida clans. Victor states that Shingen is hiding in a monastery.

Logan explains that he was on the plane with her. Yami's father asks did she die in pain. Logan lies and says it was quick. The father warns Logan to leave the city before it is too late. At this point it is revealed that Logan's flashbacks go back to 150 years ago. As Logan is walking, a citizen warns Logan to run, because he is coming. Logan asks who, and the citizen lifts up his head only to show a grotesque face with his eye hanging out of the socket. The victim answers Logan with \"Creed\".<ref>''Wolverine: MAX'' #2</ref>\n\nIt is also officially in the same continuity as ''[[Punisher MAX]]'', ''Foolkiller MAX'', the MAX ''Fury'' titles and ''Phantom Eagle MAX'' as evidenced in one issue where Wolverine got his adamantium claws from a Las Vegas gangster. Other major differences with this Wolverine from his main Marvel Universe counterpart are that his adamantium claws were from Mickey Gold a Las Vegas gangster instead of his skeleton coated in the material or bone claws and that he became a samurai and monk in the 1860s in feudal-era Japan when meeting Mariko Yashida.\n\n===Wolverine: Prodigal Son===\nAnother alternative reality, in which Logan is a rebellious youth taken in by a dojo in a secluded forest when he was found near dead with [[amnesia]].
