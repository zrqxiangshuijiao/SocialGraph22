He became responsible for his younger siblings when his mother Emma Johnson Farrell became ill. Robert was a scientific prodigy, and when he realized he could not earn enough to support his family, he turned to a life of crime as the Rocket Racer. He developed a super-powered skateboard which is propelled at great speed by small rockets and cybernetically controlled by a crude [[walkman]]-like device. He wore a weapon-equipped costume, including rocket-powered gloves which give him the ability to hit an opponent with a \"rocket-powered-punch.\"\n\nEarly in his career as a burglar, Rocket Racer encounters [[Spider-Man]].<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #172</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Cowsill |first1=Alan |last2=Manning |first2=Matthew K. |title=Spider-Man Chronicle: Celebrating 50 Years of Web-Slinging |date=2012 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-0756692360 |page=96}}</ref>\n\nRocket Racer hires the [[Tinkerer (Marvel Comics)|Tinkerer]] to redesign his skateboard after his first defeat by Spider-Man. At one point, he is hired by Jackson Weele to steal evidence that might be incriminating. Robert uses the evidence to blackmail Weele who wishes to commit suicide but Robert stops this. Even then, though, he mocks Weele as Big Weele. This is enough for Jackson to hire the Tinkerer to create a literal [[Big Wheel (comics)|Big Wheel]], to chase Robert around town with. Spider-Man assists and Weele seemingly falls to death in the Hudson River.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #182-183</ref> Later, Rocket Racer was saved by Spider-Man from the Bounty Hunter.<ref>''Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man'' #104</ref>\n\nRepeated defeats at the hands of Spider-Man and several brushes with the law, including a short jail sentence, convince Robert to reform. He goes through a high school equivalency course and his extremely high marks gain him a scholarship to Empire State University<ref>''Web of Spider-Man'' #56</ref>.<ref name=\"mnyc\">{{cite book  | last = Sanderson  | first = Peter  | title = The Marvel Comics Guide to New York City  | publisher = [[Pocket Books]]  | year = 2007  | location = New York City  | pages = 30\u201333  | isbn = 978-1-4165-3141-8}}</ref> This does not go well as his first few days are full with combating the efforts of a hate-group on campus. Though assisted by Spider-Man and sometimes, by other students who oppose the racism, Robert still struggles with his own rage during the entire ordeal.<ref>''Web of Spider-Man'' #57</ref>\n\nLater, Robert attempted to prove Spider-Man innocent of a crime; and first encountered [[Silver Sable]] and [[The Outlaws (comics)|The Outlaws]].<ref>''Web of Spider-Man'' #50</ref> He joined forces with Spider-Man to stop the white supremacist, Skinhead.

After being framed for a crime he did not commit however, Farrell is pursued by Spider-Man before they are both attacked by Weele.
