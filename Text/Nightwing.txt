The character has appeared in various incarnations; the identity was adopted by '''[[Dick Grayson]]''' when he left his role as [[Batman]]'s vigilante partner [[Robin (character)|Robin]].\n\nAlthough Nightwing is commonly associated with Batman, the title and concept have origins in classic [[Superman]] stories. The original Nightwing in DC Comics was an identity assumed by alien superhero Superman when stranded on the [[Krypton (comics)|Kryptonian]] city of [[Kandor (comics)|Kandor]] with his friend [[Jimmy Olsen]]. Drawing inspiration from Batman and Robin, the two protect Kandor as the superheroes Nightwing and [[Flamebird]]. Following the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' continuity reboot in 1985, Nightwing was re-imagined as a legendary vigilante from Krypton whose story inspires Dick Grayson's choice of name when he leaves behind his Robin identity.\n\nOther stories set among the ''Batman'' family of characters have seen acquaintances and friends of Grayson briefly assume the title, including his fellow Robin alumnus [[Jason Todd]]. Meanwhile, ''Superman'' stories have seen Superman's adopted son [[Chris Kent (comics)|Chris Kent]] and [[Power Girl]] take up the name for brief turns as Nightwing. Various other characters have taken the name in stories set outside DC's main continuity as well.\n\nIn 2013, Nightwing placed 5th on IGN's Top 25 Heroes of DC Comics<ref>{{cite web|last=Schedeen |first=Jesse |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/19/the-top-25-heroes-of-dc-comics |title=The Top 25 Heroes of DC Comics |publisher=IGN |date=2013-11-19 |access-date=2014-05-13}}</ref> and Grayson as Nightwing was ranked the #1 Sexiest Male Character in Comics by [[ComicsAlliance]] in 2013.<ref>{{cite web|last=Wheeler |first=Andrew |url=http://comicsalliance.com/comics-sexiest-male-characters |title=ComicsAlliance Presents The 50 Sexiest Male Characters in Comics |publisher=[[ComicsAlliance]] |date=2013-02-14 |access-date=2015-07-28 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151018024021/http://comicsalliance.com/comics-sexiest-male-characters |archive-date=2015-10-18 }}</ref>\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n\n===Pre-Crisis Era===\n\n====Superman====\n[[File:Superman v1 158.png|thumb|Superman and Jimmy as Nightwing and Flamebird respectively. From ''Superman'' #158 (1963). Art by [[Curt Swan]].]]\nNightwing is first depicted in the story \"Superman in Kandor\" in ''[[Superman (comic book)|Superman]]'' #158 (January 1963). It is an alias used by [[Superman]] in pre-[[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Crisis]] stories. The story is set in [[Kandor (comics)|Kandor]], a [[Krypton (comics)|Kryptonian]] city that was shrunken and preserved in a bottle by [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]]. In Kandor, Superman has no [[Superpower (ability)|superpowers]], and is branded an outlaw there due to a misunderstanding.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Fleisher |first1=Michael L. |title=The Original Encyclopedia of Comic Book Heroes, Volume Three: Superman |date=2007 |publisher=DC Comics |isbn=978-1-4012-1389-3 |page=250}}</ref>\n\nTo disguise themselves, Superman and [[Jimmy Olsen]] create vigilante identities inspired by [[Batman]] and [[Robin (comics)|Robin]]. Because neither bats nor robins lived on Krypton, Superman chooses the names of two birds owned by his Kandorian friend Nor-Kan: Nightwing for himself, and Flamebird for Jimmy. Nightwing and Flamebird rename Nor-Kan's underground laboratory as the \"Nightcave\", and use it as their secret headquarters. They also convert Nor-Kan's automobile into their \"Nightmobile\", and use \"jet-belts\" to fly into battle.\n\nIn ''Superman's Pal, Jimmy Olsen'' #69 (June 1963), \"The Dynamic Duo of Kandor\" introduces Nightwing's dog [[Nighthound]]. In \"The Feud Between Batman and Superman\" in ''[[World's Finest Comics|World's Finest]]'' #143 (August 1964), Batman and Robin themselves visit Kandor with Superman and Olsen and the two Dynamic Duos team up.\n\n====Van-Zee====\nIn ''[[Superman Family]]'' #183 (May/June 1977), Superman's [[look-alike]] second cousin Van-Zee and his niece's husband Ak-Var take up the Nightwing and Flamebird identities.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Eury |first1=Michael |title=The Krypton Companion |date=2006 |publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing |isbn=9781893905610 |page=31}}</ref> The vigilantes take on crime in their city as had Superman and Olsen before them.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Greenberger |first1=Robert |last2=Pasko |first2=Martin |title=The Essential Superman Encyclopedia |date=2010 |publisher=Del Rey |isbn=978-0-345-50108-0 |page=459}}</ref>\n\n====Dick Grayson====\n[[File:Nightwing v1 1.jpg|thumb|upright|Cover of ''Nightwing'' #1 (September 1995). Art by Brian Stelfreeze.]]\nAfter [[Dick Grayson]] gives up his Robin mantle, he wonders for a while about his new role. When the Titans are threatened with a new foe, he takes on the mantle of Nightwing, in a homage to the Graysons, Batman, and Superman.<ref>''Tales of the Teen Titans'' #44 (July 1984)</ref> This is the storyline that also introduces Slade Wilson A.K.A. Deathstroke the Terminator.\n\n===Post-Crisis===\n\n====Kryptonian mythological figure====\nPost-Crisis, there is a different originator of the Nightwing identity. Several hundred years before the birth of [[Kal-El]], there was a Kryptonian man who was cast out from his family and decided to take on crime as the vigilante Nightwing.<ref>''Secret Files and Origins'' #1 (October 1999)</ref> When Superman tells Dick Grayson of this story, Dick takes the name for himself.\n\n====Dick Grayson====\n{{Main|Dick Grayson}}\n\n[[Fictional history of Dick Grayson#Post-Crisis|Dick Grayson became Nightwing]] after Batman fired him from his own mantle of Robin for getting shot by Joker. Grayson's Flamebird was [[Bette Kane]]. After The New Teen Titans, Nightwing teamed up with old friend Speedy in Action Comics #613-618 & #627-634 later collected in New Friends Old Enemies. He featured in his own solo ''Nightwing'' series from 1995 to 2009; after Wayne's [[comic book death|apparent death]], Dick became the new Batman, retiring his Nightwing mantle temporarily.\n\nGrayson's Nightwing costume was a high-tech suit specially designed for his high-flying [[acrobatics|acrobatic]] style. His gauntlets and boots each contained eight compartments in which he could store items. They had a self-destruct feature built into them, similar to the ones in [[Batman's utility belt]], and, as another security measure, the suit contained a one-use-only [[taser]] charge, which automatically emitted a high-voltage electrical shock when someone attempted to tamper with either the boots or gauntlets.\n\nEach gauntlet's sections could contain a wide array of equipment, such as sonic or smoke pellets, modified [[batarang]]s (\"Wing-Dings\"), knockout gas capsules, throwable tracers, and a sedative-tipped dart launcher. The right gauntlet was also equipped with a 100,000-volt [[Electroshock weapon|stun gun]]. Like the gauntlets, his boot compartments could carry vital equipment such as [[flares]], a [[rebreather]] as protection against any airborne non-contact toxins, a mini-computer equipped with [[fax]], [[modem]], [[GPS]], and a minidisk re-writable drive. Other items were [[Lock picking|lock picks]], a [[first-aid kit]], a mini-[[cellphone]], flexi-cuffs, [[antitoxin]] assortment, wireless listening devices, and a small flashlight. After coming to New York, Dick added a black utility belt to his costume, eliminating the need for his boots and gauntlets.\n\nHeld in spring-loaded pouches in the back of his costume, Dick carried a pair of [[eskrima]] [[Club (weapon)|clubs]] made from an unbreakable polymer that were wielded as both offensive and defensive weapons. Some depictions display these tools with the mechanism to shoot a grappling hook attached to a swing line, while, in other instances, they can act as \"line guns\" similar to the ones Batman uses. The clubs could also be thrown with such skill by Grayson (and possibly due to their design) that they would ricochet off walls and objects to hit multiple targets, then return to his hands. These clubs also have the capability to be linked together as well as grow in size to make a staff, as depicted in many series, such as ''[[Teen Titans (TV series)|Teen Titans]]'' and ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]'' (Robin uses these weapons).\n\n====Superman====\nIn 2001's ''[[Superman: The Man of Steel]]'' #111, Superman and [[Lois Lane]] travel to a [[Krypton (comics)#Revisiting Krypton|version of Krypton]] later revealed to have been created by the villainous [[Brainiac 13]] and based on Jor-El's favorite period in Kryptonian history.<ref name=\"action793\">{{Cite comic\n | writer = [[Joe Kelly (comics)|Kelly, Joe]]\n | penciller = [[Pasqual Ferry|Ferry, Pascual]]<!--spelled \"Pascual\" in comic's credits-->\n | inker = [[Cam Smith|Smith, Cam]]\n | story = Return to Krypton II, Part Four: Dream's End\n | title = [[Action Comics]]\n | issue = #793\n | date = September 2002\n | publisher = DC Comics\n | location = New York\n | page = 20\n }}</ref> Labeled as criminals, Superman and Lois become fugitives, adopting the Nightwing and Flamebird identities to survive, just as had Superman and Olsen in ''Superman'' (vol. 2) #158.<ref name=\"mos111\">{{Cite comic\n | writer = [[Mark Schultz (comics)|Schultz, Mark]]\n | penciller = [[Doug Mahnke|Mahnke, Doug]]\n | inker = Nguyen, Tom\n | story = Return to Krypton Part Three: The Most Dangerous Kryptonian Game\n | title = [[Superman: The Man of Steel]]\n | issue = #111\n | date = April 2001\n | publisher = DC Comics\n | location = New York\n }}</ref>\n\n====Tad Ryerstad====\nIn [[Bl\u00fcdhaven]], a sociopath named [[Nite-Wing|Tad Ryerstad]] becomes a superhero, inspired by the retired hero [[Tarantula (DC Comics)|Tarantula]]. He takes his name, \"Nite-Wing\", from an all-night deli specializing in chicken wings. Unstable, Nite-Wing beats people for minor offenses. Nite-Wing is shot on his first night out and Dick Grayson, as Bl\u00fcdhaven's protector Nightwing, defends him from [[Blockbuster (DC Comics)#Roland Desmond|Blockbuster]]'s gang, who think it is Nightwing who has been injured. After Nite-Wing is released from the hospital, he kills the gang who put him there. Not realizing how violent Ryerstad is, Grayson agrees to train him. The two attack Blockbuster's organization, but are captured and separated. After an undercover [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agent frees Nite-Wing, Ryerstad beats him to death, and when Grayson realizes what he has done, Ryerstad flees.<ref>''[[Birds of Prey (comics)|Birds of Prey]]'' #20</ref> Nightwing subsequently tracks down and has Nite-Wing arrested by the police.<ref>''Nightwing'' (vol. 2) #47</ref> In prison, Ryerstad is cell-mates with [[Torque (DC Comics)|Torque]] (Dudley Soames), but the two escape by drugging the prison guard [[Amygdala (comics)|Amygdala]].\n\n====Jason Todd====\n{{Main|Jason Todd}}\n''Nightwing'' (vol. 2) #118-122<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.dccomics.com/dcu/comics/?cm=6772 | title=Nightwing: Brothers in Blood | publisher=DC Comics | access-date=September 14, 2010}}</ref> run features [[Jason Todd]] wearing Dick's costume and killing in New York City which led to a police manhunt against Nightwing.\n\n====Cheyenne Freemont====\nThe \"[[One Year Later]]\" storyline features a [[metahuman]] fashion designer named '''Cheyenne Freemont''' donning a modified Nightwing costume to help Grayson.<ref>''Nightwing'' (vol. 2) #118</ref>\n\nCheyenne first met Dick when they had a one-night stand together. They only exchanged first names the next morning, Cheyenne stating she's superstitious. The two had breakfast together and then he left. When he left another man walked into her apartment. When he assaulted her, she hit him with a telekinetic blast.\n\nDick found out Cheyenne was a fashion designer from a friend of his from [[Bludhaven]]. She ran into Dick again after he accidentally became a model for her. After seeing newspaper clippings of Nightwing (Jason Todd) she started creating superhero themed designs. Cheyenne wore a Nightwing costume to help Dick and Jason from a metahuman monster named Jakob. He ate her, but she used her powers to blow him up from the inside. Due to recent events she was left broke and soon left [[New York City]].<ref>''Nightwing'' (vol. 2) #123</ref>\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Nightwing Kandor.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Power Girl]] as Nightwing. Art by [[Ed Benes]].]] -->\n\n====Power Girl====\nIn ''[[Supergirl (comic book)|Supergirl]]'' (vol. 5) #6 (April 2006), [[Power Girl]] and Supergirl assume the identities of Nightwing and Flamebird in a story set in Kandor, just as in the original pre-Crisis stories featuring Superman.\n\n====Chris Kent====\n{{Main|Chris Kent (character)}}\n\nChris Kent, son of [[General Zod]], was Nightwing during ''[[Superman: New Krypton]]''. In that storyline, Superman was coming to terms with the death of his adoptive father; he was also dealing with 100,000 Kryptonians now living on Earth, which he had released from the bottled cities on [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]]'s ship (the same ship that contained the lost Kryptonian city of Kandor). At the end of the fourth issue of the arc, a new Nightwing and Flamebird appear in Superman's [[Fortress of Solitude]] to stop two of Zod's followers (who were living in Kandor) from releasing the Kryptonian General from his [[Phantom Zone]] imprisonment. While guarding the projector in order to prevent any Zod loyalists from freeing him from the Phantom Zone, both Flamebird and Nightwing exhibit powers that are not inherent to normal Kryptonians. Flamebird projects flames from her hands, and Nightwing uses \"natural tactile [[telekinesis]]\".\n\nThe pair seems to be stronger than normal Kryptonians: they knock out the two Zod loyalists with one blow apiece. In a later appearance, the duo is seen in [[Gotham City]]. Unlike previous portrayals, it seems Flamebird believes herself to be the dominant partner. When the Kryptonians led by Zod and Alura flee to a new Krypton orbiting the Sun, Nightwing and Flamebird stay in Gotham. In ''Action Comics'' #875, that Nightwing is revealed as the son of Zod and Ursa, [[Chris Kent (comics)|Chris Kent]]. The \"Nightwing\" identity is revealed to be based on a mythical Kryptonian creature, whose existence is intertwined with that of its partner beast, the Flamebird. Inside the [[Phantom Zone]] Chris' mind interfaced with a piece of [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]] technology, awakening a long-dormant connection to the Nightwing, and linking his mind to that of [[Thara Ak-Var]], who had a connection to the Flamebird.<ref>''Action Comics'' Annual #12</ref>\n\n==Alternative versions==\n* [[Batman (Terry McGinnis)|Terry McGinnis]] briefly moonlights as Nightwing in ''[[Batman Beyond (comics)|Batman Beyond]]'' #4, after Detective Ben Singleton claims to know Dick Grayson's past as Nightwing, which turns into a media fiasco.\n\n==Other uses in DC comics==\n* In the DC Comics [[Tangent Comics]] series, \"Nightwing\" is a secret government organization which appears throughout the series. Headed by Marcus Moore and Francis \"[[Black Lightning]]\" Powell, who act to protect the US and also conceal the true nature of [[The Atom]]'s involvement in the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]].\n\n==Ongoing series==\n\n===Story arcs===\n\nBased on Nightwing's increasing popularity, DC Comics decided to test the character's possibilities with a one-shot book and then a miniseries.\n\nFirst, in ''Nightwing: Alfred's Return'' #1 (1995), Grayson travels to [[England]] to find [[Alfred Pennyworth|Alfred]], who resigns from Bruce Wayne's service following the events of ''KnightSaga''. Before returning to Gotham City together, they prevent a plot by British [[terrorist]]s to destroy the undersea \"[[Channel Tunnel]]\" in the [[English Channel]].\n\nLater on, with the ''Nightwing'' miniseries (September 1995 to December 1995, written by [[Dennis O'Neil]] with [[Greg Land]] as artist), Dick briefly considers retiring from being Nightwing forever before family papers uncovered by Alfred reveal a possible link between the murder of the [[Flying Graysons]] and the Crown Prince of Kravia. Journeying to Kravia, Nightwing (in his third costume) helps to topple the murderous Kravian leader and prevent an ethnic cleansing, while learning his parents' true connection to the Prince.\n\n====Bl\u00fcdhaven====\nIn 1996, following the success of the miniseries, DC Comics launched a monthly solo series featuring Nightwing (written by [[Chuck Dixon]], with art by [[Scott McDaniel]]), in which he patrols Gotham's neighboring municipality of [[Bl\u00fcdhaven]].\n\nAt Batman's request, Dick journeys to this former whaling town-turned-industrial center to investigate a number of murders linked to Gotham City gangster [[Black Mask (comics)|Black Mask]]. Instead, he finds a city racked by police corruption and in the grips of organized crime consolidated by Roland Desmond, the gargantuan genius [[Blockbuster (DC Comics)#Roland Desmond|Blockbuster]].\n\nWith a defenseless city to call his own, Nightwing decides to remain in Bl\u00fcdhaven until Blockbuster's cartel is broken. This allows him to be close enough to Gotham to still be part of the [[Batman family]], and far enough as well to have his own city, adventures and enemies. He takes a job as a bartender to keep his ear to the ground and worked closely with Oracle (Barbara Gordon) in an effort to clean up the town. Blockbuster places a sizable contract on Nightwing's head shortly thereafter, while Grayson plies the unscrupulous Bl\u00fcdhaven Police Inspector [[Torque (DC Comics)|Dudley Soames]] for information on the kingpin's dealings. Also during his time in Bl\u00fcdhaven, Nightwing helps train a violent but enthusiastic street fighter called Nite-wing, who later kills an undercover FBI agent.\n\n====''Last Laugh'' and killing the Joker====\nWhen the Joker is told he is dying by his doctor, he unleashes Joker juice on the inmates at the Slab, causing a breakout. At the end of the arc, Joker tries to kill Tim Drake. When Nightwing finds them, Joker gloats that he has killed this Robin and the other one. In rage and despair, Nightwing (who thinks Tim is dead) beats Joker to death. However, Batman manages to revive the Joker.\n\n====Leader of the League====\nSometime after \"No Man's Land\" ends, the JLA disappears on a mission to locate [[Aquaman]] and Atlantis (The Obsidian Age). Before they vanish, Batman instigates a contingency plan, in which a handful of heroes would be assembled to create a new JLA, consisting of Nightwing, [[Green Arrow]], [[Ray Palmer (comics)|the Atom]], [[Kendra Saunders|Hawkgirl]], [[Major Disaster]], [[Faith (comics)|Faith]], [[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]] and [[Etrigan the Demon|Jason Blood]]. Nightwing is chosen to be leader until the original JLA are found, leading the group against the powerful Atlantean sorceress [[Gamemnae]] and helping to revive Aquaman to ask for his help in sinking Atlantis, but subsequently returns to the reserve list.\n\n====''Graduation Day''====\nFor several years, Nightwing leads various incarnations of the Titans and becomes the most respected former sidekick in the DC Universe. However, in the ''[[Titans/Young Justice: Graduation Day]]'' [[fictional crossover|crossover]], a rogue [[Superman]] android kills [[Lilith (DC Comics)|Lilith]] and [[Donna Troy|Troia]], an event that tears apart both Young Justice and the Titans. At Troia's funeral, Dick declares he is tired of seeing friends die and disbands the team, officially ending the Titans. A few months later, Arsenal persuades Nightwing to join a new pro-active crime-fighting team: the [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]], who would hunt villains, acting as co-workers rather than an extended family. He reluctantly accepts.\n\n====Death of Blockbuster====\nDick plays a key role in exposing the corruption in the Bl\u00fcdhaven Police Department. Despite reaching his original goals, Dick continues as a police officer during the day while spending nights as Nightwing, pushing himself to his limits and straining his relationships. The line between his police work and his [[vigilantism]] began to blur, and ultimately Amy Rohrbach (his friend and superior officer, who knew his secret identity) fires him rather than let him continue using questionable methods.\n\nWrongfully blaming Nightwing for the death of his mother, the mob boss Blockbuster bombs Dick Grayson's apartment complex and promises to kill anyone in Dick's life. When the vigilante [[Catalina Flores|Tarantula]] arrives, Nightwing chooses not to stop her when she shoots the villain dead.<ref>''Nightwing'' (vol. 2) #93</ref> He enters in a catatonic state after this action, and Tarantula takes advantage of his emotional trauma to rape him. At length, Nightwing shakes himself from his depression and takes responsibility for his inaction. He captures Tarantula and turns her and himself in to the police. Amy, however, feels the world needs Nightwing free and so prevents him from being charged.\n\nDick has destroyed the police corruption and removed the greater part of organized crime from this city, but his role in Blockbuster's death is still a source of tremendous guilt for him. He retires from crime fighting, with Tim Drake and [[Cassandra Cain]] as his replacements.\n\nGrayson moves to New York, where he works closely with the Outsiders. After \"insiders\" threaten both the Outsiders and the newest incarnation of Teen Titans, however, Nightwing realizes that the team has gotten \"too personal\" and quits.\n\n====''Infinite Crisis'' and ''52''====\nDue to a crisis of conscience, Dick adopts the new villainous persona of [[Renegade (DC Comics)|Renegade]] in order to infiltrate [[Lex Luthor]]'s [[Secret Society of Super-Villains]]. This ruse includes Nightwing aligning himself with his long-time enemy [[Deathstroke]] in order to track the manufacturing and distribution of Bane's venom serum and to keep tabs on the Society's activities in Gotham and [[Bl\u00fcdhaven]]. He also begins training (and subtly converting) Deathstroke's daughter, [[Rose Wilson|Ravager]].\n\nDeathstroke takes revenge on Nightwing when Bl\u00fcdhaven is destroyed by the Society. The Society drops the super villain [[Chemo (comics)|Chemo]] on the city, killing 100,000 people. Dick tries to rescue survivors but is overcome by radiation poisoning; only to be rescued himself by [[Batman]]. Nightwing confides that he let [[Blockbuster (DC Comics)|Blockbuster]] die and asks Batman to forgive him. Batman tells him that his forgiveness doesn't matter; Dick has to move beyond Blockbuster's death. Inspired by his mentor, he proposes to Barbara Gordon, who accepts his proposal with a kiss.\n\nBatman then entrusts Nightwing to alert other heroes about the danger that the Crisis poses. Dick flies to [[Titans Tower]], but due to the chaos resulting from the Bl\u00fcdhaven disaster, the [[OMAC (comics)|OMAC]] onslaught and other Crisis related events, the only hero who answers his call is [[Superboy (Kon-El)|Conner Kent]]. Together, they locate and attack [[Alexander Luthor, Jr.|Alexander Luthor]]'s tower, the center of the Crisis, only to be repelled by [[Superboy-Prime]]. Prime is ready to kill Nightwing when Conner intervenes, sacrificing himself to destroy the tower, ending the destruction of the Universe.\n\nDuring the [[Battle of Metropolis]], Nightwing suffers a near-fatal injury from Alexander Luthor when he attempts to save Batman's life. Originally, the editors at DC intended to have Dick Grayson killed in ''Infinite Crisis'' as ''[[Newsarama]]'' revealed from the DC Panel at WizardWorld Philiadelphia:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsarama.com/WWPhilly06/DC/DCUPanel.html |title=WizardWorld Philadelphia: DCU panel |access-date=14 October 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070623103614/http://www.newsarama.com/WWPhilly06/DC/DCUPanel.html |archive-date=June 23, 2007 }}</ref>\n\n{{cquote|It was again explained that Nightwing was originally intended to die in ''Infinite Crisis'', and that you can see the arc that was supposed to end with his tragic death in the series. After long discussions, the death edict was finally reversed, but the decision was made that, if they were going to be keeping him, he would have to be changed. The next arc of the ongoing series will further explain the changes, it was said.}}\n\nSaved by the Justice Society, Nightwing recovers with Barbara at his side. As soon as he's able to walk again, Batman asks him to join him and Robin in retracing Bruce's original journey in becoming the Dark Knight. While Nightwing is hesitant, due to his engagement with Barbara, she encourages him to go and returns his engagement ring so he can make an honest decision for himself. Barbara feels that it is important he rediscover himself, and until he does they're not yet ready to be married. They part on good terms, though before he departs Dick leaves her an envelope containing a photograph of them as Robin and Batgirl, along with the engagement ring on a chain and a note promising he'll come back to her one day.<ref>''Nightwing'' Annual #2</ref>\n\nSoon after his journey with Batman and Robin ends, Nightwing returns to Gotham, following Intergang's trail. He works with the new [[Batwoman]] and [[Renee Montoya]] to stop Intergang from destroying Gotham, shutting off dozens of fire-spewing devices spread across the city.\n\n====\"One Year Later\"====\n{{Main|One Year Later}}\nOne year later, Dick Grayson returns to [[New York City]] (his previous home base with the Teen Titans) in order to find out who has been masquerading as Nightwing. The murderous impostor turns out to be the former [[Robin (comics)|Robin]], [[Jason Todd]]. Grayson leads the [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]] once again, operating undercover and globally.\n\nNightwing follows an armored thief named Raptor, whom he suspects is responsible for series of murders. Later, Raptor himself is murdered in a manner similar to the other victims by an unseen contract killer, who proceeds to bury Grayson alive. Nightwing frees himself, wondering the relation between his experience and a [[Monitor (comics)|mysterious voice]] who tells him that he is \"supposed to be dead\". Nightwing is having trouble finding things to keep him busy during the day due to the cast on his right arm. Incapacitated from his injuries, he tries without luck to find jobs and continues to research into the mysterious assassin.\n\nAt one point, Dick agrees to attend a party for Bruce and their relationship seems to flourish. Bruce praises Dick for his success on the Raptor case, and also mentions to look into the Landman Building which hosted ex-Lexcorp scientists; most likely those who worked on the Raptor project. Dick also continues to keep a close brotherly relationship with Tim Drake, and helps Tim deal with his many losses during the last year.\n\nAfter dealing with the Raptor issue, NYC is plagued by a villainous duo called Bride and Groom. Nightwing begins pursuit of these two after some grisly murders, including that of the Lorens family (close friends of his after the Raptor incident). Dick began to get obsessed with finding them, not knowing how far he was willing to go to take them down. Eventually, he formed a makeshift team with some \"villains\" to find them. They located them, and after killing some of his \"team\", Nightwing chased them to a cave, where Bride began a cave-in and the two are trapped there.\n\nNightwing, along with a group of former Titans, are summoned again by Raven to aid the current group of Teen Titans battle against Deathstroke, who was targeting the latest team in order to get at his children, Ravager and the resurrected [[Jericho (comics)|Jericho]]. Nightwing and the other former Titans continue to work with the current team soon after the battle with Deathstroke so as to investigate the recent murder of Duela Dent.\n\nWhen the Outsiders were targeted by Checkmate, Nightwing agrees that his team will work with the organization, so long as their actions in Africa are not used against them in the future. The mission however does not go as well as intended, resulting in Nightwing, the Black Queen and Captain Boomerang being captured by [[Chang Tzu]]. Later, Batman is called in by Mister Terrific who then rescues Nightwing and the others. Afterwards, Nightwing admits to Batman, that while he accepts that he is an excellent leader, he is not suited to lead a team like the Outsiders, and offers the leadership position to Batman.\n\nBatman accepts the position; however, he feels that the team needs to be remade, in order to accomplish the sorts of missions that he intends them to undertake. As such, he holds a series of tryouts for the team. The first audition involves Nightwing and Captain Boomerang who are sent to a space station under attack by [[Chemo (comics)|Chemo]]. During the mission, a confrontation erupts between Nightwing and Boomerang, who has grown tired of fighting for redemption from people like Batman and Nightwing. After taking a beating from Nightwing, he manages to throw him into a shuttle heading for Earth and quits the team. Afterwards, Nightwing furiously confronts Batman. Batman does not deny his actions, and states that this is the sort of thing that the new Outsiders will have to deal with. At this, Nightwing resigns completely from the Outsiders, which Batman feels is best, judging Nightwing too good for that sort of life.\n\nIn order to help himself regain a sense of purpose, Nightwing opted to stay in New York City again, and play the role of the city's protector. He takes on a job as a museum curator; and uses the museum as his new base of operations. During his short time there, Dick finds himself once again confronted with Two-Face, who years ago delivered Dick's greatest defeat. This time however, Dick soundly defeats Two-Face.\n\n====\"Titans Return\"====\nNightwing joins a new team of Titans, with the same roster of the [[Teen Titans#New Teen Titans|New Teen Titans]], to stop an offspring of [[Trigon (comics)|Trigon]], which has not yet been named, from enacting his vengeance over [[Raven (DC Comics)|Raven]] and the Titans, of every generation. Nightwing yet again leads the team, and they manage to stop the sons of Trigon from accomplishing their first attempt at global destruction and again a few days later.\n\nFollowing the defeat of Trigon's sons, the Titans are approached by Jericho who had been stuck inhabiting the body of Match, Superboy's clone. The Titans managed to free Jericho, but found themselves once again in trouble, due to the fact the Jericho's mind had become splintered due to all the bodies he had possessed in the past. Torn between evil and good, Jericho possesses Nightwing's body in order to keep from being captured. During this time, Jericho forces Nightwing to relive all of his greatest pains. Soon after, the JLA arrived, intent on taking Jericho in. Unfortunately they fail to apprehend him.\n\nFollowing this, Nightwing decides to leave the team again, due to the events of the \"[[Batman R.I.P.]]\" storyline, and due to Batman's apparent death, Nightwing feels his attention should be better aimed at protecting Gotham City.\n\n====\"Batman R.I.P\" and \"Battle for the Cowl\"====\nAs a precursor to \"[[Batman R.I.P.]]\", at the New York Comic Con 2008, DC Comics gave away pins featuring Nightwing, Jason Todd, and Hush with the words \"I Am Batman\" beneath them. During the storyline, Nightwing is ambushed by the International [[Batmen of All Nations#Club of Villains|Club of Villains]]. He is later seen in Arkham Asylum, frothing at the mouth and presumably drugged, believed by the staff to be Pierrot Lunaire, a member of the club. Scheduled for an experimental [[lobotomy]] by Arkham himself, he's spared by the ICoV taking hold of the Asylum, wanting to use him and Jezebel Jet, Bruce's fianc\u00e9e at the time, as bait.\n\nAs Jezebel's capture is revealed to be a [[red herring (idiom)|red herring]], due to her being a part of the Black Glove, Nightwing's lobotomy is still pending, but he manages to escape by besting Le Bossu, and joining the fray between the Batman Family, the International Club of Heroes and the Black Glove itself. While he's forced to witness Batman's dragging down Simon Hurt's helicopter and seemingly die in a fiery explosion with his foe, he's shown holding Batman's cape, discarded during the fight.\n\nFollowing the events of Batman's apparent death during ''[[Final Crisis]]'', Nightwing has closed down shop in New York so as to return to Gotham. He has opted to give up on having a normal job, and instead intends to put all his effort into protecting the city. After his returns he confronts Two-Face and Ra's al Ghul, proving two of his mentor's greatest enemies that he is an equal to Batman after he defeated them. He also finds himself being tasked to raise Bruce's biological son [[Damian Wayne|Damian]] with Alfred.\n\nDuring the events of the ''Battle for the Cowl'', Nightwing is said to have become unapproachable and less emotional. He is seen by the Bat-Suit display cases, still mourning the loss of Batman. Nightwing is said to be resisting the idea that someone needs to take up the mantle of Batman, in spite of arguments from Robin and Alfred Pennyworth that it is necessary.<ref>''Batman: Battle for the Cowl'' #1</ref> It is later revealed he has no objections to becoming the new Batman, but was ordered not to in Bruce's prerecorded message for him, saying that Nightwing and Robin could carry the torch.\n\nRobin later informs Grayson that someone is masquerading as Batman, using similar weaponry to their own. Nightwing is later forced to rescue Damian after he is ambushed by Killer Croc and Poison Ivy. However, Nightwing's glider is shot down, and the two are forced to crash land into a skyscraper. In order to give Damian time to escape, Nightwing offers himself up to the hit squad that is after them. He is about to be shot when he is rescued in a hail of gunfire by the Batman impersonator.\n\nThis eventually leads to Dick confronting [[Jason Todd]], who has been posing as Batman. After a long battle between the two, Jason refuses Dick's help, while hanging on to a protruding ledge over Gotham's bay, Jason lets himself fall into the water.<ref>''Batman: Battle for the Cowl'' #2</ref> After returning to the cave, Dick assumes the identity of Batman, with Damian as the new Robin.<ref>''Batman: Battle for the Cowl'' #3</ref>\n\n====The New 52====\n[[File:Nightwing-New52.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Nightwing in his New 52 costume. Cover of ''Nightwing'' (vol. 3) #0 (November 2012). Art by Eddy Barrows.]]\nIn September 2011, [[The New 52]] rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, Grayson's costume changed the color of the \"Nightwing symbol\" from blue to red, and the emblem rolled over the shoulders, rather than traveling down the arm onto the middle and ring fingers. The costume also shifted from a skin-tight unitard look to an armored, full body suit, with spiked gauntlets such as Batman's rather than simply [[long gloves]].<ref>[http://insidepulse.com/2011/06/07/dc-comics-relaunch-nightwing-writer-kyle-higgins-all-a-twitter-about-dick-grayson-time-travel DC Comics Relaunch: Nightwing Writer Kyle Higgins All A-Twitter About Dick], ''Inside Pulse'', June 7, 2011</ref> Dick, along with all other members of the Batfamily, was a few years younger than previous incarnations. Despite being in his early twenties as opposed to his mid-late twenties, he was drawn a bit shorter than in his pre-relaunch frame. Starting with issue 19 there was a change in the suit.\n\nAfter the events of ''Flashpoint'' as part of [[The New 52]], ''Nightwing'' was relaunched with issue #1. Grayson resumes the role of Nightwing following the return of Bruce Wayne. The new series, written by Kyle Higgins, opens with Grayson having returned to Gotham, when Haly's Circus comes to town. Through a series of events, Grayson inherits the circus and is working through internal struggles with his past as he investigates the secrets the circus has brought about.<ref>''Nightwing'' (vol. 3 ) #1-6 (September 2011-February2012)</ref>\n\nDuring the events of ''Death of the Family'', a [[List of Batman supporting characters#Bat-Family|Batman Family]] crossover, Haly's circus is targeted by the Joker. As a result, the circus is burnt down and the circus members leave. Dick is left feeling depressed and lost as a result of this and the death of Damian Wayne, the new Robin, and is at a loss for what to do with his life. However, when Sonia Branch reveals to him that she believes her father, Tony Zucco, is alive and living in [[Chicago]], Dick makes the decision to take him down. Therefore, in 2013 Nightwing relocated to Chicago to hunt down Tony Zucco and also take down The Prankster, a new supervillain hacker in Chicago.\n\nAs part of the ''Forever Evil'' storyline, Nightwing's identity is revealed on every electronic device in the world when Superwoman takes his mask off. Nightwing was captured prior when bringing Zsasz to Arkham Asylum and mistakes Owlman for Batman, which leads to Owlman knocking Grayson out. Currently, Grayson is being held captive by the Crime Syndicate. Owlman plans to ask Grayson to join them to fill in the spot of Earth-3 Richard Grayson who was Owlman's sidekick Talon who died when the Earth-3 vigilante Joker killed him and put his body parts in boxes for Owlman to find.\n\nDuring his captivity, Nightwing is imprisoned in a containment unit built to hold Doomsday, with his heart monitored to set off a bomb should he attempt to escape. The alliance of Batman, Lex Luthor, Catwoman, Captain Cold, Bizarro, Sinestro, Black Manta and Black Adam break into the fallen Watchtower in order to free him but also to sabotage the Syndicate. When they are detected, the bomb is triggered to detonate in minutes. Batman tries to free Nightwing, but Luthor, believing there is no time, incapacitates Batman and Catwoman before suffocating Grayson until his vitals drop and he appears dead. The bomb is deactivated. An enraged Batman begins to brutalize Luthor, while Luthor tries to tell him that there may still be time to revive Dick before he is gone for good \u2013 and so they do. However, with his secret identity compromised, he gives up the Nightwing persona and is persuaded by Batman to fake his death and infiltrate the Spyral organization.\n\nOn January 21, 2014, DC Comics announced that the series would end in April with issue 30. It was succeeded by ''[[Grayson (comic book)|Grayson]]'', a solo series focusing on Dick's exploits as an agent of Spyral. The series lasted until June 2016 and was succeeded by a new ''Nightwing'' series with [[DC Rebirth]].\n\n====DC Rebirth====\n{{main|DC Rebirth}}\nFollowing the erasure of the knowledge regarding his secret identity from most of the world in the final issue of ''Grayson''\n<ref>''Grayson'' #20</ref> Dick went back to the Nightwing identity in the [[DC Rebirth]] era solo series, and the costume's colors were changed back to the traditional black and blue. At the start of the series (rebirth) Nightwing is still a member of the Court of Owls (after Robin War) and he goes on missions around the world for the Court. They give him a partner named \"Raptor\" and like Nightwing he wears a costume, but he is much more violent than Dick and multiple times Dick has to try to stop him from killing. Throughout the story arc, Dick must work as an undercover agent but also has to keep his morals and not kill even if the Court tells him to. Later on in the series, an event causes him to lose his memory, which leads him to the name change of Ric Grayson and temporary retirement of the Nightwing alias.\n\n====Infinite Frontier====\n{{main|Infinite Frontier}}\nIn March 2021, the series became part of DC's new relaunch ''Infinite Frontier''. Tom Taylor became the new writer with Bruno Redondo as the artist. The series follows Dick Grayson's return to Bl\u00fcdhaven as he fights crime while grappling with newfound responsibility from inheriting billions in wealth from [[Alfred Pennyworth]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.comicsbeat.com/tom-taylor-bruno-redondo-nightwing/ |title=Tom Taylor & Bruno Redondo take over NIGHTWING in March |first=Joe |last=Grunenwald |date=December 17, 2020 |website= [[ComicsBeat]] |access-date=May 3, 2021}}</ref> Dick begins to mentor [[Jon Kent (DC Comics)|Jon Kent]] and decides to use the money to launch a nonprofit organization named after Alfred in order to support the people of Bl\u00fcdhaven, which puts him into conflict with [[Blockbuster (DC Comics)|Blockbuster]] and Heartless, a mysterious serial killer preying on the homeless. Dick also meets Melinda Zucco, his long lost half-sister who becomes Bl\u00fcdhaven's mayor.\n\n'''Dark Crisis (2022)'''\n\n===Collected editions===\n\nMost of the original ongoing ''Nightwing'' series was collected in several [[trade paperback (comics)|trade paperbacks]] while the series was being published. Beginning in 2014 the series was then reprinted, with the new editions including material that had been omitted from the previous run of trade paperbacks. Both the ongoing series ''Nightwing Vol. 3'' and ''Nightwing Vol. 4'' have been collected in trade paperbacks as well, during their publication.\n\n====Volume 1 and 2 (Post-Crisis)====\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

At the end of the episode \"Sins of the Father\", Dick Grayson debuts when he remarks that \"no one can be a [[Robin (character)|boy wonder]] forever\". In the episode \"You Scratch My Back\", Nightwing makes his full episode debut and finds an unlikely ally in [[Catwoman]] in trying to expose a South American gun smuggling operation into [[Gotham City]]. This episode highlights Nightwing, hints at his relationship with [[Barbara Gordon|Batgirl]] (Barbara Gordon) and illustrates his tense relationship with [[Batman]]. The episode also contains a sequence \u2013 showing Nightwing in his loft headquarters and charging into the night on his motorcycle as his theme music plays, culminating in a shot where he stands silhouetted against the moon. In the episode \"Old Wounds\", Nightwing explains to [[Tim Drake|Robin]] (Tim Drake) about his last day as Robin, that he fought with Batman over the latter's controlling nature and what the former saw as an unnecessarily harsh approach, causing Dick to leave Gotham as a result and returns years later as Nightwing. Eventually he partially reconciles with his former mentor and works with Batman several times during the course of the series. Nightwing also appears in the episodes \"Joker's Millions\", \"Over the Edge\", \"Animal Act\" and \"Chemistry\".

Pictures]] is developing a Nightwing live action movie centered on the character, set in the [[DC Extended Universe]], with [[Bill Dubuque]] writing the script and ''[[The LEGO Batman Movie]]'' director [[Chris McKay]] signed on to direct the movie.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/warner-bros-plotting-nightwing-movie-lego-batman-movie-director-978737|title=Warner Bros. Plotting Live-Action 'Nightwing' Movie With 'Lego Batman Movie' Director (Exclusive)|work=The Hollywood Reporter|access-date=2018-03-15|language=en}}</ref>\n\nDiscussing why he likes the character and signed on for the project, McKay cited the character's showman personality and background as an entertainer and expressed his excitement for depicting that in the film. He later stated that he wants to introduce a complete adaptation of the character, something that hasn't been done in previous film interpretations of him before. McKay continued to state that the director-driven approach is why he loves [[Warner Bros.]], and how the franchise is differentiating itself from other popular shared universes. McKay also confirmed that the film would acknowledge the titular character's past from the source material, including his time as a part of [[Haly's Circus]], and also reaffirmed that the film will be a straightforward action movie with minimal use of CGI special effects and grounded realism.\n\n==== Animation ====\n* Dick Grayson appears as Nightwing in ''[[Batman: Under The Red Hood]]'', voiced by [[Neil Patrick Harris]]. He first appears to patrol Gotham alongside Batman, offering help when he found him fighting a group of smugglers.
