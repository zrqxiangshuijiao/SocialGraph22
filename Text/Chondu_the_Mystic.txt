Chondu the Mystic first appeared in ''Tales of Suspense'' #9 and was created by [[Doug Wildley]] and [[George Evans (comics)|George Evans]] while his monstrous form was created by [[Steve Gerber]] and [[Sal Buscema]].\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nChondu was once a sideshow [[Magic (illusion)|magician]] before becoming a professional criminal. In his first appearance, he lectured on yoga and sent an escaped convict to [[Limbo (Marvel Comics)|Limbo]].<ref>''Tales of Suspense'' #9</ref>\n\nChondu later joins the [[Headmen]].<ref>''The Defenders'' #21</ref> Dr. [[Gorilla-Man#Gorilla-Man (Arthur Nagan)|Arthur Nagan]] transplants Chondu's brain into [[Nighthawk (Marvel Comics)|Nighthawk's]] body in a bid to exploit the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]]. [[Doctor Strange]] defeats him in a fight and mystically places Chondu's consciousness in a fawn's body. Meanwhile, Nagan and Ruby Thursday carry out a series of alterations to Chondu's original body. His altered body is a monstrous, demonic-looking form with eight lampreys for arms, bird-wings, a horn from his skull, fangs, a forked tongue, and eagles' feet. His consciousness is placed in an artificial brain made out of the same material as Ruby's head. In this form, he had superhuman strength, flight and could constrict objects with his tentacle-like arms. Chondu attempts to kidnap a construction worker to use in a brain transplant, but encounters [[Valkyrie (Marvel Comics)|Valkyrie]] and is arrested by the New York City police.<ref>''The Defenders'' #31-33, 35</ref>\n\nThe Headmen later hire [[Mysterio]] to capture the [[She-Hulk]], and place Chondu's head on a clone of her body, which he does not appreciate. She-Hulk and [[Spider-Man]] battle the Headmen, and in the course of the fight Chondu's head is knocked free from its new body. He survives thanks to life-support equipment attached to his head.<ref>''The Sensational She-Hulk'' #1-3</ref>\n\nAs part of the ''[[All-New, All-Different Marvel]]'' branding, Chondu has been seen as a bartender at the '''Bar with no Doors''', a tavern frequented by various mystics.<ref>''Doctor Strange'' vol. 4 #1</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nChondu can perform intermediate magic as he is an adept in the mystic arts. In his monstrous demonic-like form, he had superhuman strength, flight and the ability to constrict objects with his tentacle-like arms.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://marvel.com/universe/Chondu_the_Mystic Chondu the Mystic] at Marvel.com\n* [http://marvel.wikia.com/wiki/Harvey_Schlemerman_(Earth-616) Chondu the Mystic] at Marvel Wiki\n* [https://comicvine.gamespot.com/chondu/4005-13959/ Chondu the Mystic] at Comic Vine\n* {{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix4/chonduthemystichm.htm|Chondu}}\n\n{{Defenders}}\n{{She-Hulk}}\n{{Marvel Mystic}}\n{{Steve Gerber}}\n\n[[Category:Characters created by Sal Buscema]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Steve Gerber]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1960]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from Rhode Island]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters who use magic]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters with superhuman strength]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics male supervillains]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]"}]}}}}
