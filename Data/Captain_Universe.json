It is the guardian and protector of [[Eternity (comics)|Eternity]]. Rather than a character with a single identity, Captain Universe is a [[persona]] that has merged with several hosts during its publication history.\n\n==Publication history==\nCaptain Universe first appeared in ''[[Micronauts (comics)|Micronauts]]'' #8 and was created by [[Bill Mantlo]] and [[Michael Golden (comics)|Michael Golden]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=DeFalco |first1=Tom |last2=Sanderson |first2=Peter |last3=Brevoort |first3=Tom |last4=Teitelbaum |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |last6=Darling |first6=Andrew |last7=Forbeck |first7=Matt |last8=Cowsill |first8=Alan |last9=Bray |first9=Adam |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-7890-0 |page=78}}</ref>\n\nCaptain Universe hosts have appeared in either special one-shots or short stories throughout the years, initially in the first series of the ''Micronauts'' in 1979.\n\nCaptain Universe was the starring feature in issues #9\u201311 of the tryout series ''[[Marvel Spotlight]]''. The series' editor [[Al Milgrom]] recalled being taken away by the concept of a Captain Universe serial: \"You could come up with three issues, three disparate individuals \u2014 each one very different from the other \u2014 and see how they use their powers. They wouldn't necessarily be superheroic types; they'd be regular people who fell into the powers for just one issue. ... But Captain Universe never got his own title, so I'm guessing it didn't sell terribly well.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last= Buttery |first= Jarrod| title=Ready for the Spotlight  |journal=[[Back Issue!]] |issue= #71| page= 13 |publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]] |date=April 2014|location=Raleigh, North Carolina}}</ref> The character appeared sporadically through the remainder of the 1980s in titles such as ''[[Marvel Fanfare]]'' and ''[[Marvel Super Hero Contest of Champions|Contest of Champions]]''.\n\nHis appearances became even scarcer in the 1990s, appearing in ''Guardians of the Galaxy'', ''What If?'', ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'', ''[[Marvel Comics Presents]]'' and ''Cosmic Powers Unlimited''.\n\nIn 1994, Captain Universe appeared in a one-shot, coinciding with a promotion, with the claim that readers could have a comic about themselves made for a fee. The comics were generally stock stories, with minor details (such as skin or hair color, key names or phrases, etc.) altered based on information provided by the purchaser. Veterinary student Jeff Christiansen, who would later become the force behind the resurgence of the ''[[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe]]'' in the mid-2000s was made the official Captain Universe of the comic so that it could be considered an in-continuity comic. The one-shot was titled ''X-Men/Captain Universe: Sleeping Giants''.\n\nIn 2005, after a four-year break from comic appearances, Captain Universe returned in the second series of ''Amazing Fantasy.''<ref>{{cite comic|title=Amazing Fantasy|volume=2|issue=#13 | date= 2005|story=Power Corrupted, Part One|url=https://www.comics.org/issue/271185/#542773}}</ref> Also in 2005, a series of one-shot specials linked together by the [[Uni-Power]]/Captain Universe were released featuring different characters from the Marvel Universe as the Uni-Power each imbues them with power of Captain Universe. These titles were ''Captain Universe/Hulk'', ''Captain Universe/Daredevil'', ''Captain Universe/X-23'', ''Captain Universe/Invisible Woman'' and ''Captain Universe/Silver Surfer''. The Uni-Power made a brief appearance in ''Nextwave'', he also made a \"cameo\" as Cosmic Spider-Man for the variant cover of ''Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man'' #3 and played an important part in the [[Death's Head 3.0]] saga chronicled in ''Amazing Fantasy''.\n\nCaptain Universe made his return in ''[[Annihilation: Conquest]]: Star-Lord'' and then in ''Annihilation Conquest'' #3. Captain Universe later returns to stop the [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]], in an attempt to fulfill his destiny, as seen in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #627\u2013629.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nThe Uni-Power is an extra-dimensional force that possesses an individual (or on one occasion, twins) in a time of crisis, transforming that person into Captain Universe. As Captain Universe, the transformed person typically retains his or her original personality and appearance, though with Captain Universe's costume and heroic traits superimposed over the original. The Uni-Power itself emanates from the Enigma Force, the exact nature of which, naturally, remains an enigma. It is believed, however, to be connected to the [[Microverse]], home of the [[Micronauts (comics)|Micronauts]]. Although the Uni-Power typically empowers normal, non-super-powered humans, it has in the past empowered [[Doctor Strange]], [[Spider-Man]], Commander Arcturus Rann of the Micronauts, a toddler, and a dog, among others. Its counterparts in various [[alternate timeline]]s have also possessed [[Mar-Vell]], [[Mr. Fantastic]], a member of the alien [[Badoon]] race, a Doombot and [[Quasar (comics)|Quasar]]. Because of its never-ending supply of energy it has been the target of many individuals, terrorist groups and peacekeeping agencies such as [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|AIM]], the [[Psycho-Man]], [[Doctor Doom]] and even S.H.I.E.L.D.\n\nThe first human Captain Universe was an astronaut named Captain Ray Coffin. He battled [[Baron Karza]] and sealed the Prometheus Pit between the Microverse and Earth.<ref>''Micronauts'' #8. Marvel Comics.</ref> Years later, the Uni-Power would possess his son Steve Coffin to battle Mister E and his shadow slaves.<ref name=\"Marvel Spotlight Vol. 2 #10\">''[[Marvel Spotlight]]'' vol. 2 #10.

The latently cosmic-powered Spider-Man battled the [[Trapster]], [[Titania (Marvel Comics)|Titania]], [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]], [[Brothers Grimm (comics)#Second pair|Brothers Grimm]], [[Erik Josten|Goliath]], Hulk, [[TESS-One]], [[Dragon Man (comics)|Dragon Man]], and the Tri-Sentinel itself.<ref>''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #158\u2013160; ''Web of Spider-Man'' #59\u201361; ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #327\u2013329; ''Quasar'' #7. Marvel Comics.</ref> It next possessed a toddler called Eddie Price to battle Gart and Rath.<ref>''Web of Spider-Man'' Annual #6. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nWhen the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (1969 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]] traveled to the 20th century on a mission to destroy the [[Badoon]], the Uni-Power possessed a Badoon worker named L'Matto to prevent the planned genocide. L'Matto's newfound knowledge was able to keep the Guardians from attacking but the Brother Royal then used the Badoon Captain Universe as his champion in a gladiatorial challenge which he had coerced the Guardians into accepting. L'Matto easily overpowered [[Charlie-27]] and was about to kill him when [[Vance Astro]] and Dr. Strange arrived and joined in the battle, with [[Nikki (comics)|Nikki]] and [[Talon (Marvel Comics)|Talon]] pitching in as well. Despite this, it was not until [[Aleta Ogord|Aleta]] (who had become the new [[Starhawk (comics)|Starhawk]]) arrived and attacked alongside Doctor Strange that L'Matto was finally defeated, enabling Strange to exorcise the Uni-Power which L'Matto had abused and return it to Earth.<ref>''Guardians of the Galaxy'' #30\u201333. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nCaptain Universe later returned, and the Uni-Power possesses various heroes (the [[Hulk]]; [[X-23]]; [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]], who regained his sight while possessed; the [[Invisible Woman]]; [[Gladiator (Kallark)|Gladiator]]; and the [[Silver Surfer]]); all in a mission to restore its power which has been severely weakened from a mysterious force emanating from the darkest corners of the Microverse. Using the copied powers of each hero, it took paraplegic war veteran Gabriel Vargas as its host to face the one responsible for its weakening.\n\nAt some unknown point, Captain Universe's latest host Gabriel Vargas is arrested by the Kree Government for accidentally attacking a group of Kree who were killing people who he thought were innocents but were actually sympathetic to the genocidal actions of the Annihilation Wave. For months, he was studied by the Kree who, despite their highly advanced technology, could not learn much about the Uni-Power other than that the suit given to all users is actually a molecular shell and not spandex as was previously believed. Eventually, Gabriel is released from prison and put into a highly aggressive session of training by the Kree Military as he and several other prisoners prepare for a mission that will halt the Phalanx's technophage virus from spreading further.<ref>''Annihilation: Conquest \u2013 Starlord'' #1 (w) Keith Giffen (2007).

Marvel Comics.</ref> He was subsequently killed by the Phalanx select Blastaar during an attack on the Phalanx Babel Spire.<ref>''Annihilation: Conquest'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nDuring \"[[The Gauntlet and Grim Hunt|The Gauntlet]]\" storyline, a new Captain Universe makes himself known when he arrives on Earth with plans to kill [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]].<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #627. Marvel Comics.</ref> Spider-Man learns that Captain Universe is a man named William Nguyen, whose life had been ruined in one of Juggernaut's rampages.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #628. Marvel Comics.</ref> When Nguyen insists on trying to kill Juggernaut instead of fixing the tectonic plates beneath New York City, the Uni-Power leaves him and enters the Juggernaut. The Juggernaut as Captain Universe repairs the damage to the tectonic plates that was caused by him during the same rampage that had ruined Nguyen's life. After the \"healing\" of the tectonic plates, the Uni-Power subsequently departs.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #629. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nThree former hosts of the Uni-Power (Susan Storm, Spider-Man and X-23) are all contacted by the Enigma Force once again when the Whirldemon King, a powerful entity once defeated by the time-traveling Prince Wayfinder of Ithaca and creator of the Enigma Force itself, escapes imprisonment. When X-23 sacrifices herself to save [[Valeria Richards]] from possession by the King the Uni-Power bonds with her a second time. While trapped in the Whirldemons' prison dimension, a connection is explicitly made between a starry apparition that enabled Laura to throw off the influence of a demon attempting to coerce her into serving it,<ref>''X-23'' #1\u20133. Marvel Comics.</ref> when the star-shaped mark left on Laura's palm after that encounter is recognized by the Whirldemon King as associated with the Enigma Force. Laura then uses the Uni-Power to wound the Whirldemon King and seal him back in his prison dimension, before returning her to Earth. During these events the Enigma Force tells Laura that she has been designated the future heir to its power.<ref>''X-23'' #13\u201316.

The Enigma Force chose to make [[Miles Morales]] the new Captain Universe, which he used to help defeat them. Using the Sword Vigor from Leopardon, Miles was able to defeat Solus, Brix, Bora, and Daemos. The Enigma Force left him after the battle was won.<ref>''Spider-Geddon'' #4-5. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nDuring the \"[[King in Black]]\" storyline, the Enigma Force is revealed by [[Jean Grey]] to be the \"God of Light\" of the Marvel Universe, with properties similar to those of symbiotes and counterpart of the malevolent, darkness-based deity [[Knull (character)|Knull]]. Silver Surfer arrives to where the Enigma Force is and frees it from the symbiotes, leading to it choosing [[Eddie Brock]] as the new Captain Universe.<ref>''King in Black'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nCaptain Universe generally possesses [[superhuman]] strength, flight, Uni-Vision (microscopic vision, [[X-ray]] vision, and telescopic vision), [[telekinesis]], enhanced senses, and a psychic awareness of imminent danger; when a person already possessing one or more of these abilities was transformed into Captain Universe, those abilities were amplified by vast amounts.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Wyse |first=Alex |date=2018-11-22 |title=Star Power: 20 Characters Who Had The Power Cosmic, Ranked By Power |url=https://www.cbr.com/power-cosmic-users-ranked/ |access-date=2022-10-08 |website=CBR |language=en-US}}</ref> Some manifestations of the Uni-Power have demonstrated other, less common abilities as well as failing to exhibit some of the more 'usual' powers, which vary in intensity with each wielder according to the strength and imagination of each. Captain Universe usually possesses the ability of molecular rearrangement of organic and inorganic matter, transmutation of elements, the ability to fire bursts of energy and concussive force, and hypnosis (using the Uni-Vision energy).<ref>{{Cite web |last=Natividad |first=Sid |date=2019-08-17 |title=10 Things Fans Need To Know about Marvel's Captain Universe |url=https://www.cbr.com/marvel-captain-universe-things-fans-need-to-know/ |access-date=2022-10-08 |website=CBR |language=en-US}}</ref> Possessing its own sentience, the Uni-Power can and will abandon a host if necessary, or if said host uses or intends to use the granted abilities in a detrimental or criminal fashion.\n\nAs with the [[Infinity Gems]], the only depicted weakness of the power of the Enigma Force is that it is tied to the dimension of its origin, with the wielders losing their powers if they travel to other realities.<ref name=\"asm9\">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 3 #9.

The duplicate, referred to as the 'Alias-Power' or 'Uni-Alias', has the ability to animate the [[Death's Head]] 3.0 robot. While resident in Death's Head, it took the form of a conscience. On one occasion, when asked to rescue an evil scientist from a jail, it instead rescued a human rights activist. When the robot killed a UN researcher, the power brought him back to life. The researcher then confronted the robot, forcing it to acknowledge the conscience. Afterwards, Death's Head began working for the UN as an anti-terrorist hit-man.<ref>''Amazing Fantasy'' #16\u201320.

Shocked to find his comrades dead, Quasar screamed into the Heavens as a glowing red light consumed him. It changed him and infused him with the powers of Captain Universe. After merging the Uni-Power with his own Quantum Bands; Quasar took Doctor Strange's Eye of Agamotto and left the imploding dimension.\n\nWhen he arrived most of the remaining heroes had been murdered by either Set's fearsome power or at the hands of his seven mind controlled brides. Quasar found The Silver Surfer attempting to keep the creature at bay. Filled with an immeasurable amount of rage the Quasar/Captain Universe entity summoned the Eye of Agamotto and pulled himself and Set into the Eye's pocket dimension where they would do battle for all eternity. Later on, Quasar of [[Earth-616]] viewed his counterpart facing Set.\n\n===Spider-Ham becomes Captain Zooniverse===\n<!--[[Spider-Ham]] (Peter Porker) is a real character, and this section is about him. PLEASE stop changing this section to talk about Spider-Man.-->In the Larval Zooniverse, Peter Porker (who was secretly the superhero [[Spider-Ham]]) was working on an experiment that went awry and bestowed upon him the cosmic power of Captain Zooniverse. With this new power he defeated all of his enemies and trapped them in orbit around Earth. He returned home a bit later and began a new villain-free life with his girlfriend Mary Jane Waterbuffalo.<ref>''Marvel Tales'' #236 (April 1990).

They were headed by an intelligent version of the [[Hulk]] who was not Bruce Banner. Joining this strange version of the behemoth were the World War II-era heroes [[Red Raven (Marvel Comics)|Red Raven]], [[Bucky Barnes|Bucky]], [[Namora]] and The [[Whizzer (Robert Frank)|Whizzer (Bob Frank)]]. Other members included a heroic version of the [[Spider-Man]] villain [[Richard Fisk|The Rose]], [[Doctor Druid]], [[Living Lightning]], the [[Shroud (comics)|Shroud]] and a male Captain Universe.{{issue|date=April 2014}} (The membership of the Law Enforcement Squad paralleled the membership of [[DC Comics]]' [[Justice Society of America]].{{original research inline|date=April 2014}} Captain Universe was the equivalent of DC's [[Starman (comics)|Starman]].{{original research inline|date=April 2014}})\n\nThe true identity of this Captain Universe was never revealed but the host had more than likely had the Uni-Power for several years. During the battle that ensued between the Law Enforcement Squad and the Fantastic Four; Captain Universe and Dr. Druid ganged up on Reed Richards to destabilize the Fantastic Four's cohesion as a team. With only seconds to spare, Reed convinces Captain Universe that something is out of place and that the Fantastic Four are not his enemies. Captain Universe reveals to Druid that Reed is telling the truth, but before he can convince the others to stop fighting, he is struck down by [[Nova (Frankie Raye)|Nova]].\n\nReed and Druid travel into a portal left by Captain Universe's \"death\" only to find him alive and well within the body of Earth-616's [[Eternity (comics)|Eternity]]. Captain Universe explains to the two superheroes of the creation of the Multi-Eternity that ensures a boundless [[Parallel universe (fiction)|multiverse]]. Afterwards Captain Universe vanishes without a trace while Reed and Druid return to their respective realities after a confrontation with Abraxas, the antithesis of Eternity and Galactus.\n\n===Captain Universe of Earth X===\nCaptain Universe's history in the ''[[Earth X]]'' series was relatively the same as it had been on Earth-616 up until the ''Infinity Gauntlet Saga'', where an unknown Captain Universe fought alongside [[Kismet (Marvel Comics)|Kismet]], the [[Silver Surfer]], [[Comet Man]], [[Carol Danvers]], [[Nova (Richard Rider)|Nova]] and [[Star-Lord]]. Years later Arcturus Rann died in a battle against the Psycho Man and took the Enigma Force with him to the afterlife. Captain Universe was transferred into the Kree superhero Mar-Vell and eventually became part of a completed Cosmic Conscience which revived the Perfect Knowledge of the Perfect Universe which had been destroyed countless millennia ago by The Celestials. Captain Universe later joined with Reed Richards to form the new Eternity. They were last seen preparing to save Franklin from The [[Celestial (comics)|Celestials]] and The [[Elders of the Universe]].\n\n===Spider-Verse===\nIn the ''[[Spider-Verse]]'' storyline when multiple Spider-Men are being hunted across parallel universes, they find a safe haven in Earth-13, a world where Peter Parker still possesses the Enigma Force. Although this power cannot be used in other universes as it is tied to the dimension of its origin, this Spider-Man reasoned that he would be able to protect the other Spiders from the Inheritors if they attacked his home universe.<ref name=\"asm9\"/> This strategy proves to be flawed when the Inheritors' father Solus, attacks his world, proclaiming that the Enigma-Force is pure life force. While it may prove to be too much for any of his children to handle, his own greater power is able to consume it allowing him to devour this Spider-Man's lifeforce.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 3 #11.
