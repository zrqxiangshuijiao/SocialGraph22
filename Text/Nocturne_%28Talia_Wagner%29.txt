The character is depicted as a member of the reality-hopping [[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]] and formerly associated with [[Excalibur (comics)#New Excalibur (2005\u20132007)|New Excalibur]].\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nNocturne is from an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternative reality]] [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|outside]] the main [[Marvel Universe]] ([[Earth-616]]). She is the daughter of that reality's [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]]<ref name=\"X-Men 2000\"/> and the [[Scarlet Witch]].<ref name=\"Exiles #4\">''Exiles'' #4</ref> She is based on [[Jim Calafiore]]'s \"Professor W's X-Men\" entry of the ''X-Men Millennial Visions'' 2000 one-shot.\n\n===Life in the X-Men===\nT.J. grew up around the X-Men and under her father's care, while her mother remains a member of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]. [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] attacks [[Professor X|Charles Xavier]] while under the control of the [[Shadow King]]. The Shadow King is expelled from Wolverine's mind, but Xavier is fatally wounded in the attack and Logan is left crippled. [[Jean Grey]] dies shortly after the attack, and [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] blames Wolverine for both deaths and abandons the team. As a result, Wolverine and Nightcrawler take over as leaders of the [[X-Men]] and the [[X-Mansion|Xavier Institute]]. Nocturne becomes an active member of the X-Men when she is seventeen years old, and has faced several of the team's most dangerous foes, including [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] and a vengeance-seeking Cyclops. Nocturne saves Wolverine's life during Cyclops's attack by possessing her unconscious teammate [[Armageddon (Marvel Comics)|Armageddon]] and using his telekinetic powers to move Wolverine's paralyzed arms to impale Cyclops.<ref name=\"Exiles #42\">''Exiles'' #42</ref>\n\n===Exiles===\n{{main|Exiles (Marvel Comics)|l1=Exiles}}\nAt twenty years old, Nocturne is taken by the [[Timebroker]] and told she had become \"unhinged from time.\"<ref name=\"Exiles #1\">''Exiles'' #1</ref> The Timebroker tells Nocturne that if she does not work to right the wrongs that have occurred in a multitude of [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|alternate universes]], her own timeline would remain altered and she would be returned to a universe in which Nightcrawler was murdered some time ago by his mother, [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]]. So Nocturne becomes a member of the reality-hopping [[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]].<ref name=\"Exiles #1\"/>\n\nOver the course of the Exiles' first adventures, Nocturne develops a romantic relationship with teammate [[Thunderbird (John Proudstar)|John Proudstar/Thunderbird]], who is the former [[Horsemen of Apocalypse|horseman]], War, for his reality's [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]]. By the time the team is trapped for a month on a [[Skrull]]-dominated alternate Earth, Nocturne is pregnant with Thunderbird's child. However, John is horribly wounded during his efforts to repel [[Galactus]] during that mission, and is left behind when the team moves to the next reality.<ref>''Exiles'' #8-10</ref> Nocturne later miscarries the baby; it is unclear whether the miscarriage is natural, or whether she terminated the pregnancy herself. Although devastated by the loss of Thunderbird, Nocturne remains a competent member of the Exiles and eventually regains much of her sunny demeanor.[[Image:Exiles1 cover.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Cover to ''Exiles'' #1. Nocturne is in the lower left corner. This is the first appearance of Nocturne on a cover to a comic book. Art by Mike McKone.]]\n\nNocturne, and the Exiles, go to the main [[Marvel Universe]] where they meet the [[X-Men]] after [[Havok (comics)|Havok]]'s cancelled wedding.<ref>''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #425-426</ref> The Exiles team up with the X-Men against an evil Havok from the ''[[Mutant X (comics)|Mutant X]]'' universe, who shares a body with the good Havok. After Havok is subdued, the Timebroker arrives to personally eliminate the ''Mutant X'' Havok's consciousness. During this mission Nocturne meets this version of Nightcrawler, whom she accidentally calls \"Dad\" at first. The demeanor of the main Marvel Universe Nightcrawler is very similar to that of the Nightcrawler from Nocturne's reality, so the two develop a close bond that resembles a father-daughter relationship.<ref>''Exiles'' #28-30</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Marvel graphic novels and related publications: an annotated guide to comics, ... |last=Weiner |first=Robert |year=2008 |publisher=Mc Farland |isbn=978-0-7864-2500-6 |page=105 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=npIsZV7grboC |access-date=February 26, 2010}}</ref>\n\nAfter a few more missions the Exiles come back to the [[Marvel Universe]], and are given a new teammate, [[Namora#Exiles|Namora]], and a new mission from the Tallus: \"Leave your possessions and earn your wings\". [[Mister Fantastic|Mr. Fantastic]] of the [[Fantastic Four]] eventually deciphered the mission's meaning: [[Barnell Bohusk|Beak]] of the X-Men has to go with the Exiles and Nocturne has to stay behind in the main Marvel Universe.<ref>''Exiles'' #46-48</ref>\n\n===Brotherhood/Return from Mojoworld===\nNocturne then infiltrates [[Exodus (comics)#Brotherhood of Mutants|Exodus]]' new [[Brotherhood of Mutants|Brotherhood]], but is sucked into [[Xorn]]'s head, along with several other members of the Brotherhood, while possessing [[Black Tom Cassidy]].<ref>''X-Men'' #161-164</ref> She ends up in Mojoworld with [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]] (another Brotherhood mole), and is enslaved by [[Mojo (comics)|Mojo]]. To escape, Nocturne takes control of Mojo's henchman, [[Spiral (comics)|Spiral]], and opens a portal to the X-Men's [[Danger Room]], where they were reunited with the X-Men.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #460</ref> However, this is a trap set by Spiral who was in more control of her body than thought, leaving a portal open to allow Mojo to cross over as well. Mojo turns the X-Men into [[X-Babies]] and sends his \"Exile Legal Eagles\" after them, but they manage to overpower his forces anyway. The group is re-aged, and Nocturne remains with the X-Men for the time being.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #461</ref>\n\n===''House of M''===\nDuring the ''[[House of M]]'' reality, Nocturne is sought by [[Callisto (comics)|Callisto]]'s [[Marauders (comics)|Marauders]] for having royal Magnus blood (because she is an alternate reality daughter of [[Scarlet Witch]], a fact she doesn't remember due to her extradimensional origin which left her amnesiatic), but is protected by [[Betsy Braddock#House of M|Psylocke]] and [[Rachel Summers|Marvel Girl]]. Marvel Girl allows Nocturne to possess her in order to keep her out of the Marauders' reach, but Nocturne ends up taking control, and in a confused daze, flies away. Psylocke pursues, eventually culminating in a telekinetic blade battle, which Psylocke wins. This allows Marvel Girl's own consciousness to resurface. The three of them fight off the Marauders together and later help [[Captain Britain]] and [[Meggan (character)|Meggan]] prevent reality from being destroyed.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #462-465</ref>\n\n===''New Excalibur''===\n{{main|Excalibur (comics)#New Excalibur (2005\u20132007)|l1=New Excalibur}}\nNocturne next appears in [[Excalibur (comics)|New Excalibur]], alongside [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]], [[Sage (comics)|Sage]], [[Dazzler (Marvel Comics)|Dazzler]], [[Captain Britain]], and [[Pete Wisdom]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=5130 |title=Ww Philly: X-Men: The Shape of Comics to Come |author=Justin Jordan |date=June 3, 2005 |work=[[Comic Book Resources]] |access-date=February 26, 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=5829 |title=\"New Excalibur\" #1 Brings Back Britain's Premiere Superhero Team |author=Jonah Weiland |date=October 18, 2005 |work=[[Comic Book Resources]] |access-date=February 26, 2011 }}</ref> During her time with New Excalibur, Nocturne developed the ability to possess people ''without'' knocking them unconscious.\n\nShe also suffered a [[stroke]] while on the team.<ref>''New Excalibur'' #16</ref> She suffered aftereffects, such as [[hemiparesis]], partial [[Retrograde amnesia|memory loss]], and [[aphasia]], but was making great strides towards recovery<ref>''New Excalibur'' #20</ref> Despite this, while only partially recovered, she was able to save numerous civilians in the battle against Albion by possessing one of Albion's evil Captain Britains. She was recently reunited with the Exiles, including her lover Thunderbird who is no longer comatose.<ref>''[[X-Men: Die by the Sword]]'' #1-5</ref> However her return to the Exiles is short, because after defeating Mad Jim Jaspers, Nocturne and Thunderbird leave to help their relationship grow and to help Nocturne more fully recover from her stroke.<ref>''Exiles'' #100</ref> Along with Blink, they go to [[Heather Hudson (Exiles)|Heather]]'s reality so Heather can keep track of Nocturne's health as she continues to recover from her stroke.\n\n===Return to the Exiles===\nNocturne made a brief appearance in the final issue of ''Exiles'' vol. 2 seemingly having completely recovered from her stroke. She, along with the current team of Exiles, Morph, and Heather briefly merges with the Crystal Palace as a female version of Kang explains the nature of the universe. Also she takes charge of the current team of Exiles while Blink is off to recruit another group of superheroes.<ref>''Exiles'' vol. 2 #6</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nLike her [[Nightcrawler (comics)#Powers and abilities|father]], T.J. has a radically unique physiology. She has blue fur covering her body, three fingers per hand, two toes per foot, and a retractable<ref name=\"Exiles #42\"/> prehensile tail.\n\nHer agility, balance, bodily coordination and flexibility are at superhuman levels. She can move in manners that surpass those of an Olympic level gymnast, and has a bone structure allowing great flexibility. She can remain in a crouched position for a long time and perform contortionist-type feats without causing any damage to her spine. She has an ability to cling to surfaces with her hands and feet in a manner similar to Nightcrawler. Her fur provides near-invisibility when in the shadows, and she has excellent vision in dark conditions.\n\nNocturne's powers include the ability to enter and [[Spiritual possession|possess]] another person's body for up to 12 hours; the experience usually leaves the other person comatose for up to 24 hours. Nocturne can also fire \"hex bolts,\" destructive projectiles made up of extradimensional energy from the dimension through which Nightcrawler teleports.<ref name=\"Exiles #4\"/>\n\nNocturne also has a degree of latent telepathy, but it was only usable to any degree when enhanced by a [[Cerebro]] machine.<ref name=\"Exiles #1\"/> She does not appear to possess any abilities related to her mother's [[Scarlet Witch#Powers and abilities|reality alteration abilities]], but the \"hex bolts\" that she derives from her father are named after her mother's powers in [[Homage (arts)|homage]].\n\n==Other versions==\n* Before the start of ''[[X-Men: The End]]'' trilogy of miniseries, Nocturne is captured by Tullamore Voge and turned into one of his slavers. During ''X-Men: The End'', [[Aliyah Bishop]] saves her from Voge,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicsbulletin.com/reviews/109204518586594.htm |title=X-Men: The End: Book One #1 |author=Shawn Hill |date=August 9, 2004 |work=Comics Bulletin |access-date=February 26, 2011 }}</ref> and Nocturne aids the X-Men in the final battle with [[Cassandra Nova]]. She is one of the lucky ones to survive the final battle, and lives with Nightcrawler and his family. She is seen among the survivors twenty years later at [[Alternative versions of Kitty Pryde#X-Men: The End|President Kitty Pryde]]'s speech to the mutants.\n* In the 1990 ''[[Days of Future Present]]'' crossover storyline, a future version of [[Franklin Richards (Fantastic Four)|Franklin Richards]] reveals the [[New Mutants]] of the future, including a similar appearing daughter of Nightcrawler named Blue.<ref>''[[New Mutants]] Annual'' #6. Marvel Comics.</ref> This character, however, possesses her father's teleportation abilities, albeit at a greatly enhanced scale.\n\n==Relations==\nNocturne has strong relationships with many of her fellow X-Men, including her \"aunt\" [[Kitty Pryde]] and her boyfriend [[Warpath (comics)|James Proudstar]], her reality's [[Thunderbird (John Proudstar)|Thunderbird]]. She is also very close to her father, Nightcrawler. Due to her being the daughter of Nightcrawler and the Scarlet Witch she is part of a very large and complex family.
