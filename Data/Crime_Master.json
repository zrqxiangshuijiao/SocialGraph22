The character is depicted as an example of the professional-criminal type, and an enemy of [[Spider-Man]].<ref>{{cite book |last =Rovin |first =Jeff |title =The Encyclopedia of Supervillains |publisher =Facts on File |date =1987 |location =New York |isbn = 0-8160-1356-X |page=6}}</ref> Created and designed by artist and plotter [[Steve Ditko]] with writer and editor [[Stan Lee]], he first appeared in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #26, published in July 1965.\n\nThe character was most notable for having briefly been the partner of the [[Green Goblin]]. Both villains aspired to take over the criminal mobs of New York, and they formed an uneasy partnership. They were both aware of each other's secret identities, which kept them from outwardly betraying the other. The Crime Master only lasted two issues, being killed at the conclusion of ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #27; however, there was a second Crime Master in the 1970s, and new stories were written in the pages of ''[[Untold Tales of Spider-Man]]'' that featured the original character before his death.\n\n==Publication history==\nThe Crime Master debuted in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #26,<ref>{{cite book|last = Manning|first = Matthew K.|last2= Gilbert|first2= Laura, ed.|chapter= 1960s|title = Spider-Man Chronicle Celebrating 50 Years of Web-Slinging|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|year = 2012|page = 29|isbn = 978-0756692360|quote= While he wouldn't have the same staying power as many other Stan Lee/Steve Ditko creations, the Crime Master gave villainy a good shot in this first half of a two-part Spider-Man adventure.}}</ref> his identity unknown. He was killed and revealed as Nicholas \"Nick\" \"Lucky\" Lewis after his death. His son, Nicholas Lewis Jr., became the second Crime Master in ''Marvel Team-Up'' #39 (November 1975) and #40 and teamed up with the second ''Big Man''. This Crime-Master did not know the identity of his partner and betrayed and shot to death the Big Man, who turned out to be his girlfriend Janice Foswell, daughter of [[Frederick Foswell]], the original Big Man, after unmasking. Devastated by the discovery, Lewis Jr. has not appeared as the Crime Master since.\n\nThe original Crime Master was also featured in an untold story from before his death in ''Untold Tales of Spider-Man'' #23 (August 1997) and again in ''Untold Tales of Spider-Man'' #25. That issue is somewhat controversial as it alters the storyline from ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #26-27. This story shows the Crime Master and the Green Goblin reveal their identities to each other. The Goblin, however, is wearing a mask of [[J. Jonah Jameson]] under his Goblin mask so as to suggest that the Crime Master really believed that Jameson was the Goblin instead of Norman Osborn. This does not make sense in the continuity of ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #26 as thought bubbles reveal that the Goblin is concerned about the Crime-Master revealing his identity.\n\nA third Crime Master has recently appeared. starting in the revival of the ''Venom'' book. This one is a powerful crime lord, with extensive resources, connections, and henchmen, chief among them the new [[Jack O'Lantern (Marvel Comics)|Jack O'Lantern]]. It was ultimately revealed that the third Crime Master is Bennett Brant, the brother of [[Betty Brant]].\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n\n===Nicholas Lewis Sr. (\"Lucky Lewis\")===\n{{Infobox comics character|\n|image=\n|caption=\n|character_name=Crime Master I\n|real_name=Nicholas \"Nick\" Lewis/\"Lucky Lewis\"\n|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]\n|debut=''Amazing Spider-Man'' #26 (July 1965)\n|creators=[[Stan Lee]]<br>[[Steve Ditko]] (designer)\n|alliances=\n|\n}}\n\nNick \"Lucky\" Lewis was a masked criminal who attempted to organize all non-[[Maggia (comics)|Maggia]] New York City crime gangs under his control.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #26</ref> He was opposed by [[Spider-Man]], [[Frederick Foswell]], and especially his chief rival, the [[Green Goblin]], whose real name, [[Norman Osborn]], he had found out. The Crime Master's attempt to build a criminal empire failed when Foswell informed the police about a large crime boss gathering he (the Crime Master) had organized. Seeking revenge on Foswell, he prepared to assassinate Spider-Man, [[J.

After learning that both their fathers died due to alleged involvement by [[Spider-Man]], Lewis decided to take up his father's identity as the Crime Master to avenge his death. Unknowingly, Janice also had the same idea and disguised herself as the new Big Man. Both met and joined up to battle Spider-Man, the [[Human Torch]] and the [[Sons of the Tiger]]; but when they got into an argument about who was in charge, Janice was fatally shot by Nick.

He ended up in a gambling debt with a gangster named Blackie Gaxton to pay for his mother's medical bills. With the help of [[Doctor Octopus]], Blackie Gaxton kidnapped Bennett and Betty as insurance against anyone who wanted to prevent him from leaving the country. Bennett was double-crossed by Blackie Gaxton, who refused to free him of any debts. Blackie was fatally shot during a melee between Blackie Gaxton's gang, Doctor Octopus, and [[Spider-Man]].<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #11</ref>\n\nMany years later, a new Crime Master appeared in the ''Venom'' series. He proved to be a shrewd planner, with substantial resources and many henchmen. His paths first crossed with [[Flash Thompson|Eugene \"Flash\" Thompson]], the most recent host of the Venom symbiote, when Flash was sent to stop a mad scientist who had developed powerful [[Vibranium#Antarctic variety|Antarctic Vibranium]] bullets for the Crime Master.<ref>''Venom'' [[List of Venom titles|vol. 2]], #1</ref>\n\nThe Crime Master subsequently organized his own team to destroy Venom, which he called the [[Savage Six]]. It consisted of himself, [[Jack O'Lantern (Marvel Comics)|Jack-O-Lantern]], the [[Human Fly (comics)#Richard Deacon|Human Fly]], the [[Death Adder (comics)|Death Adder]], [[Megatak]], and [[Toxin (comics)|Toxin]] (which now has [[Eddie Brock]] as a host after losing the Anti-Venom symbiote back in the ''[[Spider-Island]]'' storyline).<ref>''Venom'' (vol. 2) #17</ref> When Betty Brant was brought before the Crime Master, she was shocked when the Crime Master revealed himself to be her own brother, Bennett Brant, who invited Betty to join him in killing Venom.<ref>''Venom'' (vol. 2) #20</ref> After his unmasking, Brant claimed that the Crime Master identity went back centuries, and that the bearer of it was chosen by an enigmatic criminal empire. After Venom arrived at his hideout, Bennett Brant almost killed him with a sonic pistol and a flamethrower, but he was shot and killed by Betty. When Venom began to make a comment on this, Betty stated that her brother \"died a long time ago.\"<ref>''Venom'' (vol. 2) #21</ref>\n\n===Impostor Crime Master===\nVenom later came across another Crime Master who was smuggling weapons into the city.

The Superior Spider-Man breaks into the building just as the Crime Master takes off his mask. It is revealed that the man under the mask is an unnamed [[Maggia (comics)|Maggia]] operative who had just bought the Crime Master identity and gear from the [[Roderick Kingsley|Hobgoblin]]. The Maggia operative then surrenders.<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #22</ref>\n\nThe Crime Master subsequently hires the [[Blood Spider]], [[Death-Shield]], and [[Jagged Bow]] to help him steal a damaged Rigellian Recorder from [[Deadpool]] and the Mercs for Money.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Cullen Bunn|penciller = Salva Espin|inker = Salva Espin|colorist = Guru-eFX|letterer = VC's Joe Sabino|editor = Jordan D.
