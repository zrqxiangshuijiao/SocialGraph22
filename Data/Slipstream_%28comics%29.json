He is a [[superhero]] associated with the [[X-Men]]. Created by writer [[Chris Claremont]] and artist [[Salvador Larroca]], he first appeared in ''[[X-Treme X-Men]]'' #6 (December 2001).\n \nHe is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]], able to generate a \"warp wave\" for the purpose of [[teleportation]]. He and his sister [[Lifeguard (comics)|Lifeguard]] were briefly members of the squad of [[X-Men]] featured in the series ''X-Treme X-Men.''\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nHe and his sister [[Lifeguard (comics)|Heather]] lived perfectly normal lives at [[Surfers Paradise]] in [[Australia]]. They did not know that their actual father was an underworld crime lord known as [[Viceroy (comics)|Viceroy]]. Upon his death, they were attacked.<ref>''X-Treme X-Men'' #6</ref> When Heather's life was endangered, Davis was informed by [[Sage (comics)|Sage]] that although he was never meant to be a mutant (his latent mutant gene was supposed to be passed down to his children), his mutant power might be helpful to her. He agreed to let her activate it, gaining a teleportational ability in the form of the \"warp wave\".<ref>''X-Treme X-Men'' #8</ref> Together with [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] and [[Thunderbird (Neal Shaara)|Thunderbird III]], he and his sister manage to defeat their attackers.<ref>''X-Treme X-Men'' #9</ref> Following these events, both siblings join Storm's team of X-Men.<ref>''X-Treme X-Men'' #9</ref> Davis had a brief romance with Storm.<ref>''X-Treme X-Men'' #10-14</ref>\n\nLater, when infiltrating the ship of the intergalactic warlord, [[Khan (comics)|Khan]], Heather develops a more avian look, leading to speculation that the two have [[Shi'ar]] heritage.<ref>''Heroic Age: X-Men'' #1</ref> Ultimately, Davis is unable to see past his sister's alien appearance and leaves the X-Men.<ref>''X-Treme X-Men'' #19</ref>\n\nSlipstream is confirmed to be among the mutants who lost their powers as a result of [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]].<ref>''New Avengers'' #18</ref>\n\nFollowing the creation of the Mutant Nation of Krakoa, Slipstream was somehow repowered and became a loyal citizen of Krakoa and is seen helping fight off the Russian Armed Forces that attacked the island.<ref>''X-Force'' (vol. 6) #11</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nSlipstream can teleport via a funnel of trans-spatial energy also called a Warp Wave, to any place on earth. Warp Waves use superstrings to connect any two locations on Earth. He is not only able to teleport himself but also can take other people through the Warp Wave, but requires increased concentration to maintain the wave when traveling with others. Sensitivity to displacement energy signatures enable him to track other teleportation effects back to their origin from residual energies and after detecting this, he could use the warp wave to travel to their location. He usually navigates with the use of a shortened metal surfboard.\n\n==Other versions==\n===X-Men: The End===\nIn ''[[X-Men: The End]]'', a title presenting one possible future of the X-Men, Slipstream works freely for the slavers. It is eventually revealed that he is seemingly controlled by [[Cassandra Nova]]. His powers have also further developed to the point that he can now transverse the warp-wave across inter-galactic distances.<ref>''X-Men: The End'' #1-6</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n{{expand section|date=September 2017}}\n[[Comic Book Resources]] placed him as one of the superheroes Marvel wants you to forget.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Gary|title=15 Superheroes Marvel Wants You To Forget|url=http://www.cbr.com/superheroes-marvel-wants-you-to-forget/|website=CBR|access-date=2 September 2017|date=20 August 2017}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://uncannyxmen.net/characters/slipstream UncannyXmen.net Character Profile on Slipstream]\n\n{{X-Men characters}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Slipstream (Comics)}}\n[[Category:Australian superheroes]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 2001]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Chris Claremont]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Salvador Larroca]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters who can manipulate reality]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters who can manipulate time]]\n[[Category:Fictional extraterrestrial\u2013human hybrids in comics]]\n[[Category:Fictional people from Queensland]]\n[[Category:Fictional surfers]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics aliens]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics male superheroes]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics mutants]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters who can teleport]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters who have mental powers]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics hybrids]]\n\n[[it:Slipstream (personaggio)]]"}]}}}}
