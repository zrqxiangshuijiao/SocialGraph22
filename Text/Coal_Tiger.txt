The character first appeared in ''The Avengers'' #355. He also appeared in the [[Marvel Comics 2|MC2]] series ''[[A-Next]]''.

When a racist team of villains called [[Soldiers of the Serpent]] attacked T'Challa's friend N'Kano (who was on a diplomatic mission for [[Wakanda (Marvel Comics)|Wakanda]] in New York), [[A-Next]] tried to save him. As the Serpents battled with the heroes of A-Next, T'Challa's son T'Chaka II charged into battle. While [[A-Next#Mainframe|Mainframe]] tried to convince the youth to leave the battle, T'Chaka II [[shapeshifting|shapeshifted]] into a feral black [[werecat]] called the \"Coal Tiger\". Coal Tiger's bestial abilities were able to turn the tide in A-Next's favor.
