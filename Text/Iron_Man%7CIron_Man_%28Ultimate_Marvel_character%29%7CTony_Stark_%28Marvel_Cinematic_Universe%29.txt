The character was co-created by writer and editor [[Stan Lee]], developed by scripter [[Larry Lieber]], and designed by artists [[Don Heck]] and [[Jack Kirby]]. The character made his [[first appearance]] in ''[[Tales of Suspense]]'' #39 ([[cover date]]d March 1963), and received his own title in ''[[Iron Man (comic book)|Iron Man]]'' #1 (May 1968). Also in 1963, the character founded the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] alongside [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], [[Hank Pym|Ant-Man]], [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]] and the [[Hulk]].\n\nA wealthy American [[business magnate]], [[playboy (lifestyle)|playboy]], [[Philanthropy|philanthropist]], [[inventor]] and ingenious [[scientist]], '''Anthony Edward Stark''' suffers a severe chest injury during a kidnapping. When his captors attempt to force him to build a [[weapon of mass destruction]], he instead creates a [[Iron Man's armor|mechanized suit of armor]] to save his life and escape captivity. Later, Stark develops his suit, adding weapons and other technological devices he designed through his company, [[Stark Industries]]. He uses the suit and successive versions to protect the world as Iron Man. Although at first concealing his true identity, Stark eventually publicly reveals himself to be Iron Man.\n\nInitially, Iron Man was a vehicle for Stan Lee to explore [[Cold War]] themes, particularly the role of American technology and industry in the fight against [[communism]]. Subsequent re-imaginings of Iron Man have transitioned from Cold War motifs to contemporary matters of the time.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.blastr.com/2013-4-30/little-known-sci-fi-fact-stan-lee-thought-marvel%E2%80%99s-readers-would-hate-iron-man-first|title= Little-known sci-fi fact: Stan Lee thought Marvel's readers would dislike Iron Man (at first)|first= Mike|last= Lee|date= April 30, 2013|publisher= [[Syfy|Blastr]]|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20151117105313/http://www.blastr.com/2013-4-30/little-known-sci-fi-fact-stan-lee-thought-marvel%E2%80%99s-readers-would-hate-iron-man-first|archive-date= November 17, 2015|url-status= dead|access-date= May 7, 2015|quote= In the years following his debut, Iron Man fought against the tyranny of communism, corporate crime, terrorism and alcoholism as a \"second-tier\" Marvel hero, despite always being a popular character amongst readers.}}</ref>\n\nThroughout most of the character's publication history, Iron Man has been a founding member of the superhero team the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and has been featured in several incarnations of his own various comic book series.

Hughes was an icon both of American individualism and of the burdens of fame.<ref name=\"JournalofPopCulture\">{{cite journal|last = Genter|first = Robert|title = 'With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility:' Cold War Culture and the Birth of Marvel Comics|journal = [[The Journal of Popular Culture]]|volume = 40|issue = 6|pages = 953\u2013978 and 965\u2013969|publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell]]|date = December 2007|location= Hoboken, New Jersey|doi = 10.1111/j.1540-5931.2007.00480.x}}</ref>\n\nHistorian Robert Genter, in ''[[The Journal of Popular Culture]]'', writes that Tony Stark specifically presents an idealized portrait of the American inventor. Where earlier decades had seen important technological innovations come from famous ''individuals'' (e.g., [[Nikola Tesla]], [[Thomas Edison]], [[Alexander Graham Bell]], the [[Wright brothers]]), the 1960s saw new technologies (including weapons) being developed mainly by the research teams of ''corporations''. As a result, little room remained for the inventor who wanted credit for, and creative and economic control over, their own creations.\n\nIssues of entrepreneurial autonomy, government supervision of research, and ultimate loyalty figured prominently in early ''Iron Man'' stories\u2014the same issues affecting American scientists and engineers of that era.<ref name=\"JournalofPopCulture\"/> Tony Stark, writes Genter, is an inventor who finds motive in his [[emasculated|emasculation]] as an autonomous creative individual. This blow is symbolized by his chest wound, inflicted at the moment he is forced to invent things for the purposes of others, instead of just himself. To Genter, Stark's transformation into Iron Man represents Stark's effort to reclaim his autonomy, and thus his manhood. The character's pursuit of women in bed or in battle, writes Genter, represents another aspect of this effort. The pattern finds parallels in other works of 1960s popular fiction by authors such as \"[[Ian Fleming]] (creator of [[James Bond]]), [[Mickey Spillane]] ([[Mike Hammer]]), and [[Norman Mailer]], who made unregulated sexuality a form of authenticity.\"<ref name=\"JournalofPopCulture\"/>\n\n===Solo series===\nAfter issue #99 (March 1968), the ''Tales of Suspense'' series was renamed ''Captain America''.

A boy genius, he enters [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] at the age of 15 to study [[engineering]] and later receives master's degrees in engineering and physics. After his parents are killed in a car accident, he inherits his father's company.\n\nStark is injured by a booby trap and captured by enemy forces led by [[Wong-Chu]]. Wong-Chu orders Stark to build weapons, but Stark's injuries are dire and shrapnel is moving towards his heart. His fellow prisoner, [[Ho Yinsen]], a [[Nobel Prize]]-winning [[physicist]] whose work Stark had greatly admired during college, constructs a [[magnetism|magnetic]] chest plate to keep the shrapnel from reaching Stark's heart. In secret, Stark and Yinsen use the workshop to design and construct a [[Iron Man's armor|suit]] of [[powered exoskeleton|powered armor]], which Stark uses to escape. During the escape attempt, Yinsen sacrifices his life to save Stark's by distracting the enemy as Stark recharges. Stark takes revenge on his kidnappers and rejoins the American forces, on his way meeting a wounded American [[United States Marine Corps|Marine]] fighter pilot, [[War Machine|James \"Rhodey\" Rhodes]].\n\nBack home, Stark discovers that the shrapnel fragment lodged in his chest cannot be removed without killing him, and he is forced to wear the armor's chestplate beneath his clothes to act as a regulator for his heart. He must recharge the chestplate every day or else risk the shrapnel killing him. The [[cover-up|cover story]] that Stark tells the news media and general public is that Iron Man is his robotic personal [[bodyguard]], and corporate mascot. To that end, Iron Man fights threats to his company (e.g., [[Communism|Communist]] opponents [[Black Widow (Natasha Romanova)|Black Widow]], the [[Crimson Dynamo]], and the [[Titanium Man]]), as well as independent villains like the [[Mandarin (comics)|Mandarin]] (who becomes his greatest enemy). No one suspects Stark of being Iron Man, as he cultivates a strong public image of being a rich playboy and industrialist. Two notable members of the series's supporting cast, at this point, are his personal chauffeur [[Happy Hogan (comics)|Harold \"Happy\" Hogan]], and secretary [[Pepper Potts|Virginia \"Pepper\" Potts]]\u2014to both of whom he eventually reveals his dual identity. Meanwhile, James Rhodes finds his own niche as Stark's personal pilot, ultimately revealing himself to be a man of extraordinary skill and daring in his own right.\n\nThe series took an anti-Communist stance in its early years, which was softened as public (and therefore, presumably, reader) opposition rose to the [[Vietnam War]].<ref name=\"origins 45\"/> This change evolved in a series of storylines featuring Stark reconsidering his political opinions, and the morality of manufacturing weapons for the U.S. military. Stark shows himself to be occasionally arrogant, and willing to act unethically in order to 'let the ends justify the means'.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.today.com/id/24317684|title= Quiz: Is your 'Iron Man' knowledge iron-clad?|first= Christopher|last= Bahn|date= May 4, 2008|publisher= [[Today.com]]|access-date= December 28, 2010|archive-date= November 13, 2013|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20131113023400/http://www.today.com/id/24317684|url-status= dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://graphicpolicy.com/tag/iron-man/|title= Iron Man Takes Off|date= May 4, 2008|publisher= Graphic Policy|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080513164840/http://graphicpolicy.com/tag/iron-man/|archive-date=May 13, 2008 |url-status=dead|access-date= December 28, 2010}}</ref> This leads to personal conflicts with the people around him, both in his civilian and superhero identities. Stark uses his vast personal fortune not only to outfit his own armor, but also to develop weapons for [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]; other technologies (e.g., [[Quinjet]]s used by [[Avengers (comics)|the Avengers]]); and the image inducers used by the [[X-Men]]. Eventually, Stark's heart condition is publicly discovered when he was summoned for a Congressional hearing and Stark collapsed when his chestpiece's power failed, causing a heart attack. Stark was medically examined, which revealed his hidden equipment, and was hospitalized, forcing Pepper to have Happy don his employer's armor to pose as Iron Man to protect his boss's secret identity.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Lee |first1=Stan |last2=Colan |first2=Gene |title=The Other Iron Man |journal=Tales of Suspense |date=December 1967 |volume= |issue=#84 }}</ref> Eventually, that specific medical issue was resolved with an artificial [[Heart transplantation|heart transplant]], which still required the chestplate for some time to support the replacement organ.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Archie Goodwin (comics)|Goodwin, Archie]]|penciller= Tuska, George|inker= [[Johnny Craig|Craig, Johnny]]|story= What Price Life?!|title= Iron Man|issue= #19|date= November 1969}}</ref>\n\n===1970s and early 1980s===\nStark expands on his armor designs and begins to build his arsenal of specialized armors for particular situations such as for [[Human spaceflight|space travel]]<ref name=\"IronMan142\">{{cite comic| writer= [[David Michelinie|Michelinie, David]]; [[Bob Layton|Layton, Bob]]|penciller= [[John Romita Jr.|Romita Jr., John]]|inker= Layton, Bob|story= Sky Die!|title= Iron Man|issue= 142|date= January 1981}}</ref> and [[stealth technology|stealth]].<ref name=\"DeFalco202\">DeFalco \"1980s\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 202: \"In ''Iron Man'' #152, Iron Man unveiled his all-black stealth armor.\"</ref><ref name=\"IronMan152\">{{cite comic| writer= Michelinie, David; Layton, Bob|penciller= Romita Jr., John|inker= Layton, Bob|story= Escape From Heaven's Hand!|title= Iron Man|issue= 152|date= November 1981}}</ref> Stark also develops a serious dependency on [[alcoholism|alcohol]] in the \"[[Demon in a Bottle]]\" storyline.<ref>{{cite book|last1= Michelinie|first1= David|last2= Layton|first2= Bob|last3= Romita|first3= John Jr.|title = Iron Man: Demon in a Bottle|publisher = Marvel Comics|year = 2006<!-- Date of collected edition -->|page = 176|isbn = 978-0785120438}}</ref> The first time it becomes a problem is when Stark discovers that the national security agency [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] has been buying a controlling interest in his company in order to ensure Stark's continued weapons development for them.

As a result, Stark loses control of Stark International to Stane, becomes a homeless alcoholic vagrant and gives up his armored identity to Rhodes, who becomes the new Iron Man. Eventually, Stark recovers and joins a new startup, Circuits Maximus. Stark concentrates on new technological designs, including building a new set of armor as part of his recuperative therapy. Rhodes continues to act as Iron Man but steadily grows more aggressive and paranoid, due to the armor not having been calibrated properly for his use. Eventually Rhodes goes on a rampage, and Stark has to don a replica of his original armor to stop him. Fully recovered, Stark confronts Stane who has himself designed armor based on designs seized along with Stark International, dubbing himself the 'Iron Monger'. Defeated in battle, Stane, rather than give Stark the satisfaction of taking him to trial, commits suicide.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Dennis O'Neil|O'Neil, Dennis]]|penciller= [[M. D.

His quest to destroy the stolen technology\u2014originally called \"Stark Wars\" but is more commonly known as the \"[[Armor Wars]]\"\u2014severely hurts his reputation as Iron Man. After attacking and disabling a series of minor villains such as [[Stilt-Man]], he attacks and defeats the government operative known as [[Stingray (comics)|Stingray]]. The situation worsens when Stark realizes that Stingray's armor does not incorporate any of his designs. He publicly \"fires\" Iron Man while covertly pursuing his agenda. He uses the cover story of wanting to help disable the rogue Iron Man to infiltrate and disable the armor of the S.H.I.E.L.D. operatives known as the [[Mandroid]]s, as well as the armor of the [[Guardsman (comics)|Guardsmen]]. In the process, Iron Man and Jim Rhodes allow some of the villains in the [[Vault (Marvel Comics)|Vault]] to escape. This leads the [[Federal government of the United States|United States government]] to declare Iron Man a danger and an outlaw, and severely sours Stark's relationship with Steve Rogers ([[Captain America]], who was in his \"Captain\" persona at the time). Iron Man travels to Russia where he inadvertently causes the death of the Soviet [[Titanium Man#Titanium Man II - The Gremlin|Titanium Man]] during a fight. Returning to the U.S., he faces an enemy commissioned by the government named [[Firepower (comics)|Firepower]]. Unable to defeat him head on, Stark fakes Iron Man's demise,<ref>{{Cite book|title=Iron Man #230|publisher=Marvel Comics|year=1988}}</ref> intending to retire the suit permanently. When Firepower goes rogue, Stark creates a new suit, claiming a new person is in the armor.\n\nSoon after, Stark is nearly killed by Kathy Dare, a mentally unbalanced former lover.

The young Stark steals an Iron Man suit in order to aid the Avengers against his older self. The sight of his younger self shocks the older Stark enough for him to regain momentary control of his actions, and he sacrifices his life to stop Kang.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Avengers #395|publisher=Marvel Comics|year=1996}}</ref> The young Stark later builds his own suit to become the new Iron Man and remains in the present day.\n\nDuring the battle with the creature called [[Onslaught (Marvel Comics)|Onslaught]], the teenage Stark dies, along with many other superheroes. [[Franklin Richards (Fantastic Four)|Franklin Richards]] preserves these \"dead\" heroes in the \"[[Heroes Reborn (1996 comic)|Heroes Reborn]]\" pocket universe, in which Stark is once again an adult hero; Franklin recreates the heroes in the pocket universe in the forms he is most familiar with rather than what they are at the present. The reborn adult Stark, upon returning to the normal Marvel Universe, merges with the original Stark, who had died during \"The Crossing\", but was resurrected by Franklin Richards. This new Anthony Stark possesses the memories of both the original and teenage Anthony Stark, and thus considers himself to be essentially both of them. With the aid of the law firm [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Nelson & Murdock]], he regains his fortune and, with Stark Enterprises having been sold to the Fujikawa Corporation following Stark's death, sets up a new company, Stark Solutions. He returns from the pocket universe with a restored and healthy heart. After the Avengers reform, Stark demands a hearing be convened to look into his actions just prior to the Onslaught incident. Cleared of wrongdoing, he rejoins the Avengers.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Avengers Annual 2001|publisher=Marvel Comics|year=2001}}</ref>\n\n===2000s===\nAt one point, Stark's armor becomes sentient despite fail-safes to prevent its increasingly sophisticated computer systems from doing so.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Iron Man|publisher=vol. 3 #27, Marvel Comics|year=2000}}</ref> Initially, Stark welcomes this \"living\" armor for its improved tactical abilities. The armor begins to grow more aggressive, killing indiscriminately and eventually desiring to replace Stark altogether. In the final confrontation on a desert island, Stark suffers another heart attack. The armor sacrifices its own existence to save its creator's life, giving up essential components to give Stark a new, artificial heart. This new heart solves Stark's health problems, but it does not have an internal power supply, so Stark becomes once again dependent on periodic recharging. The sentient armor incident so disturbs Stark that he temporarily returns to using an unsophisticated early model version of his armor to avoid a repeat incident.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Iron Man|publisher=vol. 3 #31.

Her relationship with Stark endures many highs and lows, including infidelity with Stark's rival, Tiberius Stone, in part because the fun-loving Rumiko believes that Stark is too serious and dull.

As Hydra tightens its grip across America, the Tony Stark AI leads a team known as the Underground to find the Cosmic Cubes to restore Rogers to his normal self. When things start to escalate, Tony and his crew go rogue and in search for answers for the Cube. As Iron Man and the Underground search for them they are intercepted by Captain America and his Hydra team. With both teams encountering each other, they are captured by the Ultron/Hank Pym hybrid, who forces both teams to sit at a dinner table. During \"dinner\", Ultron reveals information about the Hydra Avengers \u2013 such as Odinson working with Hydra to reclaim Mjolnir, Scarlet Witch being possessed by Chthon, and Vision being affected by an AI virus. Ultron argues that he is doing this because the Avengers have become less of a family over the years as so many of them jump to obey Captain America or Iron Man, despite past experience confirming that this is not always a good idea, but Tony counters that the only reason the team failed as a family was because of Hank's abuse towards Wasp. Enraged, Ultron is about to kill everyone, but Ant-Man is able to calm him down by arguing that Hank remains his own inspiration. Ultron allows the Underground to leave with the fragment, arguing that neither side should have an advantage over the other. Back in America, Hydra Supreme has put Namor in a position where he will be forced to sign a peace treaty that gives Rogers access to the Cosmic Cube fragment in Atlantis, but Hydra Supreme muses that he is unconcerned about who will acquire the fragments, as he has an inside man in the Underground. After the Mount was attacked by Thor and the resurrected Hulk led by Hydra, the Underground evacuated the civilians thanks to Hawkeye and the rest of the heroes.

Not wanting to prove Tony right, Ultron Pym surrendered to Iron Man and the Avengers.

The armor is invented and worn by Stark (with occasional short-term exceptions). It's also constantly improved upon and Stark develops many specialized versions of the armor. Other people who have assumed the Iron Man identity include Stark's long-time partner and best friend [[War Machine|James Rhodes]];<ref name=\"DeFalco211\">DeFalco \"1980s\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 211: \"Jim was the natural choice to replace [Stark] as Iron Man when Tony's problem's with alcohol prevented him from doing the job.

Other weapons built into various incarnations of the armor include: the uni-beam projector in its chest; pulse bolts (that pick up [[kinetic energy]] along the way; so the farther they travel, the harder they hit); an [[electromagnetic pulse]] generator; and a defensive energy shield that can be extended up to 360 degrees. Other capabilities include: generating ultra-[[freon]] (i.e., a freeze-beam); creating and manipulating [[magnetic field]]s; emitting sonic blasts; and projecting 3-dimensional [[hologram]]s (to create decoys).\n\nIn addition to the general-purpose model he wears, Stark has developed several specialized [[space suit|suits]] for [[spaceflight|space travel]],<ref name=\"IronMan142\" /> [[atmospheric diving suit|deep-sea diving]], [[stealth technology|stealth]],<ref name=\"DeFalco202\" /><ref name=\"IronMan152\" /> and other special purposes. Stark has modified suits, like the Hulkbuster heavy armor. The Hulkbuster armor is composed of add-ons to his so-called modular armor, designed to enhance its strength and durability enough to engage the [[Hulk]] in a fight. A later model, created with the help of [[Odin (Marvel Comics)|Odin]] and the Asgardian metal Uru, is similar to the [[Destroyer (Thor)|Destroyer]]. Stark develops an electronics pack during the Armor Wars that, when attached to armors that use Stark technologies, will burn out those components, rendering the suit useless. This pack is ineffective on later models. While it is typically associated with [[War Machine|James Rhodes]], the War Machine armor began as one of Stark's specialty armors.\n\nThe most recent models of Stark's armor, beginning with the Extremis armor, are now stored in the hollow portions of Stark's bones, and the personal area networking implement used to control it is implanted into his forearm, and connected directly to his [[central nervous system]].\n\nThe Extremis has since been removed,{{issue|date=April 2014}} and he now uses more conventional armors. Some armors still take a liquid form, but are not stored within his body. His Endo-Sym Armor incorporates a combination of the liquid smart-metal with the alien Venom symbiote, psionically controlled by Stark.\n\nPost-''Secret Wars'', Stark uses a more streamlined suit of armor that uses [[nanotechnology]] to shape shift into other armors or weapons.<ref>{{Cite comic|cartoonist = |story = Brian Michael Bendis|title = Invincible Iron Man|volume = 3|issue = #1|date = 7 October 2015|publisher = Dan Buckley|location = |page = |panel = | id = }}</ref>\n\n===Powers===\nAfter being critically injured during a battle with the Extremis-enhanced Mallen, Stark injects his nervous system with modified techno-organic virus-like body restructuring machines (the Extremis process).<ref>{{cite book|last = Ellis|first = Warren|author-link = Warren Ellis|author2=Granov, Adi |author-link2=Adi Granov |title = Iron Man: Extremis|publisher = Marvel Comics|year = 2013|page = 160|isbn = 978-0785183785}}</ref> By rewriting his own biology, Stark is able to save his life, gain an enhanced [[healing factor]], and partially merge with the Iron Man armor, superseding the need for bulky, AI-controlled armors in favor of lighter designs, technopathically controlled by his own brain.

Some components of the armor-sheath are now stored in Tony's body, able to be recalled, and extruded from his own skin, at will.\n\nDuring the \"[[Secret Invasion]]\" storyline the Extremis package is catastrophically shut down by a virus, forcing him again to rely on the previous iteration of his armor, and restoring his previous limitations. Furthermore, Osborn's takeover of most of the few remaining Starktech factories, with Ezekiel Stane systematically crippling the others, limits Tony to the use of lesser, older and weaker armors.<ref>{{cite book|last = Bendis|first = Brian Michael|author2=Yu, Leinil Francis|title = Secret Invasion|publisher = Marvel Comics|year = 2010|page = 288|isbn = 978-0785149170}}</ref>\n\nAfter being forced to \"wipe out\" his brain to prevent Norman Osborn from gaining his information, Tony Stark is forced to have a new arc reactor, of [[Iron Fist (comics)|Rand]] design installed in his chest. The process greatly improves his strength, stamina and intellect. The procedure left him with virtually no autonomic functions: as his brain was stripped of every biological function, Tony is forced to rely on a digital backup of his memories (leaving him with severe gaps and lapses in his long-term memory) and on software routine in the arc reactor for basic stimuli reaction, such as blinking and breathing.<ref>{{cite book|last = Fraction|first = Matt|author2=Larroca, Salvador|title = Invincible Iron Man, Vol. 2: World's Most Wanted, Book 1|publisher = Marvel Comics|year = 2009|page = 152|isbn = 978-0785134138}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last = Fraction|first = Matt|author2=Larroca, Salvador|title = Invincible Iron Man vol. 3: World's Most Wanted, Book 2|publisher = Marvel Comics|year = 2010|page = 160|isbn = 978-0785136859}}</ref> The ''Bleeding Edge'' package of armor and physical enhancement is now equal in power, if not a more advanced, version of the old Extremis tech.<ref name=\"Fraction, Matt 2010\"/>\n\n===Skills===\nTony Stark is an inventive genius whose expertise in the fields of [[mathematics]], [[physics]], [[chemistry]], and [[computer science]] rivals that of [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]], [[Hank Pym]], and [[Hulk|Bruce Banner]], and his expertise in [[electrical engineering]] and [[mechanical engineering]] surpasses even theirs.

His expertise extends to his ingenuity in dealing with difficult situations, such as difficult foes and deathtraps, in which he is capable of using available tools, including his suit, in unorthodox but effective ways. For instance, in Stark's final confrontation with [[Obadiah Stane]], the villain managed to have Stark's companions in an unconscious state in a room with [[motion sensor]]s; when Stark entered the room, Stane warned him that the slightest move would trigger a fatal electrical current to his hostages, thus forcing Stark to stay still and slowly die of dehydration lest he wants his friends to die. However, while Stane was confident that such a trap was inescapable, Stark is able to outwit and defeat its mechanism in seconds, thus freeing the hostages and allowing him to continue the battle against Stane.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=O'Neil |first1=Dennis |last2=Bright |first2=Mark |title=Resolutions |journal=Iron Man |date=November 1986 |volume=1 |issue=200 }}</ref>\n\nHe is well respected in the business world, able to command people's attention when he speaks on economic matters, having over the years built up several multimillion-dollar companies from virtually nothing.

He worked with his father from an early age, and surpassed his father's technical brilliance by the age of 16.  Stark became the key supplier of hi-tech weaponry used to fight mutants, and was on the verge of a technological breakthrough when the Mutant-Human war came to an end.  The suits are powered down to become part of a game called Robo Death Match, a television sport with giant robots fighting each other.  Stark Industries scored its biggest victory when it secured the Sentinel production contracts, pushing major competitor, [[Jason Wyngarde]], out of business.

Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n===Infinity Warps===\nDuring the ''[[Infinity Wars]]'' storyline, where the universe was combined in half, Iron Man was fused with [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] creating '''Iron Hammer'''. Sigurd Stark was the fifth richest person on the world thanks to his genius about technology, however due to his lack of memories before five years, taunted him driving to drink. After going through the Norvegian, he was attacked by some [[Elves (Marvel Comics)#Dark-Elves|Dark Elves]], led by Krimson Kurse (fusion [[Crimson Dynamo]] and [[Kurse]]). He got poisoned by an arrow, slowing killing him and taken by the Elves to aid their other prisoner Eitri (fusion of [[Eitri (comics)|Eitri]] and [[Ho Yinsen]]) in order to build powerful weapons for the Elves. Then, Sigurd became friend with Eitri and together build an [[Iron Man armor|armor]], that prevented the poison from killing Sigurd, along with a [[Mjolnir (comics)|hammer]] in order to escape the Dark Elves. However, during their escape Eitri is killed and after Sigurd defeated the Elves and Krimson Kurse, he discovered that Krimson was his lost friend who had turned into a [[Draugr|Thrall]] to be a servant to Dark Elves and after that he mercy killed his friend. Sigurd then decided to the All-Father on Asgard to seek help into defeating Malekith (fusion of [[Malekith the Accursed|Malekith]] and [[Mandarin (comics)|Mandarin]]) and with the help of his AI assistant H.E.I.M.D.A.L.L.

When travelling, he remembered his old memories: his true name was Stark Odinson, who due to his arrogance, his father Howard Odin (fusion of [[Howard Stark]] and [[Odin (Marvel Comics)|Odin]]) banished his son to Earth where he would learn to how is like to be a mortal. Upon arriving, Malekith had trapped the Aesir and had allied with Madame Hel (fusion of [[Madame Masque]] and [[Hela (comics)|Hela]]) and Stane Odinson (fusion of [[Loki (Marvel Comics)|Loki]] and [[Obadiah Stane]]). Luckily, Iron Hammer was able to defeat Malekith and Odin allowed his son to become a god again. However, Sigurd refused, feeling better as a human.<ref>''Infinity Wars: Iron Hammer'' #1-2.

This leads to the need to groom a replacement.{{issue|date=September 2020}}\n\n===Iron Maniac===\n'''Iron Maniac''' is an evil [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternative universe]] version of Iron Man from Earth-5012. He first appeared in ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'' vol. 3 #2, wearing armor that resembles that of [[Doctor Doom]]'s. He comes from an alternative reality where most of the Avengers were killed when they encountered the vicious alien [[Titannus]] in space. While the team is rescued by the reserve Avengers five years later, it takes another five years to fight back the Trellions, the alien race that has brainwashed Titannus. During that time, a power-hungry [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]] turns his back on the surviving heroes. Scarred for life due to an attack from the [[Human Torch]], Iron Man sets his own operation base in Latveria to \"take over the world to save it from Richards.\" Richards somehow manages to banish him into [[Earth-616]] Other differences between his world and Earth-616 include that there is no [[Spider-Man]], and that [[Hank Pym]] is another version of the [[Hulk]].{{issue|date=February 2013}}\n \nAfter being transported to [[Earth-616]], Iron Maniac fights the Fantastic Four and [[Doctor Strange]], all of whom mistake him for their Doctor Doom. After unmasking himself, they learn his true identity, shortly before he manages to temporarily negate the FF's powers and escape, concluding that he has no reason to trust that they will not turn on him like the FF of his world did. Capturing a recently discovered mutant, the alternative Iron Man attempts to return to his home dimension by using the mutant as a power source, but is attacked by Spider-Man and [[X-23]] as they investigate the situation. After the appearance of [[Captain America]] and [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]], he realizes that he is in an alternative world, but continues to fight the heroes, calling them all 'Richards' lackeys', proclaiming that he cannot trust that they will not turn into 'villains' just as his own former allies did. He is defeated thanks to Spider-Man and X-23's use of their own version of the fastball special to destroy his equipment, shortly after 'warning' the other heroes of the Titannus War (by saying that he would not kill them now because it would be a kindness).{{issue|date=February 2013}}\n\nWhile the alternative Tony Stark is kept locked up and drugged in the [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] [[helicarrier]], he is briefly visited by his counterpart in this universe, although he is unaware of the visit. Shortly after the alternative Stark is transferred to a conventional cell, Titannus soon arrives and fights the heroes, this time confronting a new group of Defenders assembled by Doctor Strange. When Titannus' comatose lover is revived, she tells him that she never loved him and that he was insane, causing Titannus to kill himself. The alternative Iron Man later discovers from Spider-Man and [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] that the Avengers were never massacred in space in this reality because the group had been [[Avengers Disassembled|disassembled]]; as a result, other heroes only encountered Titannus after he had attacked Tokyo in a rage, leaving the heroes who did encounter him less inclined to believe his story and averting the so-called 'Titannus War'.<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' vol. 3 #13. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nStark subsequently broke free from captivity, having immunized himself to the gas that was used to keep him sedated on board the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier. In the process, he gained the unwilling alliance of the [[Life Model Decoy|LMD]] [[Diamondback (Rachel Leighton)|Diamondback]]. Having convinced her that he is the \"real\" Tony, the AU Tony Stark erased her memories, reshaping the former LMD into an advanced suit of armor. This armor, even more advanced than the pre-Extremis suit Iron Man wore at that time, was able to replicate any weapon from the wearer's memory. He subsequently battled Spider-Man, Wolverine, Captain America and [[Luke Cage]], but was only defeated after the sacrifice of rookie hero [[Freedom Ring]], who kept Iron Maniac occupied long enough for Captain America to knock him out with a shield thrown at the back of his neck.<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' vol. 3 #24. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nThe name '''Iron Maniac''' is what he calls himself, due to being the \"sole survivor of a sane world living in a backwards, insane world\".{{issue|date=February 2013}}\n\nIron Maniac is known to be at least partially [[cyborg|cyberized]], with armor plating implanted in his chest (revealed during his escape from the Helicarrier, when he is shot). It is unknown whether the rest of his body is similarly armored or if he possesses other cybernetic enhancements.{{issue|date=February 2013}}\n\nHe has been briefly mentioned as being held in a S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier recently in ''The Irredeemable [[Ant-Man (Eric O'Grady)|Ant-Man]]''.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}\n\n===Iron Man Noir===\nIn ''[[Marvel Noir|Iron Man Noir]]'', Tony Stark is an industrialist in the 1930s. He is also an adventurer, whose exploits are recorded in ''Marvels: A Magazine Of Men's Adventure''. He is initially accompanied by his associate [[War Machine|James Rhodes]], his personal assistant [[Madame Masque|Giulietta Nefaria]] and his biographer Vergil Munsey. When Nefaria is revealed as working with the [[Nazi]]s (specifically [[Baron Zemo]] and [[Baron von Strucker]]) and Vergil is killed, their role in the story is taken by Stark's new biographer [[Pepper Potts]]. His heart having been damaged on an earlier adventure, Stark keeps it going with repulsor technology installed and recharged by Stark Industries engineer [[Edwin Jarvis]].<ref>''Iron Man: Noir'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nWhile investigating a mysterious power source in the ruins of [[Atlantis]], Pepper Potts gets kidnapped by the Nazis and taken to their stronghold in Norway. To rescue her, Stark and Rhodes don suits of bulky power armor built by Jarvis, but are shocked to discover that 'Baron Zemo' is actually Tony's missing father [[Howard Stark]], brainwashed by a unique chemical compound to serve the Nazis. Despite his depleted power supply, Tony manages to destroy the various suits of armor that Zemo had built for the Nazis, concluding that his father had died long ago, before returning to the USA.<ref>''Iron Man: Noir'' #1-4. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n===Mangaverse===\nIn the [[Marvel Mangaverse]] reality, Tony Stark creates the original armor together with Dr. [[Ho Yinsen]] and acts as Iron Man for a time, but eventually vanishes after a battle with [[Namor]], the Submariner. He is succeeded by Antoinette (Toni) Stark, his twin sister, a former agent of SHIELD, who turns Iron Man into a massive operation - a veritable army of Iron Men in many forms, with herself as Iron Woman. After she dies in battle against the [[Hulk]], Tony Stark reveals himself again; he has gone underground after spinal cancer reduced him to a disembodied head hooked up to a life support system. However, he has designed a new armor, and a body that he can integrate with.{{issue|date=February 2013}}\n\nHe also had designed four massive vehicles for the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] of his world to use, which could combine (in a manner resembling old-fashioned combining super robots like [[Combattler V]] and [[Voltes V]]) into a skyscraper-sized Iron Man-[[mecha]] (dubbed Ultimate Iron Man in its first appearance, then the Iron Avenger in its battle with the Hulk, and finally \"the Avenger's mecha\" in Volume 2 of the series). Unfortunately it was quickly destroyed by that world's Hulk. Apparently, however, it was rebuilt again by the time of the second volume, this time as a single robotic unit without transformation (or, if it was capable of transformation, it was never demonstrated). This unit helped fight off the giant [[Galactus]] spores, but was later destroyed, along with most of the Avengers, single-handedly by the Mangaverse version of [[Dr. Doom]].{{issue|date=February 2013}}\n\n===Marvel Adventures===\nThe ''[[Marvel Adventures]]'' Iron Man is very similar to the [[Earth-616]] Iron Man, but with some changes. Instead of suffering damage to his heart due to a booby trap in Vietnam, Tony Stark's heart was damaged when an experimental plane he was flying was brought down by [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]] A.I.M. wanted Stark to build weapons and devices for them. Dr. [[Gia-Bao Yinsen]] aided Tony in escaping AIM, but Yinsen died saving his country from A.I.M. Iron Man does not seem to have problems with alcoholism, since the [[Marvel Adventures]] is aimed at a younger demographic. Iron Man's armor resembles his Extremis armor although Iron Man has other armors that fit over his regular armor, as in the case of his underwater armor.{{issue|date=February 2013}}\n\n===Marvel Apes===\nThe version of Iron Man appearing in the ''Marvel Apes'' mini-series is a mandrill, appropriately being named the Iron Mandrill.  He is a member of the Apevengers. At one point, he is attacked by the zombified Wasp of the Marvel Zombies universe and infected, though he is later apparently cured when these events are undone via time travel.<ref>''Marvel Apes'' #1-5. Marvel Comics.</ref><ref>''Marvel Apes: Prime Eight''</ref><ref>''Marvel Zombies: Evil Evolution''. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n===Marvel Zombies===\nThere are different versions of Iron Man in the ''[[Marvel Zombies]]'' series:\n\n====The first series====\nIn the ''[[Marvel Zombies]]'' universe, Tony Stark has been infected by the zombie virus.  Alongside a horde of starving undead superhuman zombies, Iron Man attacks the [[Silver Surfer]]. The attack is successful, but one of the Surfer's energy bolts hits Iron Man's lower torso, cutting him in half. The zombie \"survives\" this wound and later gains cosmic powers (including flight) by eating part of the Surfer's corpse. When [[Galactus]] arrives, Iron Man and the five other surviving zombies devour him.  They are able to absorb Galactus' power, and call themselves \"The Galacti\".{{issue|date=February 2013}}\n\n====Marvel Zombies 2====\nHe also appears in ''Marvel Zombies 2'', one of the small group of super-powered zombies that have eaten their way across all known space. Here Stark has had his entire lost lower body replaced with cybernetics. He also appears to have forgotten he had some design in the machine which opened a link to the [[Ultimate Marvel|Ultimate Universe]].  He was shocked to see Forge, one of the surviving X-Men, wearing his Mark I [[Iron Man's armor|armored suit]]. The zombified [[Hulk]] kills Iron Man when he stomps through the armor, forcing Tony Stark's flesh and blood through any openings left in the armor. However Iron Man had recently revived next issue, but only as a cameo, on Marvel Zombies 3.{{issue|date=July 2013}}\n\n====Marvel Zombies Return====\nIn the final issue of ''Marvel Zombies 2'', the remaining zombies are transported to another universe. At the point where the zombies reach this new reality, the period is nearly identical to the one where Tony Stark was an alcoholic. Zombie Giant Man infects [[Happy Hogan (comics)|Happy Hogan]], [[Pepper Potts]] and a number of other people at [[Stark Industries]]. A drunken Tony Stark lacks the will power to become Iron Man despite Pepper Potts' requests, so [[War Machine#Marvel Zombies|James Rhodes]] dons the suit to save him. Crucial to fate of the [[multiverse]] are the [[Nanorobotics|nanites]] that Stark has accidentally created, which destroy damaged flesh and tissue as a cure for cancer, and prove to be a potent weapon against the zombies. This was grafted onto [[Flint Marko]]'s body. He sacrifices himself to kill several zombies in Stark Tower, with Rhodes permanently succeeding him in the role of Iron Man.<ref>''Marvel Zombies Return'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> His nanites are then used by his successor, now a member of the [[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]], years later to kill the remaining super-powered zombies and end the inter-dimensional zombie threat.<ref>''Marvel Zombies Return'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n===MC2===\nIn the alternative future of [[Marvel Comics 2|MC2]], Tony Stark retires after the loss of many heroes in battle, but eventually creates the armored computer program [[Mainframe (comics)|Mainframe]], which joins the next generation of [[A-Next|Avengers]].{{issue|date=February 2013}}\n\n===Mini Marvels===\n{{cleanup|section|reason=unencyclopedic summation|date=December 2012}}\nIron Man is a recurring character in \"[[Mini Marvels]]\".

Prior to the Fireworks, Stark is unexceptional, but he then becomes a technological genius. His discoveries revitalise his father's company, Stark Industries, and are \"five years ahead of everything everyone else is working on\". There are suggestions that he is capable of more, but is not making all of his discoveries public.{{issue|date=February 2013}}\n\nStark's transformation is noticed by the National Security Agency's [[Project Spitfire]], which is discreetly monitoring the [[superhuman]]s created by the Fireworks. In March 1959, Stark's plane crashes in North Vietnam and he is imprisoned. He escapes by constructing an Iron Man suit from \"spare parts\" and flying out of the country.{{issue|date=February 2013}}\n\nOn April 4, 1959, when he returns to the US, the NSA takes Stark to a San Diego naval base, ostensibly to debrief him.

Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n===''Ruins''===\nIn the two issue [[Warren Ellis]] series ''[[Ruins (comics)|Ruins]]'', Tony Stark is a rich industrialist who supplied weapons for the US military in an attempt to win the [[Vietnam War]]. This version of Iron Man was injured while mediating between US forces and pro-secessionist Californians by a piece of shrapnel thrown by the National Guard. This embittered Stark who formed a revolutionary cell named the Avengers. This version of Iron Man was betrayed by [[Scarlet Witch]] who provided the United States military information to crush the Avengers.

Venom sprays Tony with Norman Osborn's Green Goblin formula, freeing Tony from the Queen, but slowly making him insane. He modifies Norman's armor and becomes the '''Iron Goblin''' to aid the resistance. When they are surrounded by a number of Man-Spiders (including Giant Man) with few means of escape, Tony sacrifices himself using the Black Knight's [[Ebony Blade]] so he can aid them and die before the Goblin formula completely takes him over.<ref>''Spider-Island'' #1-5.

With a life expectancy anywhere between six months and five years, he chose to become a [[philanthropist]] and [[superhero]], deciding to use the remaining time he has left to live, for a noble purpose. Another major difference from his mainstream counterpart is that this version of Iron Man has an [[Italians|Italian]] mother hence why he is called \"Antonio\".\n\nWhile the character is yet to be featured in his own ongoing series, Stark's early life and origins were initially explored in the ''[[Ultimate Iron Man]]'' miniseries written by science fiction author [[Orson Scott Card]]. However, this origin story is no longer considered canon in the Ultimate Marvel Universe and was retconned as only being a fictional Japanese [[anime]] version.<ref>''Ultimate Avengers VS New Ultimates'' issue 2</ref> On the other hand, the character's adult years have been covered mainly by [[Mark Millar]] (in his ''Ultimates'' work) and [[Warren Ellis]].\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n===''Ultimates''===\nIn the limited series ''[[The Ultimates (comic book)|The Ultimates]]'', when Tony Stark first hears that [[Ultimate Nick Fury|Nick Fury]] is assembling a team of superheroes, he volunteers his services. After helping defeat the [[Ultimate Hulk|Hulk]], Stark develops a friendship with [[Ultimate Thor|Thor]] and [[Ultimate Captain America|Steve Rogers]]. Though he has many great accomplishments, during the first volume of the Ultimates, he remains unsure of himself, clearly shown when he's heavily beat down and throws up in his own helmet. He acts arrogant, but also constantly doubts his own abilities. In the last issue he seems to decide that he can't continue fighting until a soldier asks, \"If you don't do it, who will?\". Later, he fights against the [[Ultimate X-Men|X-Men]] in ''[[Ultimate War]]'', captures the [[Rhino (comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Rhino]] in ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]'', and fights along with [[Spider-Man]] himself in the ''[[Ultimate Six]]'' storyline.\n\nStark also appears in ''[[Ultimate Wolverine vs. Hulk]]'', where he supports [[Ultimate Wolverine|Wolverine]] being sent to kill Bruce Banner. Stark also criticizes the law being used to stop the Hulk, during which he mockingly suggests creating a Superhero Registration Law referencing the mainstream Stark's support of the Superhero Registration Act. The ''[[Ultimate Galactus trilogy]]'' also shows the first signs of an early friendship between Stark and [[Maker (Reed Richards)|Reed Richards]] (despite the age difference), in addition to him successfully sneaking aboard a [[Kree]] spacecraft in ''Ultimate Secret'', and killing a [[Silver Surfer]] clone in ''Ultimate Extinction''.\n\n===''The Ultimates 2''===\nIn ''[[The Ultimates 2]]'', Tony Stark quickly falls in love and proposes to Natasha Romanova. Just prior to proposing, Stark gives her a black suit of armor, almost identical to his own. The flight test of the suit includes flying over her homeland, where Stark had paid the three million inhabitants of her hometown to stand in a field, spelling out his proposal, which she immediately accepts. When the Liberators invade America, Natasha shoots [[Edwin Jarvis]] and then tries to get Stark, at gunpoint, to transfer much of his fortune to her. However, Stark has ultimate control of the nanites in her bloodstream that allows her to interface with her armor. Using these nanites, Stark incapacitates Romanova and retrieves the enemy plans from her mind with the intention of fighting back against the Liberators. He takes \"Iron Man 6\", a massive [[helicarrier]]-sized ship armed with dozens of laser cannons and machine guns, and wipes out the air force of the Liberators in Washington, D.C. (as well as his opposite Liberator number [[Crimson Dynamo#Ultimate Marvel|Crimson Dynamo]]). He then heads to New York to aid the heroes there. After the battle Stark agrees to finance the now independent Ultimates, and seemingly very quickly gets over Natasha's betrayal with the help of a pretty blonde.\n\n===''Ultimates 3'' and ''Ultimate Human''===\n''[[Ultimate Power]]'' marks the first appearance of the independent Ultimates, fighting against an alternate universe [[Squadron Supreme]]. This soon follows with the start of ''[[Ultimates 3]]'' which sees Stark becoming a full-blown alcoholic. A [[sex tape]] that he made with Natasha during their time together also makes it into the public, causing a [[Public relations|PR]] nightmare for the rest of the Ultimates. In ''[[Ultimate Human]]'', which was published around the same time, the focus is on Bruce Banner as he pleads with Stark to cure him of his Hulk affliction just before ''[[Ultimatum (Ultimate Marvel)|Ultimatum]]'', which dealt with Magneto's attempt at complete destruction.\n\n===''New Ultimates'' and ''Ultimate Armor Wars''===\nAfter ''Ultimatum'', the ''[[Ultimate Comics: Armor Wars]]'' mini-series featured Iron Man racing across the world to find his stolen armor in order to save the remains of his enterprise. In ''[[Ultimate Comics: New Ultimates]]'', he began a relationship with [[Carol Danvers#Ultimate Marvel|Carol Danvers]] and fought against the returning Loki. In the pages of ''[[Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man]]'', he was also involved with Captain America and Thor in training Spider-Man to become a better hero. During this time, his brother [[List of Marvel Comics characters: S#Gregory Stark|Gregory Stark]] became the new financial manager for the new [[Ultimate Comics: Avengers|Avengers]] team in ''[[Ultimate Comics: Avengers]]'', which also featured [[War Machine#Ultimate Marvel|Rhodey]] (Tony's former best friend) and a new Black Widow.\n\n===''Ultimate Comics: The Ultimates''===\nIn ''[[Ultimate Comics: The Ultimates]]'', Tony Stark is among the central characters and a leading member of the Ultimates. In \"The Republic is Burning\", he saves a now mortal Thor from the destruction of Asgard. With his [[Asgard (comics)|Asgardian]] brethren exterminated by the Children of Tomorrow and Yggdrasil drained of the Odinforce, Thor is no longer a God and Stark takes it upon himself to help Thor resume his role as a God of Thunder. He reveals that he has been keeping Thor's harness and hammer (pieces of EUSS technology that gave him his powers in ''The Ultimates'' and ''The Ultimates 2'') and gives it back to the mortal Thor, with some modifications. Stark joins Nick Fury's latest Ultimates roster alongside Thor, Spider-Woman, Hawkeye, Black Widow and Falcon.\n\nFollowing the reunification of the United States, Tony Stark builds a new red-white-and-blue version of his Iron Man armor and goes by the name \"'''[[Iron Patriot]]'''\". The armor is badly damaged in a confrontation with the Dead Hand Hydra terrorist group, and is later cut in half during repairs by Black Knight.\n\n===''Ultimate Comics: X-Men''===\nIn ''[[Ultimate Comics: X-Men]]'', following the establishment of the mutant nation of Utopia, Tony Stark is appointed as a liaison between Utopia and the United States by President Steve Rogers. Within Utopia, Stark assumes the role of business affairs and military consultant for the fledgling nation. With Kitty's help, he fakes an explosion in one of Utopia's greenhouses that seemingly destroys the 'super seed' developed by the mutants. Later he promises Kitty that once the attention has shifted away from Utopia, he will start releasing the seeds through back channels and have them freely distributed in accordance to Kitty's wishes.\n\n===Return===\nWhen [[Maker (Reed Richards)|Maker]] collaborated with [[High Evolutionary]] to destroy the Superflow that kept the different universes separate in order to merge them into one reality, the Ultimates members Captain America, Iron Man, Giant-Man, Wasp, and Hulk were revived where they were to help [[Eternity (comics)|Eternity]] fight the [[Celestials (comics)|First Firmament]].<ref>''Ultimates 2'' Vol. 2 #9</ref> When [[Ultimates (2015 team)|Earth-616's version of the Ultimates]] arrived on Counter-Earth to confront Maker about his actions, he ordered the Earth-1610 Ultimates to attack. As both versions of Ultimates concluded that there is no reason to fight each other, Maker killed the Earth-1610 Captain America for disobeying his orders. Upon Maker being defeated, both Ultimates helped Eternity to defeat the First Firmament. Afterwards, Ultimate Iron Man and the remaining members of the Earth-1610 Ultimates left to pursue Maker.<ref>''Ultimates 2'' #100</ref>\n\n==Other versions==\n===Secret Wars (2015)===\nDuring the ''[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]'' storyline, a variation of Ultimate Iron Man resides on the [[Battleworld]] domain known as the Kingdom of Manhattan where he co-exists with a variation of his Earth-616 counterpart.<ref>''Ultimate End'' #1</ref>\n\n==In other media==\n===Film===\n* In ''[[Ultimate Avengers]]'' and ''[[Ultimate Avengers 2]]'', the identity of Iron Man (voiced by [[Marc Worden]]) is a [[composite character]] of both his Earth-616 and Ultimate incarnations where he has the appearance of the Ultimate Marvel version and the shrapnel problem of the Earth-616 version. \n* In ''[[The Invincible Iron Man (film)|The Invincible Iron Man]]'', one of Tony Stark's multiple [[Iron Man]] armors resembles Ultimate Iron Man's original suit.\n* Ultimate Iron Man's character served as a major influence for Iron Man's characterization and personality in ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'' and ''[[Iron Man 2]]''.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=16292 | title=CBR - the World's Top Destination for Comic, Movie & TV news }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/mark-millar-ultimate-universe-100603.html|title = Newsarama &#124; GamesRadar+}}</ref> Also, both Iron Man's Mark VII armor in ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'' and Mark XVII \"Heartbreaker\" armor in ''[[Iron Man 3]]'' resemble Ultimate Iron Man's original armor.\n* Iron Man uses a variation of his armor in ''[[Spider-Man: Homecoming]]'' which resembles the armor used by Ultimate Iron Man. The film also borrows concepts from the comics, like Tony's mentor-mentee relationship with Peter which was established in ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'', but unlike the comics, his mentor-mentee relationship evolves into a father-son relationship.\n\n===Video games===\n* Ultimate Iron Man's original armor is one of Iron Man's alternate costumes in ''[[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance]]'', ''[[Iron Man (video game)|Iron Man]]'', ''[[Iron Man 2 (video game)|Iron Man 2]]'', ''[[Iron Man 3: The Official Game|Iron Man 3]]'' and ''[[Marvel's Avengers (video game)|Marvel's Avengers]]''.<ref>{{cite web |last=Aguilar |first=Matthew |date=February 28, 2021 |url=https://comicbook.com/gaming/news/marvels-avengers-reveals-ultimate-iron-man-skin/ |title=Marvel's Avengers Reveals Ultimate Iron Man Skin |website=Comic Book |access-date=April 2, 2021 }}</ref>\n* Ultimate Iron Man appears with [[The Ultimates]] after Spider-Man battles with Green Goblin in ''[[Spider-Man: Battle for New York]]''.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Ultimates]]\n* [[Ultimate Iron Man]]\n* [[Ultimate Human]]\n* [[Ultimate Comics: Armor Wars]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://marvel.wikia.com/wiki/Antonio_Stark_(Earth-1610) Iron Man of Earth-1610] at Marvel Wiki\n\n{{Iron Man}}\n{{Ultimate Marvel}}\n{{Brian Michael Bendis}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Iron Man, Ultimate}}\n[[Category:Characters created by Brian Michael Bendis]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 2001]]\n[[Category:Fictional alcohol abusers]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from New York (state)]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters with cancer]]\n[[Category:Fictional engineers]]\n[[Category:Fictional inventors]]\n[[Category:Fictional Italian American people]]\n[[Category:Fictional scientists]]\n[[Category:Fictional socialites]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics cyborgs]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics superheroes]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics male superheroes]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics titles|Ultimate Iron Man]]\n[[Category:Iron Man|Ultimate Iron Man]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics mutants]]\n[[Category:Ultimate Marvel characters]]\n[[Category:S.H.I.E.L.D. agents]]"}]},"54537218":{"pageid":54537218,"ns":0,"title":"Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"wikitext","*":"{{short description|Fictional character in the Marvel Cinematic Universe}}\n{{redirect|Iron Man (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|the 2008 film|Iron Man (2008 film){{!}}''Iron Man'' (2008 film)}}\n{{pp-vandalism|small=yes}}\n{{Use American English|date=March 2021}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=June 2022}}\n{{Infobox character\n| color              = #AF181F\n| name               = Tony Stark\n| franchise          = [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]]\n| image              = Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark in Avengers Infinity War.jpg\n| caption            = [[Robert Downey Jr.]] as Tony Stark in ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'' (2018)\n| first              = ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'' (2008)\n| last               = ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'' (2019)\n| creator            = \n| based_on           = {{Based on|[[Iron Man]]|[[Stan Lee]]|[[Larry Lieber]]|[[Don Heck]]|[[Jack Kirby]]}}\n| adapted_by         = {{Plainlist|\n* [[Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby|Mark Fergus<br />Hawk Ostby]]\n* [[Art Marcum and Matt Holloway|Art Marcum<br />Matt Holloway]]\n}}\n| portrayer          = {{Plainlist|\n* [[Robert Downey Jr.]]\n* Davin Ransom (young)<ref>{{Cite web |date=May 3, 2010 |first=Aaron |last=Claverie |title=Temecula: 6-year-old plays young Tony Stark in 'Iron Man 2' |url=https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/sdut-temecula-6-year-old-plays-young-tony-stark-in-2010may03-story.html |work=[[The San Diego Union-Tribune]] |access-date=May 23, 2022 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20220523235758/https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/sdut-temecula-6-year-old-plays-young-tony-stark-in-2010may03-story.html |archive-date=May 23, 2022}}</ref>\n}}\n| voice              = [[Mick Wingert]] (''[[What If...?

Stark is initially depicted as an [[industrialist]], [[genius]] [[inventor]], and [[Playboy lifestyle|playboy]] who is [[CEO]] of [[Stark Industries (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Stark Industries]]. Initially the chief weapons manufacturer for the [[U.S. military]], he has a change of heart and redirects his technical knowledge into the creation of [[Iron Man's armor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|mechanized suits of armor]] which he uses to defend against those that would threaten peace around the world. He becomes a founding member and leader of the [[Avengers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Avengers]]. Following his failed [[Ultron (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Ultron Program]], the internal conflict within the Avengers due to the [[Sokovia Accords]], and [[Thanos (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thanos]] successfully erasing half of all life in [[the Blip]], Stark retires, marries [[Pepper Potts (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Pepper Potts]], and they have a daughter named [[Morgan Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Morgan]]. However, Stark rejoins the Avengers on a final mission to undo Thanos' actions. He creates [[time travel]], and the Avengers successfully restore trillions of lives across the universe. However, Stark inevitably sacrifices his life to defeat Thanos and his army. Stark chooses [[Peter Parker (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Peter Parker]] as a successor.\n\nStark is one of the central figures of the MCU, having appeared in eleven films as of 2022. The character and Downey's performance have been credited with helping to cement the MCU as a multi-billion-dollar franchise, with Stark's evolution often being considered the defining arc of the series.<ref name=\"BusinessInsider\" />\n\n[[#Alternate versions|Alternate versions]] of Stark from within the [[Multiverse (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|MCU multiverse]] appear in the animated series ''[[What If...? (TV series)|What If...?]]'' (2021), voiced by [[Mick Wingert]], reprising his role from previous non-MCU animated media.\n\n==Concept and creation==\nTony Stark first premiered as a [[comic book]] character, in ''[[Tales of Suspense]]'' #39 ([[cover date]]d March 1963), a collaboration among editor and story-plotter [[Stan Lee]], scripter [[Larry Lieber]], story-artist [[Don Heck]], and cover-artist and character-designer [[Jack Kirby]].<ref name=\"DeFalco\" /> Lee wanted to create the \"quintessential capitalist\", a character that would go against the spirit of the times and Marvel's readership.<ref name=\"Excelsior160\" /> Lee based this playboy's looks and personality on [[Howard Hughes]],<ref name=\"MaskGameInformer\" /> as \"one of the most colorful men of our time. He was an inventor, an adventurer, a multi-billionaire, a ladies' man and finally a nutcase.\"<ref name=\"Soapbox\" /> The character's original costume was a bulky gray armored suit, replaced by a golden version in the second story (issue #40, April 1963), and redesigned as sleeker, red-and-golden armor in issue #48 (Dec. 1963) by [[Steve Ditko]].<ref name=\"SigningSession\" /> Lee and Kirby included Iron Man in ''[[The Avengers (comic book)|The Avengers]]'' #1 (Sept. 1963) as a founding member of the superhero team. In the mid-2000s, with a number of movies having been made from other Marvel properties licensed to other studios, [[Kevin Feige]] realized that Marvel still owned the rights to the core members of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], which included Iron Man. Feige, a self-professed \"fanboy\", envisioned creating a shared universe just as creators Stan Lee and Jack Kirby had done with their comic books in the early 1960s.<ref name=\"BostonApril2012\" />\n\n[[Jon Favreau]], who was selected to direct the first ''Iron Man'' film, felt Downey's past made him an appropriate choice for the part,<ref name=\"DowneyUSAToday\" /> and that the actor could make Stark a \"likable asshole,\" but also depict an authentic emotional journey once he won over the audience.<ref name=\"FavreauWonderCon2008\" /> Ultimately however, Downey ended up being the choice the studio made for the first character in their ever-expansive cinematic universe. Favreau was also attracted to Downey from his performance in ''[[Kiss Kiss Bang Bang]]'' (2005), with Downey frequently conversing with that film's director, [[Shane Black]], about the script and dialogue in ''Iron Man''.<ref name=\"KissKissBangBang\" />\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n<!--References recommended but not necessary per [[WP:PLOTCITE]]-->\n\n===Early life===\nAnthony Edward \"Tony\" Stark was born on May 29, 1970, in [[Manhattan, New York]] to [[Howard Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Howard Stark]], a famous genius inventor and businessman, and [[Maria Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Maria Stark]], a [[socialite]] and philanthropist. Growing up under the eye of family butler [[Edwin Jarvis (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Edwin Jarvis]], his life was characterized by a cold and affectionless relationship with his father. Seeing that his son could achieve great things, Howard tried to inspire him with constant talks about his own role in the creation of [[Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Captain America]]. This instead embittered Stark, who felt that his father was taking more pride in his creations than in his family. A brilliant and unique [[child prodigy]], Stark attended [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] for two years starting at age 14, and graduated ''summa cum laude'' at 17.<ref name=\"Guidebook\" />\n\nOn December 16, 1991, when Stark was 21, his parents went away to the [[Bahamas]], but planned to stop at [[the Pentagon]] to deliver [[Features of the Marvel Cinematic Universe#Super Soldier Serum|Super Soldier Serum]] Howard had redeveloped. Instead, both are killed in a car accident\u2014later revealed to be an assassination carried out by the [[Bucky Barnes (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Winter Soldier]], who was mind-controlled by [[Hydra (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Hydra]] to steal the serum.{{refn|name=CivilWar|group=N|As depicted in the 2016 film ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]''.}} As a result, Stark inherited his father's company, becoming CEO of Stark Industries. Over the years, he became well known as a weapons designer and inventor, and lived a [[playboy lifestyle]]. At a [[New Years|New Year's Eve party]] for the [[2000|new millennium]], he attended a conference in [[Bern]] where he met scientists [[Maya Hansen (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Maya Hansen]], inventor of the [[Features of the Marvel Cinematic Universe#Extremis|Extremis]] experimental regenerative treatment, and [[Aldrich Killian (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Aldrich Killian]], rejecting an offer to work for Killian's [[Advanced Idea Mechanics (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Advanced Idea Mechanics]].{{refn|name=IM3|group=N|As depicted in the 2013 film ''[[Iron Man 3]]''.}}\n\n===Becoming Iron Man===\n{{further|Iron Man (2008 film)}}\n[[File:Robert Downey Jr at Comic Con 2007.jpg|thumb|right|185px|Robert Downey Jr. at [[Comic Con]] 2007, after being cast in ''Iron Man''.]]\nIn 2010, Stark travels to [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|war-torn Afghanistan]] with his friend and [[Civil-Military Co-operation#Doctrine|military liaison]] [[Lieutenant Colonel]] [[James Rhodes (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|James Rhodes]] to demonstrate Stark's new \"Jericho\" missile. After the demonstration, the convoy is ambushed and Stark is critically wounded and imprisoned by a terrorist group, the [[Ten Rings (organization)|Ten Rings]]. Fellow captive [[Ho Yinsen (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Ho Yinsen]], a doctor, implants an electromagnet into Stark's chest to keep shrapnel shards from reaching his heart and killing him.\n\nStark and Yinsen secretly build a small, powerful electric generator called an arc reactor to power Stark's electromagnet and a [[Iron Man's armor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|suit of powered armor]]. When the Ten Rings attack the workshop, Yinsen sacrifices himself to divert them while the suit is completed. The armored Stark battles his way out of the cave to find the dying Yinsen, then burns the Ten Rings' weapons in anger and flies away, crashing in the desert. Rescued by Rhodes, Stark returns home to announce that his company will no longer manufacture weapons. In his home workshop, Stark builds a sleeker, more powerful version of his improvised armor suit as well as a more powerful arc reactor.\n\nStark learns that [[Obadiah Stane (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Obadiah Stane]] has been engaged in [[arms trafficking]] to criminals worldwide, and is staging a [[Coup d'\u00e9tat|coup]] to replace him as Stark Industries' CEO. Stark, in his new armor, flies to Afghanistan and saves the villagers. Stane ambushes Stark at his home and takes the arc reactor from his chest, revealing that Stane was responsible for Stark's captivity. Stark manages to get to his original reactor to replace it and defeats Stane. The next day, at a press conference, Stark publicly admits to being \"Iron Man.\"\n\n===Battling Vanko===\n{{further|Iron Man 2}}\nSix months later in 2011, Stark's fame has grown and he uses his Iron Man suit for peaceful means, resisting government pressure to sell his designs. He reinstitutes the Stark Expo to continue his father's legacy, but discovers that the [[palladium]] core in the arc reactor that keeps Stark alive and powers the armor is slowly poisoning him. Growing increasingly reckless and despondent about his impending death, he appoints [[Pepper Potts (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Pepper Potts]] CEO of Stark Industries.\n\nStark competes in the [[Historic Grand Prix of Monaco|Monaco Historic Grand Prix]] and is attacked mid-race by [[Ivan Vanko (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Ivan Vanko]], who wields electrified whips powered by a miniature arc reactor. Stark dons his Mark V armor and defeats Vanko, but the suit is severely damaged. At his birthday party, Stark gets drunk while wearing the Mark IV suit. Rhodes dons Stark's Mark II prototype armor and tries to restrain him. The fight ends in a stalemate, so Rhodes confiscates the Mark II for the [[U.S. Air Force]].\n\nStark discovers a hidden message from his father, a diagram of the structure of a new element, which Stark synthesizes. At the Expo, Stark's rival [[Justin Hammer (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Justin Hammer]] unveils Vanko's armored drones, led by Rhodes in a heavily weaponized version of the Mark II armor. Stark arrives in the Mark VI armor to warn Rhodes, but Vanko remotely takes control of both the drones and Rhodes' armor and attacks Iron Man. Stark and Rhodes together defeat Vanko and his drones. After narrowly saving Pepper Potts from a self-destructing drone, they start a relationship.\n\n===The Battle of New York===\n{{further|The Avengers (2012 film)}}\nIn 2012, when the [[Asgardians (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Asgardian]] [[Loki (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Loki]] arrives and begins menacing Earth, seizing the [[Space Stone|Tesseract]] from a [[S.H.I.E.L.D. (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] facility, Fury activates the [[Avengers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Avengers Initiative]] and Agent [[Phil Coulson]] visits Stark to have him review the research of [[Erik Selvig]] on the Tesseract. In [[Stuttgart]], Steve Rogers and Loki fight briefly until Tony Stark appears in his Iron Man armor, resulting in Loki's surrender. While Loki is being escorted to S.H.I.E.L.D., [[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thor]] arrives and frees him, hoping to convince him to abandon his plan and return to Asgard. After a confrontation with Stark and Rogers, Thor agrees to take Loki to S.H.I.E.L.D.'s flying aircraft carrier, the [[Features of the Marvel Cinematic Universe#Helicarriers|Helicarrier]].\n\nThe Avengers become divided, both over how to approach Loki and the revelation that S.H.I.E.L.D. plans to harness the Tesseract to develop weapons. Agents possessed by Loki attack the Helicarrier, disabling one of its engines in flight, which Stark and Rogers must work to restart. Loki escapes, and Stark and Rogers realize that for Loki, simply defeating them will not be enough; he needs to overpower them publicly to validate himself as ruler of Earth. Loki uses the Tesseract to open a wormhole in New York City above the [[Features of the Marvel Cinematic Universe#Avengers Tower|Avengers Tower]] to allow the [[Chitauri (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Chitauri]] fleet in space to invade. Fury's superiors from the [[World Security Council]] attempt to end the invasion by launching a [[nuclear missile]] at [[Midtown Manhattan]]. Stark intercepts the missile, and in an apparent sacrifice of his own life, takes it through the wormhole toward the Chitauri fleet. The missile detonates, destroying the Chitauri mothership and disabling their forces on Earth. Stark's suit runs out of power, and he falls back through the wormhole but the [[Bruce Banner (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Hulk]] saves him from crashing into the ground. Stark and the other Avengers capture Loki and Thor takes custody of him.\n\n===Pursuing the Mandarin===\n{{further|Iron Man 3}}\nStark develops [[PTSD]] from his experiences during the alien invasion, resulting in [[panic attacks]]. Restless, he builds several dozen Iron Man suits, creating friction with girlfriend Pepper Potts. Seven months after the invasion, [[Happy Hogan (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Happy Hogan]] is badly injured in one of a string of bombings by a terrorist known only as the [[Mandarin (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Mandarin]], Stark issues a televised threat to him, who destroys Stark's [[Malibu, California|Malibu]] home with helicopter gunships. Stark escapes in an Iron Man suit and crashes in rural [[Tennessee]]. His experimental armor lacks sufficient power to return to California, and the world believes him dead.\n\nStark traces the Mandarin to [[Miami]] and infiltrates his headquarters, where he discovers the Mandarin was just an actor named [[Trevor Slattery]]. [[Aldrich Killian (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Aldrich Killian]] reveals himself to be the real Mandarin and captures Stark. He escapes and reunites with Rhodes, discovering that Killian intends to attack [[U.S. President]] Ellis aboard [[Air Force One]]. Stark saves the surviving passengers and crew but cannot stop Killian from abducting Ellis and destroying Air Force One. Killian intends to kill Ellis on an oil platform on live television. On the platform, Stark goes to save Potts \u2013 who had been kidnapped and subjected to [[Features of the Marvel Cinematic Universe#Extremis|Extremis]] \u2014 as Rhodes saves the president. Stark summons his Iron Man suits, controlled remotely by J.A.R.V.I.S., to provide air support. Potts, having survived the Extremis procedure, kills Killian. Stark orders J.A.R.V.I.S. to remotely destroy all of the Iron Man suits as a sign of his devotion to Potts, and undergoes surgery to remove the shrapnel embedded near his heart. He pitches his obsolete chest arc reactor into the sea, musing that he will always be Iron Man.\n\n===Creating Ultron===\n{{Further|Avengers: Age of Ultron}}\nIn 2015, Stark and the Avengers raid a [[Hydra (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Hydra]] facility commanded by [[Wolfgang von Strucker (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Wolfgang von Strucker]], who has been experimenting on siblings [[Pietro Maximoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Pietro]] and [[Wanda Maximoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Wanda Maximoff]] using the scepter previously wielded by Loki. While the team fights outside, Stark enters the lab and finds the scepter, along with Chitauri ships from the Battle of New York under construction. Wanda sneaks up behind him and uses her mind manipulation powers to give him a haunting vision: the death of all the Avengers except him. Stark awakens from the vision and retrieves Loki's scepter.\n\nReturning to the Avengers Tower, Stark and Bruce Banner discover an [[artificial intelligence]] within the scepter's gem, and secretly decide to use it to complete Stark's \"[[Ultron (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Ultron]]\" global defense program. The unexpectedly sentient Ultron eliminates Stark's A.I. J.A.R.V.I.S. and attacks the Avengers. Escaping with the scepter, Ultron builds an army of robot drones, kills Strucker and recruits the Maximoffs, who hold Stark responsible for their parents' deaths by his company's weapons. The Avengers find and attack Ultron in [[Johannesburg]], but Wanda subdues most of the team with personalized, disturbing visions, causing Banner to transform into the Hulk and rampage until Stark stops him with his anti-Hulk armor.\n\nAfter hiding at [[Clint Barton (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Clint Barton]]'s house, Nick Fury arrives and encourages Stark and the others to form a plan to stop Ultron, who is discovered to have forced the team's friend Dr. Helen Cho to perfect a new body for him. Rogers, Romanoff, and Barton find Ultron and retrieve the synthetic body, but Ultron captures Romanoff. Returning to Avengers Tower, the Avengers fight amongst themselves when Stark and Banner secretly upload J.A.R.V.I.S.\u2014who is still operational after hiding from Ultron inside the Internet\u2014into the synthetic body. Thor returns to help activate the body, explaining that the gem on its brow was part of his vision. This \"[[Vision (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Vision]]\" and the Maximoffs, now on their side, accompany Stark and the Avengers to [[Sokovia]], where Ultron has used the remaining [[Vibranium (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|vibranium]] to build a machine to lift part of the capital city skyward, intending to crash it into the ground to cause global extinction. One of Ultron's drones is able to activate the machine. The city plummets, but Stark and Thor overload the machine and shatter the landmass. The Avengers establish a new base in [[upstate New York]], and Stark leaves the team.\n\n===Sokovia Accords and the aftermath===\n{{further|Captain America: Civil War|Spider-Man: Homecoming}}\nIn 2016, [[United States Secretary of State|U.S. Secretary of State]] [[Thaddeus Ross (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thaddeus Ross]] informs the Avengers that the [[United Nations]] (UN) is preparing to pass the [[Features of the Marvel Cinematic Universe#Sokovia Accords|Sokovia Accords]], which will establish UN oversight of the team. The Avengers are divided: Stark supports oversight because of his role in Ultron's creation and Sokovia's devastation, while Rogers has more faith in their judgment than that of a government. Circumstances lead to Rogers and fellow super-soldier [[Bucky Barnes (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Bucky Barnes]]\u2014framed for a terrorist attack\u2014going rogue, along with [[Sam Wilson (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Sam Wilson]], Wanda Maximoff, Clint Barton, and [[Scott Lang (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Scott Lang]]. Stark assembles a team composed of Natasha Romanoff, [[T'Challa (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|T'Challa]], James Rhodes, Vision, and [[Peter Parker (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Peter Parker]] to capture the renegades at [[Leipzig/Halle Airport]]. However, during the battle, Rogers and Barnes are able to escape. Stark learns that Barnes was framed and convinces Wilson to give him Rogers' destination. Without informing Ross, Stark goes to the Siberian Hydra facility and strikes a truce with Rogers and Barnes. They find that the other super soldiers have been killed by [[Helmut Zemo (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Helmut Zemo]], who plays footage that reveals that Barnes killed Stark's parents. Stark turns on them, dismembering Barnes' robotic arm. After an intense fight, Rogers finally manages to disable Stark's Iron Man armor and departs with Barnes, leaving [[Features of the Marvel Cinematic Universe#Captain America's shield|his shield]] behind. Stark returns to New York to work on exoskeletal leg braces to allow Rhodes to walk again. Steve Rogers sends a mobile phone to Stark to keep in contact if needed. When Ross calls informing him that Rogers has broken the others out of the [[Raft (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Raft]], Stark refuses to help.\n\nTwo months later, Peter Parker resumes his high school studies, with Stark telling him he is not yet ready to become a full Avenger. Stark rescues Parker from nearly drowning after an encounter with [[Adrian Toomes (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Adrian Toomes]] and warns Parker against further involvement with the criminals. When another weapon from Toomes malfunctions during a fight with Parker and tears the [[Staten Island Ferry]] in half, Stark helps Parker save the passengers before admonishing him for his recklessness and confiscating his suit. Parker realizes Toomes is planning to hijack a plane transporting weapons from Stark Tower to the team's new headquarters. After Parker thwarts the plan and saves Toomes from an explosion, Stark admits he was wrong about Parker and invites him to become an Avenger full-time, but Parker declines. Potts emerges from a packed press conference, called to make the announcement, and Stark decides to use the opportunity to instead propose to Potts. At the end of the film, he returns the suit to Peter.\n\n===Infinity War===\n{{further|Avengers: Infinity War}}\nIn 2018, Stark and Potts are in a New York City park discussing having children, when Banner, who had disappeared after the Battle of Sokovia, crash-lands at the [[Features of the Marvel Cinematic Universe#New York Sanctum|Sanctum Sanctorum]]. Banner relays a warning to [[Stephen Strange (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Stephen Strange]], [[Wong (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Wong]], and Stark that the mad Titan [[Thanos (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thanos]] plans to use the [[Infinity Stones]] to kill half of all life in the universe. [[Ebony Maw (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Ebony Maw]] and [[Cull Obsidian (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Cull Obsidian]] arrive to retrieve the Time Stone, prompting Strange, Stark, Wong, and Parker to confront them. Although Cull Obsidian is incapacitated, Strange is captured by Maw. Stark and Parker sneak aboard Maw's spaceship to rescue him.\n\nAfter successfully freeing Strange and killing Maw, the trio proceed to Thanos\u2019 home planet [[Features of the Marvel Cinematic Universe#Titan|Titan]], where they meet members of the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]. They form a plan to confront Thanos and remove the Infinity Gauntlet, but Thanos overpowers the group and stabs Stark in the abdomen. Strange surrenders the Time Stone in exchange for Thanos sparing Stark. Thanos takes the stone and departs for Earth, retrieves the final stone, and activates the Infinity Gauntlet. Stark and [[Nebula (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Nebula]], stranded on Titan, watch as Parker and others [[The Blip|are turned to dust]].\n\n===Time Heist and sacrifice===\n{{further|Avengers: Endgame|She-Hulk: Attorney at Law}}\nStark and Nebula are rescued from space by [[Carol Danvers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Carol Danvers]] and returned to Earth, where Stark chooses to retire and raise his daughter [[Morgan Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Morgan]], with Potts. Later, He constructs a secret beach house lab in Mexico for Banner to merge his two identities and spent some time with him including making a [[tiki bar]]. In 2023, when Scott Lang hypothesizes a way to bring back the fallen, the Avengers approach Stark, who initially refuses, considering the idea dangerous. Despite this, he examines the matter privately, discovers [[time travel]], and agrees to help. The Avengers reassemble and plan to retrieve the Infinity Stones from the past to undo Thanos' actions. Traveling to 2012, Stark fails to retrieve the Space Stone following the Battle of New York and instead goes further back to the 1970s to steal it from a S.H.I.E.L.D. facility, where he has a meaningful conversation with a younger version of his father, Howard.\n\nThe Avengers successfully obtain all of the Infinity Stones before returning to the present. The Stones are incorporated into a gauntlet made by Stark, which Banner then uses to resurrect those that were disintegrated by Thanos. However, they are followed by an alternate version of Thanos and his army, who are summoned to 2023 by an alternate version of Nebula. During the ensuing battle, Thanos obtains Stark's gauntlet and the two of them wrestle for control of it. Thanos is able to overpower Stark before attempting another snap but discovers that Stark has transferred the Infinity Stones to his own armor. Stark activates the Gauntlet and uses it to disintegrate Thanos and all of his forces and save the universe, but fatally injures himself in the process. He dies surrounded by Rhodes, Parker, and Potts.\n\n===Legacy===\n{{further|Spider-Man: Far From Home}}\nEight months later, as the world continues to mourn Stark, Parker receives glasses that can access Stark's artificial intelligence E.D.I.T.H., with a message that establishes him as Stark's chosen successor. Parker is however tricked by disgruntled former Stark Industries employee [[Quentin Beck (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Quentin Beck]] into giving him the glasses, as Parker sees him as a more worthy successor. Beck, leading a team of other ex-Stark Industries employees such as [[William Ginter Riva]], and angered at being fired by Stark, seeks to fill the vacancy left by Stark as Iron Man by using the software he developed for Stark, B.A.R.F., to augment illusions of creatures known as the [[Elementals (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Elementals]], presenting himself as a hero known as Mysterio in \"defeating\" them. He uses Stark's glasses to conduct drone attacks in [[London]], targeting Parker. Parker eventually foils Beck's plots and retakes the glasses, and he designs his own Spider-Man suit using technology from Stark Industries, in a similar manner to Stark designing his first Iron Man armor.\n\n==Alternate versions==\n\n=== Losing the Tesseract ===\n{{Further|Avengers: Endgame}}\nIn an alternate 2012, Stark and the Avengers are victorious over Loki during the Battle of New York, however the time traveling Stark and Scott Lang from 2023 alter 2012-Stark's history when they attempt to steal the briefcase containing the Tesseract. As 2012-Stark and 2012-Thor argue with [[Alexander Pierce (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Alexander Pierce]] and S.H.I.E.L.D. agents over custody of Loki and the Tesseract, Lang, using his Ant-Man suit, shrinks down and enters into 2012-Stark's chest arc reactor, pulling a plug that gives him a [[cardiac dysrhythmia]]. 2012-Thor uses [[Mjolnir (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Mjolnir]] to restart the reactor, saving 2012-Stark's life. 2023-Stark obtains the briefcase but loses it when 2012-Hulk smashes through the elevator. The Tesseract falls out, and with 2012-Stark and Thor distracted, Loki picks it up and teleports away.\n\n=== ''What If...?'' ===\n{{see also|What If...? (TV series)}}\n\nSeveral [[parallel universes in fiction|alternate versions]] of Stark appear in the animated series ''What If...?'', in which he is voiced by [[Mick Wingert]].\n\n==== Death of the Avengers ====\n{{Further|What If... the World Lost Its Mightiest Heroes?}}\nIn an alternate 2011, Stark is seemingly killed by Romanoff after she injects him with a temporary antidote to his arc reactor poisoning. Fury later deduces the culprit as [[Hank Pym (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Hank Pym]].\n\n==== Zombie outbreak ====\n{{Further|What If... Zombies?!}}\nIn an alternate 2018, Stark is infected with a quantum virus and is turned into a [[zombie]] along with the Avengers in [[San Francisco]]. When Bruce Banner crash-lands in the New York Sanctum to warn the heroes of Thanos's arrival, a zombified Stark attacks him alongside Stephen Strange and Wong, but is quickly killed by [[Hope van Dyne]].\n\n==== Killmonger deception ====\n{{Further|What If... Killmonger Rescued Tony Stark?}}\nIn an alternate 2010, [[Killmonger (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Erik \"Killmonger\" Stevens]] prevents Stark from being kidnapped by the Ten Rings in Afghanistan. Stark returns to the United States, where Killmonger exposes Obadiah Stane's involvement in the ambush plot, and Stark names him the new [[Chief Operating Officer|COO]] of Stark Industries. Stark and Killmonger build a humanoid combat drone using the [[Vibranium (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|vibranium]] of [[N'Jobu]]'s ring, but Killmonger betrays and kills Stark, setting off a war between the United States and Wakanda.\n\n==== Ultron's conquest ====\n{{Further|What If... Ultron Won?}}\nIn an alternate 2015, Ultron successfully uploads his consciousness into a new vibranium body, becoming powerful enough to kill Stark and most of the Avengers, eradicating all life on Earth.\n\n==== Working with Gamora ====\n{{Further|What If... the Watcher Broke His Oath?}}\nIn an alternate universe, Stark is a close ally of [[Gamora (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Gamora]] after the death of Thanos by her hands. When the Watcher is collecting heroes to fight a multiverse-breaking version of Ultron, he selects the Gamora of this world, but pointedly excludes Stark.\n\n==Appearances==\nRobert Downey Jr. portrays Tony Stark in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] films ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'' (2008),<ref name=\"DowneyCastIM\" /> ''[[Iron Man 2]]'' (2010),<ref name=\"RDJAugust2008\" /> ''The Avengers'' (2012),<ref name=\"DowneyCastAvengers\" /> ''Iron Man 3'' (2013),<ref name=\"DowneyAug2011\" /> ''Avengers: Age of Ultron'' (2015),<ref name=\"DowneyAvengers2&3\" /> ''Captain America: Civil War'' (2016),<ref name=\"DowneyVariety2014\" /> ''Spider-Man: Homecoming'' (2017),<ref name=\"KitTHR2016\" /> ''Avengers: Infinity War'' (2018),<ref name=\"DowneyAvengers2&3\" /> and ''Avengers: Endgame'' (2019).<ref name=\"DowneyVariety2014\" /> In addition, Downey makes an uncredited cameo appearance in ''[[The Incredible Hulk (film)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' (2008).<ref name=\"DowneyTIH\" />\n\nIn ''[[Spider-Man: Far From Home]]'' (2019), Stark appears in archival footage from ''Captain America: Civil War'',<ref name=\"StarkFFH\" /> and also appears via archive footage in the [[Marvel One-Shot]] ''[[The Consultant (film)|The Consultant]]'' (2011).<ref name=\"IGNConsultant\" /> Archival footage of the character also appears in \"[[Glorious Purpose]]\", the first episode of the [[Disney+]] television series ''[[Loki (TV series)|Loki]]''.<ref>{{Cite web |last= |first= |date=2021-06-16 |title=Loki Pays Homage to the MCU's First Film |url=https://www.cbr.com/loki-iron-man-movie-easter-egg/ |access-date=2022-08-04 |website=CBR |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nIn September 2019, ''[[Deadline Hollywood]]'' reported that Downey would appear in ''[[Black Widow (2021 film)|Black Widow]]'' (2021) in his MCU role as Stark;<ref>{{Cite web |last=Boucher |first=Geoff |date=September 13, 2019 |title=Saturn Awards: 'Spider-Man' Star Tom Holland Wins For Third Year In A Row |url=https://deadline.com/2019/09/saturn-awards-2019-winners-list-jon-favreau-kevin-feige-stan-lee-1202734450/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190914235350/https://deadline.com/2019/09/saturn-awards-2019-winners-list-jon-favreau-kevin-feige-stan-lee-1202734450/ |archive-date=September 14, 2019 |access-date=September 15, 2019 |website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]}}</ref> an early version of the script included the end scene from ''Captain America: Civil War'' between Stark and Natasha Romanoff.<ref name=\"PearsonStark\">{{Cite magazine |last=Towers |first=Andrea |date=July 15, 2021 |title='Black Widow' writer confirms there was a Robert Downey Jr. cameo in earlier script |url=https://ew.com/movies/black-widow-writer-confirms-robert-downey-jr-cameo-in-earlier-script-version/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210715223119/https://ew.com/movies/black-widow-writer-confirms-robert-downey-jr-cameo-in-earlier-script-version/ |archive-date=July 15, 2021 |access-date=July 15, 2021 |magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]}}</ref> This was not in the final film, with director [[Cate Shortland]] stating that she and Kevin Feige decided against adding Stark or any other heroes to the film in order for Romanoff to stand on her own,<ref>{{Cite web |last=Shepherd |first=Jack |date=July 9, 2021 |title=Black Widow director reveals why a rumored cameo does not show up |url=https://www.gamesradar.com/black-widow-iron-man-cameo-cate-shortland/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210709162036/https://www.gamesradar.com/black-widow-iron-man-cameo-cate-shortland/ |archive-date=July 9, 2021 |access-date=July 9, 2021 |website=[[GamesRadar]]}}</ref> and screenwriter [[Eric Pearson]] adding that it was determined that the scene did not add anything new to the story.<ref name=\"PearsonStark\" />\n\nStark returns in the Disney+ animated series ''[[What If...?

In contrast, for ''[[Iron Man 2]]'', the duo were given more freedom to conceive of the story for themselves,<ref name=\"RDJAugust2008\" /> in which Stark struggles to keep his technology out of the hands of the government and rival weapons makers. On Stark being a hero, Downey said \"It's kind of heroic, but really kind of on his own behalf. So I think there's probably a bit of an imposter complex and no sooner has he said, 'I am Iron Man &ndash;' that he's now really wondering what that means. If you have all this cushion like he does and the public is on your side and you have immense wealth and power, I think he's way too insulated to be okay.\"<ref name=\"DowneyComicCon\" />\n\n''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'' introduced Stark's role as one of an ensemble of heroes who must come together to defend the Earth from an alien invasion led by the god Loki. Downey initially pushed director [[Joss Whedon]] to make Stark the lead of the 2012 ''Avengers'' film: \"Well, I said, 'I need to be in the opening sequence. I don't know what you're thinking, but Tony needs to drive this thing.' He was like, 'Okay, let's try that.' We tried it and it didn't work, because this is a different sort of thing, the story and the idea and the theme is the theme, and everybody is just an arm of the octopus.\"<ref name=\"BreznicanEW2011\" /> About the character's evolution from previous films, Downey said, \"In ''Iron Man'', which was an origin story, he was his own epiphany and redemption of sorts. ''Iron Man 2'' is all about not being an island, dealing with legacy issues and making space for others... In ''The Avengers'', he's throwing it down with the others\".<ref name=\"Filmink\" /> At the climax of the film, Stark guides a nuclear missile through an interstellar portal to destroy the main alien vessel, demonstrating a willingness to sacrifice his life to save the Earth.<ref name=\"MCUJourneySR\" />\n\nIn ''[[Iron Man 3]]'', Stark struggles to come to terms with his near-death experience in ''The Avengers'',<ref name=\"StarkMCUProfile\" /> suffering from anxiety attacks. On making a third ''Iron Man'' film, Downey said, \"My sense of it is that we need to leave it all on the field\u2014whatever that means in the end. You can pick several different points of departure for that.\"<ref name=\"DowneyAug2011\" /> On following up ''The Avengers'', Downey said they \"tried to be practical, in a post-''Avengers'' world. What are his challenges now?  What are some limitations that might be placed on him? And what sort of threat would have him, as usual, ignore those limitations?\"<ref name=\"ComicCon12Interview\" /> Screenwriter Drew Pearce compared Stark in ''Iron Man 3'' to an American [[James Bond (character)|James Bond]] for both being \"heroes with a sense of danger to them, and unpredictability\" even if Stark was a \"free agent\" instead of an authority figure like Bond. He also likened Tony to the protagonists of 1970s films such as ''[[The French Connection (film)|The French Connection]]'' (1971), where \"the idiosyncrasies of the heroes is what made them exciting.\"<ref name=\"PearceWhatCulture\" />\n\nIn ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]'', Stark has become the [[Benefactor (law)|benefactor]] of the Avengers.<ref name=\"WiglerMTV\" /><ref name=\"FeigeIGN2014\" /><ref name=\"DigitalSpy2015\" /> On how his character evolves after the events of ''Iron Man 3'', Downey said, \"I think he realizes that tweaking and making all the suits in the world\u2014which is what he has been doing\u2014still didn't work for that thing of his tour of duty that left him a little [[PTSD]]. So his focus is more on how can we make it so that there's no problem to begin with. That, you know, there's a bouncer at our planet's rope. That's the big idea.\"<ref name=\"DowneySR2014\" /> The events of ''Age of Ultron'' lead directly into the conflict of ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'', in which Stark leads a faction of Avengers in support of the regulation of individuals with superpowers.<ref name=\"VarietyAug2015\" /><ref name=\"FandangoMarch2016\" />  Anthony Russo said that Stark's egomania allowed the writers \"to bring him to a point in his life where he was willing to submit to an authority, where he felt it was the right thing to do.\" Joe Russo added that because of the visions Stark saw in ''Age of Ultron'', he now has a guilt complex which \"drives him to make very specific decisions\", calling his emotional arc \"very complicated\".<ref name=\"RussosEmpire2015\" /> Downey's personal trainer Eric Oram stated that the trick to pitting Rogers against Stark, \"is to show Iron Man using the 'minimum force' necessary to win the fight\".<ref name=\"DowneyTrainer\" /> Marvel initially wanted Downey's part to be smaller, but \"Downey wanted Stark to have a more substantial role in the film's plot.\" ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' noted that Downey would receive $40 million-plus backend for his participation, as well as an additional payout if the film outperformed ''Captain America: The Winter Soldier'', as Marvel would attribute that success to Downey's presence.<ref name=\"DowneyVariety2014\" />\n\nIn ''[[Spider-Man: Homecoming]]'', Stark is Peter Parker's mentor and is the creator of the U.S. Department of Damage Control.<ref name=\"KitTHR2016\" /><ref name=\"FilmSetVisitPg2\" /> [[Sony Pictures Motion Picture Group]] chairman [[Thomas Rothman]] noted that, beyond the commercial advantage of featuring Downey in the film, the inclusion of Stark was important due to the relationship established between him and Parker in ''Captain America: Civil War''.<ref name=\"RothmanDowney2016\" /> Watts noted that after Stark's actions in ''Civil War'', introducing Parker to life as an Avenger, there are \"a lot of repercussions to that. Is it a first step towards Tony as some sort of mentor figure? Is he comfortable with that?\"<ref name=\"DamageControl\" /> Co-writer [[Jonathan Goldstein (screenwriter)|Jonathan Goldstein]] compared Stark to [[Ethan Hawke]]'s father character in ''[[Boyhood (2014 film)|Boyhood]]'' (2014).<ref name=\"GoldsteinDaleyCS\" />\n\nDowney reprised the role in ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'' (2018) and ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'' (2019).<ref name=\"DowneyAvengers2&3\" /><ref name=\"KitTHR2016\" /> ''Iron Man 3'' director [[Shane Black]] stated in March 2013 that \"There has been a lot of discussion about it: 'Is this the last ''Iron Man'' for Robert [Downey Jr.]?' Something tells me that it will not be the case, and [he] will be seen in a fourth, or fifth.\" Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige said that the character of Stark would continue to be featured in the Marvel Cinematic Universe regardless of Downey's involvement.<ref name=\"BlackSR2013\" /> Also in March, Downey said he was open to extending his contract, stating he feels \"there's a couple other things we've gotta do\" with the character.<ref name=\"DowneySR2013\" /> In June 2013, when Downey signed on to return as Iron Man in ''Avengers: Age of Ultron'', he also signed on for a third ''Avengers'' film.<ref name=\"DowneyAvengers2&3\" /> In a July 2014 interview during the filming of ''Avengers: Age of Ultron'', Downey expressed his interest in continuing to play Iron Man. \"It's down to Kevin [Feige] and [[Isaac Perlmutter|Ike]] [Perlmutter, CEO of Marvel Entertainment] and Disney to come to us with what the proposal is, and that\u2019s on us to agree or disagree,\" Downey said. \"When things are going great, there's a lot of agreement.\" He added, \"It's that thing of: Why give up the belt when it feels like you can barely get jabbed?\"<ref name=\"DowneyJuly2014\" /> In April 2016, Downey expressed openness to appearing in a potential fourth ''Iron Man'' film, saying \"I could do one more.\"<ref name=\"DowneyCBR2016\" /> Downey's Marvel contract expired following ''Avengers: Endgame'', where Stark dies.<ref name=\"DowneyContract2019\" />\n\nStark's fashion sense evolved over the course of the films, initially being described as \"woefully basic...  mostly saggy jeans, henleys and tank tops\u2014with an occasional suit\", but improving by the time of the first ''Avengers'' film,<ref name=\"DworkenVulture\" /> and becoming more sophisticated by ''Civil War'', as Stark matured and accepted greater responsibility for the consequences of his actions.<ref name=\"MakovskyCW\" /> Downey expressed the desire for his wardrobe to reflect that \"you still know he's Tony Stark, and you still know that he's the richest man in the world\".<ref name=\"MakovskyCW\" /> Stark's clothing has been described as alternating between \"a sweet suit with some shades\" in his corporate look, \"or a t-shirt, jeans, and an arc reactor\" in his personal time.<ref name=\"CosplaysEndgame\" /> His fashion sense has been referred to as \"part Mob boss and part ''[[The Big Bang Theory|Big Bang Theory]]'' cast member\", and alternating \"between boxy pinstripe suits and faux-ironic vintage tees\".<ref name=\"DworkenVulture\" />\n\n===Armor and special effects===\n{{main|Iron Man's armor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)}}\n[[File:Iron Man Mark III armor from Iron Man (2008 film).jpg|thumb|right|upright|Tony Stark's armor, as seen in ''Iron Man'' (2008)]]\n\nTony Stark has worn multiple different armors in his MCU appearances. For ''Iron Man'', [[Stan Winston]] and his company built metal and rubber versions of the armors featured in the film,<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\" /> while Iron Man comic book artist [[Adi Granov]] designed the Mark III with illustrator Phil Saunders.<ref name=\"GranovSaunders\" /> [[Industrial Light & Magic]] (ILM) created the digital armors in the film,<ref name=\"FavreauEffectsConcerns\" /> with [[The Orphanage (company)|The Orphanage]] and [[The Embassy Visual Effects|The Embassy]] doing additional work. To help with animating the more refined suits, information was sometimes captured by having Downey wear only the helmet, sleeves and chest of the costume over a [[motion capture]] suit.<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\" />\n\nFor ''Iron Man 2'', ILM again did the majority of the effects, as it did on the first film, with [[Double Negative (VFX)|Double Negative]] also working on the film.<ref name=\"ILMBenSnow\" /> In the filming of ''The Avengers'', [[Weta Digital]] took over duties for animating Iron Man during the forest duel from ILM.<ref name=\"AWN\" /> For ''Iron Man 3'', [[Digital Domain]], [[Scanline VFX]] and Trixter each worked on separate shots featuring the Mark 42 armor, working with different digital models. The studios shared some of their files to ensure consistency between the shots. For the Mark 42 and Iron Patriot armors, [[Legacy Effects]] constructed partial suits that were worn on set.<ref name=\"Fxguide2\" />\n\n==Differences from the comics==\nThe origin story of Iron Man has been updated for the films. In the comics, Stark becomes Iron Man following an experience in the [[Vietnam War]], which is changed to the [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|War in Afghanistan]].<ref name=\"EraoSR\" /> [[Edwin Jarvis|Jarvis]], in the comics, is the family butler, while in the films [[J.A.R.V.I.S.]] is an artificial intelligence created by Stark,<ref name=\"HowardCB\" /> though still inspired by the butler from Stark's childhood, [[Edwin Jarvis (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Edwin Jarvis]], who is revealed to have died by the time the first film takes place.<ref name=\"EraoSR\" /> Stark also proceeds through the early iterations of his armor to reach the now-familiar red and gold color scheme much more quickly. Stark's personality more closely resembles the Ultimate Comics version.<ref name=\"EraoSR\" />\n\nThe AI version of J.A.R.V.I.S. is eventually uploaded by Stark to an artificial body and becomes [[Vision (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Vision]]. In the films, Vision is created by Stark and Banner as a counter to Ultron. In the comics, however, Ultron is created by a different member of the Avengers, [[Hank Pym]], and aspects of Pym's personality are integrated into this version of Ultron, such as a desire for peace.<ref name=\"BrowneSR\" /> Another difference in the films is the romance between Stark and Pepper Potts. In the comics, Potts has unrequited feelings for Stark, and ultimately becomes involved with Stark's chauffeur and bodyguard, Happy Hogan.<ref name=\"HowardCB\" /><ref name=\"BrowneSR\" />\n \nA new approach not seen in comics is Stark's mentorial relationship with [[Peter Parker (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Peter Parker]]. In the [[Ultimate Comics]], Stark and Parker do not go past the normal trainer-trainee relationship. In the MCU, Stark is also the creator of two iterations of Parker's Spider-Man suits, unlike in the comics where he only creates the [[Iron Spider|Iron Spider Armor]], while Parker creates other suits by himself.<ref name=\"McMillanWired\" /> Stark is also shown to have a history with Parker's foes [[Adrian Toomes (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Vulture]] and [[Mysterio (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Mysterio]]; both are depicted as having turned into villains due to [[perverse incentive|unforeseen consequences]] of actions by Stark. While he does not end up facing them, his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 does.<ref name=\"VultureSR\" /><ref name=\"MysterioPS\" />\n\nThe Mandarin, a recurring Iron Man villain in the comics, turns out to be just an actor portraying the character, with the real criminal mastermind behind the acts claimed by \"the Mandarin\" being [[Aldrich Killian (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Aldrich Killian]]\u2014a minor character in the comics.<ref name=\"BrowneSR\" /><ref name=\"MandarinMTV\" /> [[Mandarin (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|The Mandarin]] is revealed to be a real person in the Marvel One-Shot ''[[All Hail the King]]'';<ref name=\"MandarinSR\" /> this version is instead portrayed as the father and enemy of [[Shang-Chi (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Shang-Chi]] in ''[[Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings]]'' (2021).<ref name=\"MandarinShangChi\" />\n\n==Reception==\nDowney's portrayal of the character has been widely praised by fans and critics. [[Roger Ebert]] praised Downey's performance in ''Iron Man'', stating \"At the end of the day it's Robert Downey Jr. who powers the lift-off separating this from most other superhero movies\".<ref name=\"Ebert\" /> [[Frank Lovece]] of ''[[Film Journal International]]'', a one-time Marvel Comics writer, commended that ''Iron Man 2'' \"doesn't find a changed man. Inside the metal, imperfect humanity grows even more so, as thought-provoking questions of identity meet techno-fantasy made flesh\".<ref name=\"FrankLoveceReview\" />\n\nFor ''The Avengers'', Joe Morgenstern of ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''\u2014despite complimenting Downey's performance\u2014favored his work in ''Iron Man'' over his acting in ''The Avengers'': \"His Iron Man is certainly a team player, but Mr. Downey comes to the party with two insuperable superpowers: a character of established sophistication\u2014the industrialist/inventor Tony Stark, a sharp-tongued man of the world\u2014and his own quicksilver presence that finds its finest expression in self-irony\".<ref name=\"MorgensternAvengers\" /> In his review of ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'', Morgenstern lauded both actor and character, praising \"Robert Downey Jr.'s startlingly smart Tony Stark\" who, along with Chris Evans' Captain America and Chris Hemsworth's Thor, contributed to that film's \"feeling of family ... because the debuts of its most prominent members remain vivid to this day.\"<ref name=\"MorgensternEndgame\" />\n\nIn 2015, ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]'' named Tony Stark the 13th greatest film character of all time.<ref name=\"EmpireGreatest\" /> In 2019, following Stark's death in ''Avengers: Endgame'', a statue representing the character in his Iron Man armor was erected in [[Forte dei Marmi]], Italy.<ref name=\"ItalyStatue\" />\n\n===Accolades===\n{{Anchor|Awards|Accolades}}\nDowney has received numerous nominations and awards for his portrayal of Tony Stark. He notably won the [[Saturn Award for Best Actor]] three times,<ref name=\"2009SaturnAwards\" /><ref name=\"2014SaturnAwards\" /><ref name=\"2019SaturnAwards\" /> making him a record four-time winner (he had previously won the award for 1993's ''[[Heart and Souls]]'');<ref name=\"1994SaturnAwards\" /> it is also the record for most wins for portraying the same character, tied with [[Mark Hamill]] for playing [[Luke Skywalker]].<ref name=\"HamillSaturn\" /><ref name=\"HamillSaturn2\" /><ref name=\"HamillSaturn3\" />\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
