Ka-Zar also appeared in ''[[Human Torch]]'' #5 (Fall 1941). Ka-Zar was featured in new stories until ''Marvel Mystery Comics'' #27 (January 1942).\n\nIn 2006, the David Rand Ka-Zar was featured in the ''All-New Official Handbook to the Marvel Universe A-Z''.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nBorn in South Africa in 1918, three-year-old David Rand accompanied his British parents John and Constance on a flight to Cairo to visit his grandfather. Unfortunately, their plane crashed in the [[Congolian forests|Congo jungle]]. Constance died in the crash and John was driven mad. Living in the jungle with his father, isolated from the local tribes, David grew under the jungle's hardships into an unusually powerful youth and developed strong empathy with wildlife, notably rescuing Zar the [[Lion]] from quicksand. When a criminal named Paul de Kraft discovered emeralds in Congo, John died opposing him only for Zar to scare Paul de Kraft off. With the support of Zar, David became the jungle's leading warrior within a few years challenging different animals like Bardak the [[Ape]] and N'Jaga the [[Leopard]]. Considered to be \"god-like\" by the natives, David Rand ended up named Ka-Zar (native for \"Brother of Zar\"). When Paul de Kraft returned to seize the emerald deposits, Ka-Zar killed him, thus avenging his father.\n\nWith the help of the local animals, Ka-Zar established himself as the guardian of the jungle which involved meting out harsh retribution to any intruder seeking to exploit his resources-but he frequently aided more benign explorers, such as when he protected Prof. Rice and his daughter Mara from the criminal pilot \"Red\" Skelton, rescued Rita Grey from the Wabi tribe, and helped two [[Scotland Yard]] detectives capture murderer London Jack. \n\nKa-Zar's friends are an elephant named Trajah and a lion named Zar.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Nevins |first1=Jess |title=Encyclopedia of Golden Age Superheroes |date=2013 |publisher=High Rock Press |isbn=978-1-61318-023-5 |page=145}}</ref> When Zar was captured by the vicious Rajah Sarput and a big game hunter named Bradley, Ka-Zar stowed away on a ship when Zar was shipped to the United States. Though he managed to free Zar, Ka-Zar ended up being arrested when he tried to free the zoo animals. Fortunately, Ruth Wilson (another woman whom Ka-Zar had rescued during an African expedition), vouched for him. Ka-Zar and Zar were granted passage back to Africa on a British ship. Surviving attacks by entrenched Nazi forces, Ka-Zar and Zar confronted Sarput who was ultimately slain by their ally Trajah. Soon after, Ka-Zar learned he had inherited his father's Transvaal diamond mines. After preventing his inheritance's theft by John Rand's law partner Alec Wright, Ka-Zar donated the wealth to war relief in England.\n\nIn 1941, as America's superheroes were gearing up for [[World War II]], Ka-Zar and his lion returned from America to his native Africa to spend some time fighting Italian and German troops.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Mitchell |first1=Kurt |last2=Thomas |first2=Roy |title=American Comic Book Chronicles: 1940-1944 |date=2019 |publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing |isbn=978-1605490892 |page=67}}</ref> While on an expedition to the mysterious Black River Region, Ka-Zar encountered giants and subterranean lizard people. Ka-Zar managed to befriend a giant named Bogat. Ka-Zar later waged a series of campaigns against the Axis forces in Ethiopia, Somaliland, and anywhere else in Africa where the Axis forces were camped, killing them with their own weapons with help from the French and British forces. Following one such encounter, Ka-Zar was restored to health by an aged witch doctor, who gave him a brew used centuries before to grant his tribe superhuman strength. \n\nLast time anyone heard from Ka-Zar, he protected his region's wildlife when Africa was threatened by monstrous tidal waves from Atlantean warfare. The rest of Ka-Zar's life after that was left unchronicled.\n\nIn the 1960s, Marvel Comics reintroduced a Ka-Zar character (named [[Kevin Plunder|Kevin Reginald, Lord Plunder]]) into their universe of superhero characters, who still appears in their comics today occasionally.\n\n==Reception==\nRobert Michael Bobb Cotter in the 2008 book ''The Great Monster Magazines'' points out that writer Bob Byrd \"did little to distinguish his hero from the other [pulp magazine] noble savages, including beginning his name with the letter 'K', which for some reason had become the accepted letter to start an imitation [[Tarzan|Tarzan's]] name\".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cotter |first1=Robert Michael Bobb |title=The Great Monster Magazines: A Critical Study of the Black and White Publications of the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s |date=2008 |publisher=McFarland & Co |isbn=978-0786433896 |page=162}}</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* [http://www.internationalhero.co.uk/k/kazargoldenage.htm Ka-Zar (David Rand)] at the International Catalogue of Superheroes\n* {{comicbookdb|type=character|id=3576|title=Ka-Zar (David Rand)}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks06/0603981.txt ''Ka-Zar: King of Claw and Fang'' by Bob Byrd] at [[Project Gutenberg Australia]]\n* [http://marvel.com/universe/Ka-Zar_(David_Rand) Ka-Zar (David Rand)] at the Marvel Universe\n* {{webarchive |url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20061101035428/http://home.comcast.net/~cjh5801a/Ka-Zar.htm |title=The Holloway Pages: Pulp Heroes: \"Ka-Zar\" (Golden Age version) |date=2006-11-01}}\n* {{isfdb series|41164}}\n{{Ka-Zar}}\n\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1936]]\n[[Category:Characters in fantasy literature]]\n[[Category:Fantasy comics]]\n[[Category:Jungle men]]\n[[Category:Jungle superheroes]]\n[[Category:Pulp magazines]]\n[[Category:Timely Comics characters]]\n[[Category:Magazines established in 1936]]\n[[Category:Magazines disestablished in 1937]]\n[[Category:Characters in pulp fiction]]"}]},"733315":{"pageid":733315,"ns":0,"title":"Ka-Zar (Kevin Plunder)","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"wikitext","*":"{{Short description|Fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics}}\n{{About|the Silver Age iteration of Ka-Zar|the Golden Age version|Ka-Zar (David Rand)}}\n{{Infobox comics character\n|character_name = Ka-Zar\n|image          = Ka-Zar (Kevin Plunder).png\n|converted      = y\n|caption        = Ka-Zar with his ''[[Smilodon]]'' [[Zabu]], art by Mike Mayhew.\n|real_name      = Kevin Plunder\n|species        = Human\n|publisher      = [[Marvel Comics]]\n|debut          = ''[[Uncanny X-Men|The X-Men]]'' #10 (March 1965)\n|creators       = [[Stan Lee]]<br>[[Jack Kirby]]\n|alliances      = Agents of Wakanda\n|partners       = [[Zabu]]<br>[[Shanna the She-Devil]]\n|aliases        = Lord of the Hidden Jungle\n|powers         = Great hunter, trapper, fisherman, forager, and survivalist<br>Enhanced physical attributes<br>Carries various weapons<br>Clairvoyance<br>Ability to communicate with some animals\n|cat            = superhero\n|addcharcat1    = Marvel Comics characters\n|hero           = y\n|subcat         = Ka-Zar\n}}\n'''Kevin Plunder''' is a fictional [[superhero]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]].

Created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]] in ''[[Uncanny X-Men|The X-Men]]'' #10 (March 1965), he lives in the [[dinosaur]]-populated [[Savage Land]], which was hidden beneath [[Antarctica]] by [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrials]].

Kevin Plunder refers to himself as the \"Lord of the Savage Land\", a phrase others have adopted, but this is not a formal title.\n\nKa-Zar's first solo story was published in ''Marvel Super-Heroes'' #19 (1969), and the character had features in the black-and-white magazine ''[[Savage Tales]]'' and the color title ''[[Astonishing Tales]]''. He has had five self-titled series, the first published in 1970\u20131971 (three issues, mostly reprints), the second, which continued the storyline from ''Astonishing Tales'', in 1974-1977 (20 issues, subtitled ''Lord of the Hidden Jungle'') by [[Mike Friedrich]], [[Gerry Conway]], and [[Doug Moench]], the third in 1981-1984, ''Ka-Zar the Savage'', (34 issues) by [[Bruce Jones (comics)|Bruce Jones]] and [[Mike Carlin]], the fourth in 1997-1998 (20 issues) written by [[Mark Waid]]<ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=20710 Ka-Zar, 1997], Pipeline, [[Comic Book Resources]], April 7, 2009</ref> and drawn by [[Andy Kubert]], and the fifth in 2011 (5-issue miniseries) written by [[Paul Jenkins (writer)|Paul Jenkins]].\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nKa-Zar is Kevin Reginald, Lord Plunder, born in Castle Plunder, [[Kentish Town]], [[London]], [[England]]. He is the eldest son of Lord Robert Plunder, the [[England|English]] [[nobility|nobleman]] who discovered the [[Savage Land]]. After his mother had died and his father was killed by the barbaric Man-Ape natives of the Savage Land, Plunder was found and raised by the [[smilodon|sabertooth tiger]] [[Zabu]], who possesses near-human intelligence thanks to a [[mutation]] caused by radioactive mists.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Brevoort |first1=Tom |last2=DeFalco |first2=Tom |last3=Manning |first3=Matthew K. |last4=Sanderson |first4=Peter |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |title=Marvel Year By Year: A Visual History |date=2017 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1465455505 |page=107}}</ref> \"Ka-Zar\" means \"Son of the Tiger\" in the language of the Man-Apes. Ka-Zar and Zabu are constant partners. Ka-Zar became an expert hunter, trapper, and fisherman, living off the wild land. In the Savage Land, some territories are populated by several human or humanoid tribes, and while most of them are on friendly terms with Ka-Zar, some of them consider him an outlander and an enemy. He acts more like an unofficial general protector, preventing outside commercial exploitation, such as poaching and [[mining]], as well as enforcing peace between tribes and serving as goodwill ambassador to friendly visitors.\n\nThe original [[X-Men]] discovered the Savage Land, and Ka-Zar encountered them, battling Maa-Gor for the first time.<ref>''The X-Men'' #10</ref> He then encountered [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]] for the first time, and battled his brother Parnival, who had become the [[supervillain]] called the [[Plunderer (character)|Plunderer]].<ref>''Daredevil'' #12-14</ref> He first battled [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]]'s [[Savage Land Mutates]] alongside the X-Men.<ref>''The X-Men'' #61-63.

Jonah Jameson]] convinced him that Spider-Man was a menace when the wall-crawler's memory was erased and he was tricked into working with [[Doctor Octopus]]. Spider-Man's memory was restored during the fight, with Ka-Zar subsequently apologizing for the mistake and proclaiming Spider-Man as the most valiant opponent he had ever fought.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #57.

Marvel Comics.</ref> Ka-Zar has teamed up with several of Marvel's heroes. The X-Men are recurrent visitors to the Savage Land and Ka-Zar has been a frequent ally, helping the mutant team defeat both inside and outside menaces such as [[Sauron (comics)|Sauron]] and Magneto. He has met Spider-Man on several occasions, one of which involved stopping [[Stegron|Stegron the Dinosaur Man]] from invading New York City with Savage Land dinosaurs. Ka-Zar has also assisted the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] in their attempt to repel the space conqueror [[Terminus (comics)|Terminus]], but while they rescued many natives, they were unable to prevent the destruction of the Savage Land. Ka-Zar was rescued by the Avengers, but left the Savage Land for the civilized world.<ref>''The Avengers'' #256-258. Marvel Comics.</ref> Together, he and Shanna had a son named Matthew.

Soon afterward as part of the ''[[Secret Invasion]]'' storyline, a Skrull ship crashes in the Savage Land releasing earlier versions of modern superheroes (who claim to be the originals replaced by Skrulls for some time), and who have escaped. Shanna and Ka-Zar soon learn, however, that these are simply more Skrulls in disguise. Spider-Man soon encounters Ka-Zar, Shanna, Zabu, and some of the natives accusing them of being Skrulls. Just then, the Captain America from the ship attacked thinking the same for Spider-Man. Ka-Zar, Shanna, and Zabu help Spider-Man fight the Captain America from the ship until he is hit by a dart that causes him to regress to a Skrull named Pitt'o Nili, who is killed by Shanna while still believing himself to be Captain America due to the extensive mind conditioning carried out on him.<ref>''The New Avengers'' #42. Marvel Comics.</ref> He then later goes with the rest of the Avengers to New York City to help them fight off the Skrull invasion while Shanna stays behind with Zabu to fight off anymore Skrulls left in the Savage Land.<ref>''Secret Invasion'' #7.

After reuniting Moon-Boy with Devil Dinosaur, Ka-Zar tells Reptil that he will help him find his parents.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative Featuring Reptil''.

Ka-Zar and Gorilla Man are then seen inside Roxxon's secret base in [[Antarctica]], fighting the company's Berserkers alongside [[Blade (comics)|Blade]].<ref>''Avengers'' (vol. 8) #19-20. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nDuring the \"[[Empyre]]\" storyline, Ka-Zar is unable to reach Shanna the She-Devil. Black Panther instructs Brother Voodoo to take Ka-Zar, Zabu, Black Knight, and Scarlet Witch with him to investigate. They arrive to find a slain Tyrannosaurus as Scarlet Witch senses they are surrounded. The group is attacked by the Cotati and they fight them until the Cotati Ventri unleash Man-Thing who they have under their control. As Ventri states that the Savage Land and the world will be theirs, Ka-Zar is shocked to find that the Cotati have gained control of Shanna.<ref>''Empyre: Avengers'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> Due to her connection with the Savage Land's lifeforce which the Cotati took advantage of, Shanna tries to get Ka-Zar to join them as Matthew states to Black Knight that they have to do something. Doctor Voodoo used a trick to do a mental trick. Scarlet Witch does the same as she tries to free Shanna from the Cotati's control. To assist her, Scarlet Witch brings Ka-Zar into Shanna's mind where he learns that some creatures in the Savage Land are dying and trees are falling. As Matthew and Black Knight fight the Cotati, a Doctor Voodoo-controlled Man-Thing fights the Cotati's control and defeats Ventri. When Ka-Zar frees Shanna from the Cotati's control, he is stabbed in the back by a Cotati using Black Knight's Ebony Blade.<ref>''Empyre: Avengers'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> Now back to her senses, the She-Devil aids the Avengers against the invaders. Meanwhile, Scarlet Witch and Doctor Voodoo work to extract Ka-Zar's soul from the Ebony Blade, to which Shanna then uses the same fluids of the Man-Thing which revived her in order to heal and resurrect Ka-Zar. It works as the Savage Lord helps turn the tide on the Cotati where dinosaurs show up to help.<ref>''Empyre: Avengers'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nKa-Zar would have trouble adjusting to his newly expanded senses while life in the Savage Land would come under threat by a precursor to its creation known as Domovoy the Flesh Weaver. He would work through this odd connection with the world Kevin calls home now shared between him & his wife in the time needed to save their son from the Polyscion's plans of global terraforming.<ref>''Ka-Zar: Lord of the Savage Land'' #1-4. Marvel Comics.</ref> In the meantime, between domestic concerns and globe trotting adventures, Ka-Zar would continue his work as an Agent of Wakanda. Working as a temporal explorer sent back to the distant past of the newly formed Earth on an observation mission regarding it's primordial defenders wellbeing on T'Challa's behalf. After an encounter with the ancient ancestors of Earth's Mightiest, during a battle with Kid Thanos of Titan; a rival time traveler, Ka-Zar's attempted return to his own time is waylaid by the [[Howard Stark#Iron Inquisitor|Iron Inquisitor]] on orders from Mephistopheles.<ref>''Avengers'' (vol. 8) #50. Marvel Comics.</ref> Finding himself stranded in an alien timeline on a world soon to be consumed by its still living iteration of Galactus, Ka-Zar poises himself for the fight of his life. He soon becomes The Devourer's new herald in exchange for maneuvering this new handler into getting back to his home reality to warn the Avengers of the threat posed to their universe. Now backed by Power Cosmic, the Savage Herald seeks out viable and uninhabited planets for Galactus to feed upon whilst navigating time and space to make his way home.<ref>''Avengers'' (vol. 8) #50. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nKevin Plunder is an athletic man with no superhuman powers. He utilizes a unique style of hand-to-hand combat shaped by years of surviving in the Savage Land. He has developed great skills in hunting, trapping, fishing, foraging, and general survival in the wild. He carries a {{convert|12|in|mm|adj=on}} [[Bowie knife]], and occasionally uses a [[Sling (weapon)|sling]], [[bow and arrow]], and other primitive weapons. He can also communicate with some animals. It was revealed in ''Astonishing Tales'' #11, scripted by Roy Thomas, that Ka-Zar's and Zabu's physical abilities had been enhanced by passing through some mysterious mist.<ref>''Astonishing Tales'' #11</ref> The mists later endowed other characters (Maa-Gor and El Tigre) with superhuman abilities.<ref>''Ka-Zar'' (vol. 2) #3-5.
