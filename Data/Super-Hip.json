He first appeared in ''The [[Adventures of Bob Hope]]'' #95 (October-November 1965), in a story written by [[Arnold Drake]] and drawn by [[Bob Oksner]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wells |first1=John |title=American Comic Book Chronicles: 1965-1969 |date=2014 |publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing |isbn=978-1605490557 |page=38}}</ref>\n\n==Publication history==\nSuper-Hip appeared regularly in ''The Adventures of Bob Hope'' from issue #95 until issue #107, where he only appears in the last two panels. He does not appear in what would be the last two issues, #108 and #109, of the series.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Markstein |first1=Don |website=Don Markstein's Toonopedia |accessdate=2 April 2020  |url=http://www.toonopedia.com/superhip.htm |title=Super-Hip}}</ref>\n\nSuper-Hip's sole non-''Bob Hope'' appearance in the Silver Age was in ''[[Doom Patrol]]'' vol. 1, #104 (June 1966), as one of several super-hero guests (although the only \"humor title\" guest) at the wedding of [[Elasti-Girl]] and [[Mento (comics)|Mento]]. The story was scripted by [[Arnold Drake]].\n\nIn the modern era, Super-Hip makes a brief appearance in [[Batman: The Brave and the Bold (comics)|''Batman: The Brave and the Bold'']] #15 (March 2010), fighting the [[Mad Mod]] alongside [[Batman]] and [[Brother Power, The Geek]].\n\nHe appeared in ''[[Doom Patrol]]'' #20 (March 2011). According to the events of the issue (wherein he grants succor to a recently deported Doom Patrol), he is an old friend of Cliff Steele, a.k.a. [[Robotman (Cliff Steele)|Robotman]].\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n'''Tadwallader Jutefruce''' (a [[spoonerism|spooneristic]] [[pun]] on \"fruit juice\") is the [[crew cut]] and [[bow tie]]-clad 'nephew' of [[Bob Hope]] and a student at [[Benedict Arnold]] [[High school (North America)|High School]],{{dead link|date=March 2018}}<ref>{{cite web |url=http://popcultureaddict.com/comic-books/lamestsuperheroesii-htm/ |title=The Top Ten Lamest Superheroes of All Time II: The Next Ten |author=Sam Tweedle |work=Confessions of a Pop Culture Addict |accessdate=January 3, 2014}}</ref> an educational facility whose \"Faculty of Fear\" is made up entirely of [[Universal Horror]]-style monsters, including [[principal (school)|principal]] Dr. Van Pyre, [[German language|German]]-accented science teacher Prof. Heinrich von Wolfmann, and [[coach (sport)|coach]] Franklin Stein.  \n\nWhenever Tad loses his temper (usually at the instigation of a stupid [[prank]] by fellow students [[billionaire]] [[motorcycling|biker]] bully Badger Goldliver and his simple-minded [[Stooge (comedian)|stooge]] Doltish), the uptight mild-mannered boy genius turns green, starts to spin like a [[tornado]] and transforms into Super-Hip.  \n\nThe long-haired Super-Hip's outfit resembles a 1960s [[Carnaby Street]] [[Mod (subculture)|Mod]] a la [[Austin Powers (character)|Austin Powers]], complete with ruffled shirt, velvet jacket, and [[Chelsea Boot|Chelsea boots]] with winged ankles that, similar to the [[Sub-Mariner]], allow him to fly. He also magically acquires an [[electric guitar]] which causes whoever hears it to dance uncontrollably whenever he plays [[rock and roll]], and he can change his form into virtually anything, limited only by his often [[surrealism|surreal]] imagination.  \n\nTad has no memory of his time as the obnoxious and egotistical \"Sultan of Swingers\", and the only ones who know of his secret identity are his Uncle Bob and his highly educated talking [[dog]], [[Harvard|Harvard-Harvard]].  \n\nSuper-Hip's [[battle cry|battle-cry]] is \"Down with/Blech to [[Lawrence Welk]]!\", as hearing the [[television]] [[bandleader]]'s [[schmaltz]]y music acts like [[kryptonite]] on him.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n==External links==\n*[http://www.toonopedia.com/superhip.htm Super-Hip] at [[Don Markstein's Toonopedia]].
