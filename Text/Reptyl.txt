He later became the leader of a band of space pirates. He sheltered a [[Skrull]] posing as the [[Contemplator (Marvel Comics)|Contemplator]] from [[Galactus]]'s vengeance. Reptyl captured the [[Silver Surfer]] and Galactus's herald [[Nova (Frankie Raye)|Nova]]. He battled the escaped Nova, and was forced to release the Silver Surfer.

Shortly thereafter he came into conflict with Mantis and the Avengers. Before that adventure concluded, Reptyl lost his newfound abilities and reverted to his normal power level.<ref>''[[Avengers: Celestial Quest]]'' #2-8 (December 2001-June 2002)</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nReptyl possessed superhuman strength, speed, stamina, durability, agility, and reflexes as a result of his reptilian alien heritage, as well as a vulnerability to extreme cold. He resembled a humanoid dinosaur (Saurornithoides) with green scaly ridged hide, sharpened teeth and claws, and a {{convert|3|ft|m|adj=on}} tail. He was an experienced armed and unarmed combatant, a highly skilled leader and space pilot, and a master of most known hand weapons. He wore body armor and a space suit of alien materials, and carried a ray-pistol and sword.\n\nReptyl later became Reptyl Prime as a result of genetic mutation. His superhuman strength and stamina increased, he gained the ability to fly at warp speed, and was no longer vulnerable to cold. He resembles a {{convert|15+1/2|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} mythological dragon with grey scaly ridged hide, sharpened teeth and {{convert|6|in|mm|adj=on}} claws, bat-like wings [{{convert|35|ft|m|adj=on}} wingspan], and a {{convert|7|ft|m|adj=on}} spiked tail. Reptyl Prime also gained the ability to manipulate cosmic energy in the form of concussive blasts of cosmic force, and the ability to exist in space unprotected.\n\n==In other media==\n===Video games===\n* Reptyl is featured as a boss in the [[NES]] ''[[Silver Surfer (video game)|Silver Surfer]]'' game.{{cn|date=June 2022}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*http://www.marvel.com/universe/Reptyl\n*{{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix3/reptylsaurian.htm|Reptyl}}\n\n{{Silver Surfer}}\n[[Category:Characters created by Steve Englehart]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1988]]\n[[Category:Fictional reptiles]]\n[[Category:Fictional space pilots]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics aliens]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters who can move at superhuman speeds]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters with accelerated healing]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters with superhuman strength]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics extraterrestrial supervillains]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]\n[[Category:Space pirates]]"}]}}}}
