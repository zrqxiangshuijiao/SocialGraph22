He returns with the other Invaders in the miniseries ''Invaders Now!'', beginning with issue #1 (Nov. 2010).

Leaving the prisoner on the planet Jupiter, Aarkus accepts Erickson's invitation to fight crime on Earth.<ref>''[[Marvel Mystery Comics]]'' #13 (Nov. 1940)</ref> Aarkus does so for several years, although during World War II he is briefly manipulated by the [[Axis powers of World War II|Axis]] powers into fighting the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]]. The superhero team the [[Invaders (comics)|Invaders]] help Aarkus realize his mistake.<ref>''[[Invaders (comics)|The Invaders]]'' vol. 2, #3 (July 1993)</ref>\n\nA [[simulacrum]] of the Vision was temporarily created by [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]], along with those of the [[Blazing Skull]], the [[Fin (comics)|Fin]], and the Golden Age [[Angel (Thomas Halloway)|Angel]] and [[Jeffrey Mace|Patriot]], to aid the superhero team the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] during the [[Kree-Skrull War]].<ref>''[[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]]'' #97 (March 1972)</ref>\n\nA later story presents the character as inhabiting the sewers under New York, taking care of a Cosmic Cube that is feeding off the feelings of people affected by the death of [[Captain America]].

The story presents events from World War II, portraying Aarkus as erasing the memories of the Invaders (with their consent) in order to hide the location of an ancient Kree weapon called the God's Whisper, that had granted [[Baron von Strucker]] the power to control gods. The Invaders then attack Kree in order to free Namor and recover the weapon.<ref>''All-New Invaders'' #2\u20133 (February\u2013March 2014)</ref> A later story presents Aarkus as working with the Eternals on using the God's Whisper to manipulate [[Galactus]].<ref>''All-New Invaders'' #13</ref>\n\n== Powers and abilities==\nThe Vision can generate illusory images of himself, fly, generate ice and extreme cold, and teleport wherever there is smoke.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\n==''Vision'' reprints==\nSome of the original stories of the original Vision have been reprinted in other publications.\n\n* ''Golden Age Marvel Comics Vol. 4'', Roy Thomas editor, (2009, hardcover, {{ISBN|978-0785124740}}) reprints Marvel Mystery Comics'\u00a0#13-16, 1940-41\n* ''Golden Age Marvel Comics Vol. 5'', Roy Thomas editor, (2010, hardcover, {{ISBN|978-0785133674}}) reprints Marvel Mystery Comics'\u00a0#17-20, 1941\n* ''Golden Age Marvel Comics Vol. 6'', Roy Thomas editor, (2011, hardcover, {{ISBN|978-0785142041}}) reprints Marvel Mystery Comics'\u00a0#21-24, 1941\n* ''Golden Age Marvel Comics Vol. 7'', Roy Thomas editor, (2012, hardcover, {{ISBN|978-0785150268}}) reprints Marvel Mystery Comics'\u00a0#25-28, 1941-42\t\t\t\t\n*''Marvel Visionaries: Jack Kirby Vol. 1'' (2004, hardcover, {{ISBN|0-7851-1574-9}}) reprints \"The Vision\" from Marvel Mystery Comics 13, Nov 1940 \n*''Marvel Visionaries: Jack Kirby Vol. 2'' (2006, hardcover, {{ISBN|0-7851-2094-7}}) reprints \"The Vision\" from Marvel Mystery Comics 23, Sept 1941\n* The comic ''[[Marvel Super-Heroes (comics)|Marvel Super-Heroes]]'', March 1968, reprints the Vision story from Marvel Mystery Comics 25\n\n==In other media==\nVision (Aarkus) was made a playable character in ''[[Marvel Contest of Champions]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2019-09-10|title=Champion Spotlight - Vision (Aarkus)|url=https://playcontestofchampions.com/champion-spotlight-vision-aarkus/|access-date=2021-04-30|website=Marvel Contest of Champions}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20101017134520/http://www.reocities.com/jjnevins/vision.html Vision] at [[Jess Nevins|Nevins, Jess]].
