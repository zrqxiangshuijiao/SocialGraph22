A [[common chimpanzee]] who wears a [[deerstalker]] hat ([[wikt:\u00e0 la|\u00e0 la]] [[Knight|Sir]] [[Arthur Conan Doyle]]'s fictional [[Detective|sleuth]] [[Sherlock Holmes]]), Detective Chimp has superhuman-level [[intelligence]] and solves crimes, often with the help of the Bureau of Amplified Animals, a group of intelligent animals that also includes [[Rex the Wonder Dog]]. He was originally created in the final years of the [[Golden Age of Comic Books]], during the [[interregnum]] between the former and the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]].<ref name=\"dc-ency\">{{Citation | last = Jimenez | first = Phil | author-link = Phil Jimenez | contribution = Detective Chimp | editor-last = Dougall | editor-first = Alastair | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia | pages = 100 | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]] | place = New York  | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-0-7566-4119-1 | oclc = 213309017}}</ref>\n\nAfter his initial appearance in ''Adventures of Rex the Wonder Dog'' he continued to appear in that title as a backup feature until 1959,<ref>{{cite book |last1=Rovin |first1=Jeff |title=The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Cartoon Animals |date=1991 |publisher=Prentice Hall Press |isbn=0-13-275561-0 |access-date=31 March 2020 |url=https://archive.org/details/illustratedencyc00rovi/page/30/mode/2up/ |page=31}}</ref> at which point he faded into obscurity. Several decades after his last appearance, Detective Chimp appeared in several cameos, namely in a 1981 story, \"Whatever Happened to Rex the Wonder Dog?\" (''[[DC Comics Presents]]'' #35) and later in a brief cameo with [[Angel and the Ape|Sam Simeon]] in [[Gorilla City]] during 1985's ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]''. Following these appearances, Bobo started appearing in DC titles with some regularity, appearing in issues of ''[[Green Lantern]]'', ''[[The Flash (comic book)|The Flash]]'', and other titles. This eventually led to prominent roles in the 2005 ''[[Day of Vengeance]]'' miniseries and subsequently as a regular in its [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] series ''[[Shadowpact]]''. The character has gone on to guest-star in other DC Comics titles, and has been a key member of the second incarnation of the [[Justice League Dark]] since its 2018 reboot.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nWhen first introduced, Detective Chimp was a simple, although intelligent, trained chimpanzee, who acted as a \"helping [[mascot]]\" for the local sheriff, after helping him to solve the murder of his chimpanzee trainer, Fred Thorpe.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Markstein |first1=Don |website=Don Markstein's Toonopedia |access-date=2 April 2020 |title=Detective Chimp |url=http://www.toonopedia.com/chimp.htm}}</ref> He could not speak, but could understand humans and make himself understood. Bobo, a smoker, is a member of [[Mensa International|Mensa]], and had a long-standing partnership with four other detectives as the Croatoan Society. One of the other former members of the Society was the detective/superhero [[Elongated Man|Ralph Dibny]].\n\nThe Chimp's origin has been revamped and elaborated on several times since his initial Silver Age appearances. 1989's ''[[Secret Origins]]'' (vol. 2) #40 credited the experimentation of a microscopic alien race with Bobo's intelligence. This origin has since been [[retcon]]ned, notably in the ''[[Day of Vengeance]]'' six-part limited series. In the latter it was shown that Bobo was captured in [[Gorilla City]], Equatorial Africa in 1953 by Fred Thorpe, who sought to train him for his carnival act: \"Bobo the Detective Chimp\". For the act, Detective Chimp was trained to answer some detective-related questions using a combination of signals and rewards, giving the illusion that he could \"discover the deepest secrets of the public\". Bobo formed a strong bond with Thorpe because Thorpe took care of him, and gave him a simpler life than in the jungle. The success of the act lasted until a trip to Florida, at which time Rex the Wonder Dog, took him to the [[Fountain of Youth]], where he gained the ability to speak to all living creatures, even humans, in their own language, as well as eternal youth. Rex's and Bobo's journey to the Fountain of Youth was originally depicted in the aforementioned ''[[DC Comics Presents]]'' #35, July 1981.<ref>{{cite journal|last = Wells|first = John|title = Flashback: Whatever Happened to...?|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue = #64|pages = 51\u201361|publisher = [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|date = May 2013}}</ref> The intelligence Bobo gained put a damper on the success of the sideshow act, and in at least one instance, he decided that a woman had in fact murdered her sister, and shared his insights with the local police.\n\nAt some point after this, Bobo was employed by the Bureau of Amplified Animals. It is not known how he left, or even if the Bureau still exists.<ref>''Green Lantern'' vol. 3 #30</ref>\n\nAfter the death of Fred Thorpe, he began to work by himself. Initially he did quite well, as a chimp detective was seen as a novelty. During this successful period he was visited by another detective, John Jones (actually the [[Martian Manhunter]], during the ''JLApe'' crisis), who thought Bobo's agency seemed to be doing better than his own.<ref>''Martian Manhunter Annual'' #2</ref>\n\nHowever, as an ape, without civil rights and being unable to stand as a juridical person, he could not enforce unpaid bills. When the public began to forget him, he became an alcoholic, never leaving the other-dimensional [[Oblivion Bar]] (which changed management twice during his time there), until the establishment was acquired by [[Nightmaster|Jim Rook]].\n\n\"Bobo\" is not his real name, which he declines to share.<ref>''Day of Vengeance'' #4. DC Comics.</ref> It is revealed by the Phantom Stranger to be \"mostly an unpronounceable screech and three grunts\", which translates as \"Magnificent Finder of Tasty Grubs\".<ref>''Shadowpact'' #7. DC Comics.</ref>\n\n===Shadowpact===\n[[Image:Dchimpx.png|Detective Chimp in modern times. A panel from ''Day of Vengeance'' #1 (June 2006), art by Justiniano.|thumb]]\nWhen the [[Spectre (DC Comics character)|Spectre]] attempts to destroy all magic and began killing wizards, Detective Chimp, while still mostly drunk, coerces a group of mystical characters gathered from the Oblivion Bar into battling the Spectre. This leads to the formation of the group the [[Shadowpact]].<ref name=\"dc-ency\"/>\n\nAlthough lacking superhuman powers, Detective Chimp exhibits not only fine detective skills but also the genius of a true tactician. Benefiting from the counsel of the [[Phantom Stranger]] (at the time transformed into a mouse), he devises a plan to use the powers of [[Black Alice (comics)|Black Alice]] and [[Nightshade (DC Comics)|Nightshade]] to confront the combined menace of [[Eclipso]] and the Spectre.\n\nBobo also helps clean up the demonic damage left from the Rock of Eternity's explosion over [[Gotham City]]. He captures the sin of \"Sloth\", which had possessed his long-time friend [[Rex the Wonder Dog]]. After the Rock is reformed, the sins re-imprisoned, and all magical influence cleaned out of Gotham, the dying [[Doctor Fate]] gives Detective Chimp the powerful Helmet of Fate. After finding it does not fit him, Detective Chimp convinces Captain Marvel to throw it to Earth, to let fate choose its next bearer.<ref>''Day of Vengeance: Infinite Crisis Special'' #1. DC Comics.</ref>\n\nWhen the helmet of Doctor Fate returns to Earth, Detective Chimp for a brief time bonds with it, granting him additional powers that he uses to assist the Gotham City police in apprehending the villain [[Trickster (comics)|Trickster]]. After struggling against the temptation of the helmet, Bobo sends it on to another journey.<ref>''Helmet of Fate: Detective Chimp'' #1. DC Comics.</ref>\n\nRecently, it has been shown that Bobo occasionally assists [[Batman]] in his cases by way of a [[chat room]] where they swap theories. The [[Riddler]] is also known to chat with them, but he is unaware of the other two's identities.<ref>''Detective Comics'' #845</ref>\n\n===''The New 52''===\nIn DC's [[The New 52|2011 reboot of its continuity]], Detective Chimp has been mentioned by [[Ambush Bug]] in the Channel 52 feature sections. He later appears as a brief cameo in aiding the [[Justice League United]] team rescue Adam Strange from the Zeta Beam<ref>''Justice League United'' #16, DC Comics</ref> and in the 2016 ''DC Comics Rebirth Christmas Special'' story \"The Night We Saved Christmas\".<ref>''DC Comics Rebirth Christmas Special 2016''. DC Comics</ref>\n\n===''DC Rebirth''===\nIn ''DC Rebirth'', Detective Chimp, a.k.a. Bobo, has appeared in the ''[[Dark Nights: Metal]]'' event, is one of the survivors of the invasion of the Dark Nights (alternate versions of Batman from a Dark Multiverse) and is seen at the Oblivion Bar alongside the [[Justice League]], [[Kendra Saunders]], Doctor Fate and others. Bobo's close friend Nightmaster, the owner of the Oblivion Bar, is killed in this confrontation.<ref>''Dark Nights: Metal'' #3 (October 2017)</ref> Bobo later takes over the bar and Nightmaster's mystical duties.<ref>''Justice League Dark'' #1 (2018)</ref> Bobo becomes a central part of a new mystical team called '[[Justice League Dark]]'. This is led by Wonder Woman. It includes but is not limited to, [[John Constantine]], Zatanna, Doctor Fate, Man-Bat and Swamp Thing. Bobo loses his friend the Blue Devil to mystical purists.\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nDetective Chimp possesses no unusual physical abilities, save the level of agility and [[physical strength]] that comes with being a chimpanzee with human knowledge of movement and tools. He is capable of conversing with all animals, regardless of origin, in their own language, including all spoken and written human languages. He is also one of the most highly skilled investigators in the world, with detective skills rivaling those of [[Ralph Dibny]] and [[Batman]]. Bobo has an Intelligence Quotient estimated to be higher than 98 percent of the adult (human) population, as evidenced by his [[Mensa International|Mensa]] membership and his ability to decode the [[Voynich manuscript]] which remained unsolved for over five hundred years.<ref>''Justice League Dark'' #6 (2018)</ref> Detective Chimp's hyper-intelligence has shown to have its downsides however as he has claimed it is difficult for him to concentrate without the help of alcohol to focus his mind. For a brief time, Detective Chimp also had additional sense-expanding powers granted him by the helmet of [[Doctor Fate]].\n\nBecause a chimpanzee's muscles are much denser than a human's, Detective Chimp is unable to swim. Recent scientific evidence suggests that chimpanzees can swim, and this represents a continuity error (or Detective Chimp simply never learned to swim).\n\n==Other versions==\n===''Tangent: Superman's Reign''===\nIn ''[[Tangent Comics|Tangent: Superman's Reign]]'', the Earth-9 version of Detective Chimp is revealed to be the screen name of a human hacker named [[Guy Gardner (comics)|Guy Gardner]].\n\n===''DC One Million'' and ''Dark Nights: Metal''===\nIn ''[[DC One Million]]'', the far future version of Detective Chimp is one of the heroes of the Gorilla Galaxy, and wears a costume similar to [[Batman]]'s.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Morrison, Grant| penciller= Abell, Dusty| inker= Royal, Jim| story= Crisis One Million| title= [[DC One Million|DC One Million 80-Page Giant]]| issue= #1,000,000| date= August 1999}}</ref> In 2018's ''Dark Nights: Metal'' story arc, an identical character also appears with the same name and background, although now located on the [[DC Multiverse]] alternate Earth known as Earth 52.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://comicbook.com/dc/2018/02/16/dc-comics-unveils-earth-53-in-dark-knights-rising-the-wild-hunt/|title = DC Comics Unveils Earth 53 in 'Dark Knights Rising: The Wild Hunt'|newspaper = DC}}</ref>\n\n===''Injustice: Gods Among Us''===\nDetective Chimp plays a key role in the opening issues of Year Three. [[John Constantine]] tracks down 'the world's greatest detective' - normally the moniker applied to [[Batman]] - to assist in defeating a fascistic [[Superman]]. At first, Chimp drunkenly curses Constantine, but then agrees to join him as he and Batman appear in the back of [[Chas Chandler (comics)|Chas Chandler]]'s cab, where he and John mock the brooding detectives. Constantine then leads him and Batman to a church where he has magically sealed [[Raven (DC Comics)|Raven]], much to Chimp's surprise. Chimp then asks John why he is involved in this war between Batman and Superman, but Constantine explains how the conflict with the [[Green Lantern Corps]] killed his daughter Rose's mother and he wants revenge on Superman. Batman then gathers his allies, including Chimp, at [[Etrigan the Demon|Jason Blood]]'s home, where Batman and Constantine try to explain their plan. Detective [[Harvey Bullock (comics)|Harvey Bullock]], though, announces that he plans on leaving, feeling that he is out of his element in this world of superheroes, but Chimp stops him and reveals that he knows his reputation as a detective and his work with Commissioner [[James Gordon (comics)|Gordon]] in the past on several cases. Chimp then admits he feels outside his own comfort zone but he is still here for the same reason that Gordon is and asks him to stay. Before Bullock can answer, [[Klarion the Witch Boy]]'s cat, Teekl, senses something coming as Jason realizes his home's protective seal was broken when Bullock opened the door. Before Bullock can close the door, the Spectre vaporizes both Bullock and Blood, with Chimp getting caught in the blast. [[Alfred Pennyworth]], though, manages to save Chimp as he, [[Zatanna]], and [[Harley Quinn]], manage to keep him alive, where Alfred carries his body while Zatanna teleports the others to the Tower of Fate. Chimp then awakens and grasps Harley's hand as she, Alfred, and Zatanna try to keep him alive, where it is revealed that Chimp is missing an eye. [[Doctor Fate]] then appears to take Constantine's daughter, Rose, away. Harley, though, demands Fate to help him save Chimp, but Fate says he cannot help him. Harley Quinn and Klarion the Witch Boy save Chimp's life, but Chimp loses the use of one eye and has to wear an eye patch. When Sinestro later kills Klarion, Chimp tells the assembled group that, without Klarion, he will cease to exist and fades away in front of Harley and the other rebels.\n\n==In other media==\n===Television===\n* Detective Chimp appears in the ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'', voiced by [[Kevin Michael Richardson]].
