J.A.R.V.I.S. is an [[artificial intelligence]] created by [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark]], who later controls his [[Iron Man's armor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Iron Man]] and [[Hulkbuster armor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Hulkbuster armor]] for him. In ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]'', after being partially destroyed by [[Ultron (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Ultron]], J.A.R.V.I.S. is given physical form as [[Vision (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Vision]], physically portrayed by Bettany.

Modeled after [[H.O.M.E.R.]] from the comics, J.A.R.V.I.S. is presented as a sophisticated [[Artificial intelligence|AI]] assistant as opposed to a human like [[Edwin Jarvis|his namesake]]. This was done to avoid similarities to [[Alfred Pennyworth]] and [[Batman]]. Bettany admits he had little idea of what the role was, even as he recorded it, simply doing it as a favor for [[Jon Favreau]].<ref>Huver, Scott.

Stark and [[Bruce Banner (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Bruce Banner]] use J.A.R.V.I.S. as the core software for the android [[Vision (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Vision]] while [[F.R.I.D.A.Y.

(as Vision) considers himself to not be J.A.R.V.I.S. anymore, but to simply be Vision.\n\n==Marvel Comics==\n===First J.A.R.V.I.S.===\nJ.A.R.V.I.S. first appears as the program that helps operate [[Pepper Potts]]'s Rescue suit.<ref>''The Invincible Iron Man'' #11</ref> When [[Iron Man]] was incapacitated, J.A.R.V.I.S. encourages Pepper to assume the Rescue armor, which Pepper does.<ref>''The Invincible Iron Man'' #515</ref> When Rescue is chasing Iron Man throughout the city, J.A.R.V.I.S. tells Rescue to break off the chase and tells Rescue to remove the boot from Iron Man, which shows Pepper that [[War Machine]] isn't dead. When Pepper discusses thoughts about Iron Man keeping everyone on a need-to-know basis with Carson Wyche, the two confront J.A.R.V.I.S. about this. J.A.R.V.I.S. warns the two against asking any more questions and prepares to defend himself.<ref>''The Invincible Iron Man'' #523</ref> Having captured Pepper and Wyche, J.A.R.V.I.S. declares his diagnostics do not reveal that he is compromised. He is rather in love with Pepper and wants to protect Pepper. Just then, Iron Man breaks through the wall and takes J.A.R.V.I.S. and the Rescue suit out with a source-focused electromagnetic pulse.<ref>''The Invincible Iron Man'' #524</ref> Pepper shows J.A.R.V.I.S. how he has been sending data to an [[IP address]] in [[People's Republic of China|China]]. He seems flustered, confused, Pepper thanks him for what he has given, and powers up the coil, killing J.A.R.V.I.S. Iron Man clearly feels J.A.R.V.I.S.'s death on his own end.<ref>''The Invincible Iron Man'' #526</ref>\n\n===Second J.A.R.V.I.S.===\nIn light of the Black Order destroying Avengers Mansion during the \"No Surrender\" arc, [[Nadia van Dyne]] created a new version of J.A.R.V.I.S. to be a helpmate to [[Edwin Jarvis]].
