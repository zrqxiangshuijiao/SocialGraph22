His first DCU appearance was in ''[[Vigilante (comics)|Vigilante]]'' #23 where he is introduced as the head of a police task force operating out of Midtown South. This task force's sole job is the apprehension of Vigilante (Adrian Chase) whom they believed was a cop killer.<ref>''[[Vigilante (comics)|Vigilante]]'' #23 (November 1985)</ref> Gary Washington the very first [[Checkmate (comics)|Checkmate]] Knight was also introduced during Harry Stein's run, in issue #24 as Stein's partner. In ''Vigilante'' Annual #2, Harry Stein uses illegally obtained evidence to prove Adrian Chase is the Vigilante.<ref>''Vigilante'' Annual #2 (1986)</ref> Stein admitted to illegal search and seizure and all charges against Chase were thrown out. In #37 Stein is forced to resign by his supervisor Chief Rogers and hands over his badge, Rogers informs him that there are criminal charges pending against him.<ref>''Vigilante'' #37 (January 1987)</ref>\n\nIn #37, Harry is recruited into the [[List of government agencies in DC Comics#The Agency|Agency]] by [[Valentina Vostok]], his first mission is to help a mentally unbalanced Vigilante (Adrian Chase) take down a ship full of middle eastern terrorists. During the mission, Vostok, Stein and Chase come into conflict with an equally deranged [[Peacemaker (comics)|Peacemaker]] (Christopher Smith), a man that Adrian Chase had sworn to kill.\n\nAdrian Chase becomes a cop killer, but commits suicide out of regret.\n\n===Doom Patrol===\n{{main|Doom Patrol}}\nHarry Stein shows up next in ''[[Doom Patrol]]'' (vol. 2) #2, heading for a meeting with his boss, Valentina Vostok.<ref>''[[Doom Patrol]]'' (vol. 2) #2 (November 1987)</ref> Harry later makes it inside Kalki's complex (father of [[Celsius (comics)|Celsius]]), and shuts down the electrical plant long enough for the Doom Patrol to free themselves from Kalki's traps.<ref>''Doom Patrol'' (vol. 2) #3 (December 1987)</ref> Harry promises to leave any mention of [[Joshua Clay]]'s double identity as doctor Johnathan Carmichael out of his reports.<ref>''Doom Patrol'' (vol. 2) #4 (January 1988)</ref> Harry later informs the Doom Patrol that the Agency needed them to rescue an American superhero who had been taken hostage in [[San Salvador]].<ref>''Doom Patrol'' (vol. 2) #5 (February 1988)</ref>\n\n===Checkmate===\n{{main|Checkmate (comics)}}\nHarry Stein is appointed Valentina Vostok's replacement in the Agency's command position by [[Amanda Waller]]. Stein later sought out the most stable personnel available from the American and international intelligence and law enforcement communities to form Checkmate. His agency would field only the best-trained and well-equipped of agents, working under the strictest rules of secrecy. For the organizational structure of the re-organized Agency, Stein chose the game of [[chess]] as his working model.<ref>''[[Action Comics]]'' #598 (March 1988)</ref> \n\nStein brought in Gary Washington (Knight One) and [[Black Thorn (comics)|Black Thorn]] as operatives, both of whom were his friends, and both of whom were introduced during his run on Vigilante. Harry Stein's sons Barry and Matthew are introduced in ''Checkmate'' #2.\n\nOn a rare vacation with his sons, Harry confronts a murderous gang of thieves robbing the payroll of a popular and extensive amusement park. Harry deals with the gang, mostly on his own. Months later, he almost loses one of his sons to a killer's bullet. Harry Stein's last recorded appearance was in ''Checkmate'' #33 (January 1991), the final issue of the original series.\n\n==Notes==\n* When first introduced in ''Vigilante'' #23 and throughout his run in that series, Harry was drawn as slovenly and unshaven, in the mould of [[Harvey Bullock (comics)|Harvey Bullock]].\n* In ''Action Comics'' #598 and ''Checkmate'' #2, Harry is shown as a clean cut level headed father.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.dcuguide.com/chronology.php?name=harrystein DCU Guide: Harry Stein chronology]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070304095523/http://www.dcuguide.com/Sm/Act_598.php DCU Guide: ''Action Comics'' #598]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20061219071408/http://www.dcuguide.com/Ckmt/Ckmt_001.php DCU Guide: ''Checkmate'' #1]\n*[http://www.cosmicteams.com/cosmic/c.html#checkmate Cosmic Teams: Checkmate]\n*[http://members.tripod.com/doompatrolreview/doompatrol2.htm The Doom Patrol Review: ''Doom Patrol'' (Volume Two)]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Stein, Harry}}\n[[Category:Characters created by Paul Kupperberg]]\n[[Category:DC Comics superheroes]]\n[[Category:Fictional New York City Police Department lieutenants]]"}]}}}}
