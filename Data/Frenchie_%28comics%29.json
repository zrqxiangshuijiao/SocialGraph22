He is primarily seen as the [[aviator|pilot]] and [[sidekick]] to [[Moon Knight]].\n\n==Publication history==\nThe character first appeared in ''[[Werewolf by Night]]'' #32, in August 1975, which also featured the first appearance of [[Moon Knight]]. The character would next appear in ''[[Defenders (comics)|The Defenders]]'' issue 49, in July 1977, becoming a recurring character in the 1980 ''Moon Knight'' series, and the 1989 series ''Marc Spector: Moon Knight''. The character also played a significant role in the 2006 ''Moon Knight'' series and was also featured in the 2009 series ''Vengeance of the Moon Knight''.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://comicbookdb.com/character_chron.php?ID=10609 |title=Comic Book DB - Frenchie (Marvel) |access-date=2010-03-22 |archive-date=2012-11-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121107094312/http://comicbookdb.com/character_chron.php?ID=10609 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The character would later reappear in the 2016 ''Moon Knight'' series where he is one of the mental patients in an insane asylum in [[New York City]] alongside [[Marc Spector]], [[List of Marvel Comics characters#B|Bertand Crawley]], [[List of Marvel Comics characters#G|Gena Landers]], [[List of Marvel Comics characters#M|Marlene Alraune]] and others.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nFrenchie was originally romantically involved with a woman named Isabelle Kristel, but she later left him. After this, he became a mercenary, where he encountered [[Moon Knight|Marc Spector]] and [[Bushman (comics)|Raoul Bushman]]. Once Spector became Moon Knight, Frenchie helped him fight Bushman, who had betrayed them. He would later design and build Moon Knight\u2019s Mooncopter.\n\nFrenchie then went undercover in order to infiltrate the crime organization the Committee, under the alias '''Monsieur LeBlanc''', which allowed Moon Knight to bring down the organization.\n\nFrenchie was later crippled when Moon Knight\u2019s brother [[Shadow Knight (comics)|Randall Spector]] caused an explosion at Moon Knight\u2019s [[mansion]]. His girlfriend Chloe Tran also informed him that he carried the bloodline of the Hellbent, a race of supernatural beings, and that he has the ability to transform into his ancestors.\n\nAfter being driven away by Moon Knight, Frenchie became partners with Rob Silverman, and they opened and ran a restaurant called ''En Table''. It is revealed he is gay, and was attracted to Marc. [[Norman Osborn]] learned that Frenchie was an associate of Moon Knight, and sent a gang to kill him and Silverman in order to provoke Moon Knight. The attack left Silverman in critical condition, which caused Frenchie and Moon Knight to again join forces and attack the gang who attacked them.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://marvel.com/universe/Frenchie_(DuChamp,_Jean-Paul)|title = Frenchie (Jean-Paul DuChamp) Powers, Enemies, History &#124; Marvel}}</ref>\n \nIn his most recent appearance, Frenchie is called on by Moon Knight to watch over Marc\u2019s daughter, Diatrice Alraune.\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nFrenchie is a skilled pilot and an above average hand-to-hand combatant.\n\n==In other media==\n* Frenchie is featured as an ally in the Moon Knight virtual pinball game for [[Pinball FX 2]] released by [[Zen Studios]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marvel.com/news/video_games/17036/moon_knight_joins_marvel_pinball_vengeance_and_virtue|title=Moon Knight Joins Marvel Pinball: Vengeance and Virtue|publisher=www.marvel.com|date=|access-date=2016-04-18}}{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n* DuChamp's (spelled Duchamp) name appears in the first episode of ''[[Moon Knight (TV series)|Moon Knight]]'' when Steven Grant finds a phone that belonged to Marc Spector in his flat and checks his missed calls.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.denofgeek.com/tv/moon-knight-jean-paul-duchamp/|title=Moon Knight: Will Jean-Paul Duchamp Be In the Show?|publisher=www.denofgeek.com|date=30 March 2022|access-date=2022-03-30}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://marvel.com/universe/Frenchie_(DuChamp,_Jean-Paul) Frenchie] at Marvel.com\n* [http://marvel.wikia.com/wiki/Jean-Paul_Duchamp_(Earth-616) Frenchie] at Marvel Wiki\n* [http://comicvine.gamespot.com/frenchie/29-27829/ Frenchie] at Comic Vine\n* {{comicbookdb|character|10609|title=Frenchie}}\n\n{{Moon Knight}}\n\n[[Category:Marvel Comics male characters]]\n[[Category:1975 comics debuts]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics LGBT characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional French people]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics sidekicks]]\n[[Category:Fictional aviators]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Doug Moench]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Don Perlin]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1975]]"}]}}}}
