The character was created by [[Marvel UK]] a division of [[Marvel Comics]].\n\n==Publication history==\n{{expand section|date=November 2015}}\nThunderclap first appeared in ''Spider-Man Weekly'' #607 (October 1984), and was created by [[Mike Collins (comics)|Mike Collins]] and [[Barry Kitson]].\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nBorn in [[West Bromwich]], [[England]], Stanley George Johnson was a struggling electronics salesman until he decided to cannibalize together other people's technology to create a pair of hydraulically powered gloves that could create [[sonic boom]]s.<ref name=\"battledamage\"/> Soon, he left England for [[New York, New York]] and took the name Thunderclap.\n\nThunderclap's first appearance on the superhero scene comes when [[Spider-Man]] is trying to help police officers prevent a robber from escaping. As Spider-Man is about to stop the disaster, Thunderclap intervenes, slamming his hands together to create sonic booms that cause massive property damage while stopping the burglars. Spider-Man leaves after lecturing Thunderclap, and Thunderclap apologizes to the police for the damage he has caused. When the press arrive, however, Thunderclap introduces himself and blames Spider-Man for the property damage. Thunderclap is declared a true hero by the ''[[Daily Bugle]].<ref>''Spider-Man Weekly'' #607</ref>\n\n===Civil War===\n{{Main|Civil War (comics)}}\nYears later, during the ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'' storyline, Thunderclap is seen battling the superhero [[Bantam (comics)|Bantam]]. The fight, which is witnessed by [[Sally Floyd (comics)|Sally Floyd]], is over Thunderclap's refusal to comply with the [[Superhuman Registration Act]] and Bantam's efforts to bring him in. The battle concludes when Thunderclap knocks Bantam into a gas truck, which explodes and kills him. Thunderclap tries to apologize but, feeling too ashamed, disappears into a nearby alley. Floyd, in a later issue of ''Frontline'', wonders about the convenience of the gas truck being so close to the battle.<ref>''Civil War: Frontline'' #3</ref>\n\n==Equipment==\nThunderclap's piston-like metal gloves are connected to a hydraulic device in the back of his suit which uses potential and kinetic energy that allow the gloves to collide together faster than the [[speed of sound]]. The resulting sonic boom (approximately 2000 decibels) is released outwards in a destructive energy sphere which strikes any matter with which it comes into contact with tremendous impact.<ref name=\"battledamage\"/>\n\nThe sonic boom also has the tendency to temporarily deafen and disorientate anyone in the immediate area. Thunderclap's [[cowl]] is outfitted with protective silicone cups on the sides and an electronic device which muffle the sound of his sonic booms while amplifying quieter sounds to higher decibel levels.<ref name=\"battledamage\"/>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n*[http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/thunderclapsm.htm Thunderclap] at the Appendix to the Handbook of the Marvel Universe\n*{{comicbookdb|type=character|id=6670|title=Thunderclap}}\n{{refend}}\n\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1984]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics superheroes]]\n[[Category:Marvel UK characters]]"}]}}}}
