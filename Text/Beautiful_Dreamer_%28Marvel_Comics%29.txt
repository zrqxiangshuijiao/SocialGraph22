Her real name and past prior to joining the Morlocks are unknown. She followed the terrorist Morlock leader [[Masque (comics)|Masque]] for a time and committed criminal acts by manipulating others with her mental powers at his behest. However, Beautiful Dreamer's primary motivation for doing so, as with most of her fellow Morlocks, is presumed to be her desire for company and community. \n\nDreamer appeared in the first season of [[The Gifted (season 1)|''The Gifted'']] played by [[Elena Satine]].\n\n==Publication history==\nBeautiful Dreamer's first appearance was in ''Power Pack'' #12 (July 1985), and she was created by [[Louise Simonson]] and [[June Brigman]].\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nDreamer, along with several other Morlocks, confronts the [[Power Pack]], when the young team enters the [[New York City]] sewers to look for their lost school books. The empathic Annalee, mourning her deceased children, wishes to have Beautiful Dreamer alter the memories of Power Pack. The goal is to have the Power Pack believe Annalee is their mother. Two of the X-Men, Nightcrawler and Kitty Pryde, stop this plan.<ref>''Power Pack'' #12</ref>\n\nWhen the Morlock leader Callisto had left for a time, [[Masque (comics)|Masque]] decides to re-implement Annalee's desires. The Power Pack's parents have their memories altered and ultimately, three of the Pack. The last member, Energizer, summons help from the X-Men. Callisto returns in time to undo the plan and Beautiful Dreamer restores the minds of all affected.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #195</ref>\n\nBeautiful Dreamer was among the few members of the [[Morlocks (comics)|Morlocks]] to survive the [[Marauders (comics)|Marauders]]' \"[[Mutant Massacre]]\", during which most members of her community were killed.<ref>''X-Factor'' #9</ref> She stays with [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]], for a while, along with her friends, [[Tar Baby (comics)|Tar Baby]], [[Ape (comics)|Ape]], and [[Erg (comics)|Erg]].<ref>''X-Factor'' #10-11</ref>\n\nThere was a brief conflict with another group of Morlocks, as all of them do not get along. Dreamer's group eventually returns to the sewers in an attempt to create a new life for themselves.<ref>''X-Factor'' #12</ref>\n\nBeautiful Dreamer is one of the 198 mutants who retained their powers after the events of [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]].<ref>''X-Men: The 198 Files'' #1</ref>\n\nBeautiful Dreamer was one of the mutants who heard [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]]'s psychic call to come to San Francisco and was going there, but she was captured by [[Bastion (comics)|Bastion]]'s [[Purifiers (Marvel Comics)|Purifiers]] and injected with the [[Legacy Virus]]. She was delivered by the [[Leper Queen]] to a [[Friends of Humanity]] anti-mutant rally held in Iowa, where the virus activated her powers to the extreme, killing all of the people attending the rally by making their brains \"forget\" to pump their hearts; she eventually died as well because of the virus.<ref>As revealed in ''X-Force'' vol. 2 #12</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nBeautiful Dreamer possesses the ability to psionically alter the memories of others using her special \"dream smoke\" as a focus.\n\n==In other media==\n[[File:Actress Elena Satine (cropped - Medium shot).jpg|thumb|150px|[[Elena Satine]] portrays Dreamer in ''[[The Gifted (U.S. TV series)|The Gifted]]'']]\n* \"Beautiful Dreamer\" is played by [[Elena Satine]] in Fox's ''[[The Gifted (U.S. TV series)|The Gifted]]'' series.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cbr.com/the-gifted-trailer-casts-dreamer/|title = The Gifted Releases New Trailer, Casts SHIELD Star as Dreamer|date = 9 August 2017}}</ref> Like her comic book counterpart, she is a mutant with the ability to exhale pink smoke that allows her to read, take, or implant memories into the minds of her targets.
