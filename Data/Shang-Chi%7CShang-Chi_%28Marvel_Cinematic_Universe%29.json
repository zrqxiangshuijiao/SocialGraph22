The character was created by writer [[Steve Englehart]] and artist [[Jim Starlin]], debuting in ''Special Marvel Edition'' #15 (December 1973) in the [[Bronze Age of Comic Books]], and starring in his own solo title until 1983. Described as the greatest martial artist alive, Shang-Chi has been trained since birth to be the ultimate fighter with a specialization in various unarmed and weaponry-based [[Chinese martial arts|''wushu'']] styles, including the use of the ''[[Gun (staff)|g\u00f9n]]'', ''[[nunchaku]]'', and ''[[jian]]''.  Shang-Chi later assumes leadership of the [[Five Weapons Society]] and acquires the [[Mandarin's rings#Ten Rings (Ta-Lo)|Ten Rings]] weapons.\n\nShang-Chi was spun off from novelist [[Sax Rohmer]]'s licensed property as the unknown son of fictional villain [[Zheng Zu|Dr. Fu Manchu]]. In later editions, his connection to Dr. Fu Manchu was underplayed after Marvel lost the comic book rights to the latter's character; to get around this problem, the publisher eventually renamed Shang-Chi's father Zheng Zu.\n\n[[Shang-Chi (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Shang-Chi]] made his live-action debut in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] film ''[[Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings]]'' (2021), where he is portrayed by [[Simu Liu]].\n\n==Publication history==\nIn the early 1970s, writer [[Steve Englehart]] and artist [[Jim Starlin]] approached [[DC Comics]] to adapt the television series ''[[Kung Fu (1972 TV series)|Kung Fu]]'' into a comic book, as DC's parent company, [[Warner Communications]], owned the rights to the series. DC Comics, however, was not interested in their pitch, believing the show's and the [[martial arts]] genre popularity would fade quickly. The duo then approached [[Marvel Comics]] with the idea to create a [[kung fu]]-focused original comic. Editor-in-chief [[Roy Thomas]] agreed, but only if they would include the [[Sax Rohmer]]'s pulp villain [[Fu Manchu|Dr. Fu Manchu]], as Marvel had previously acquired the comic book rights to the character, and made their protagonist [[Eurasian (mixed ancestry)|half-white]]. Englehart and Starlin agreed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2021/09/04/entertainment/shang-chi-marvel-comics-history-cec/index.html|title = Inside Shang-Chi's evolution from forgotten comic book character to big-screen superhero}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= https://universohq.com/english/jim-starlin-success-written-stars/|title= A success written in the stars|date= March 3, 2001|publisher= [[Universo HQ]]|access-date = September 8, 2021}}</ref> They developed Shang-Chi, a master of kung fu, who was introduced as a previously unknown son of Dr. Fu Manchu.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Sanderson |first1=Peter |title=Marvel Chronicle A Year by Year History |last2=Gilbert |first2=Laura |publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] |year=2008 |isbn=978-0756641238 |location=London, United Kingdom |page=161 |chapter=1970s |quote=Capitalizing on the popularity of martial arts movies, writer Steve Englehart and artist/co-plotter Jim Starlin created Marvel's ''Master of Kung Fu'' series.

Marvel Comics.</ref><ref name=\":4\" />  \n\nWhile adventuring in [[Ta-Lo]], Shang-Chi acquired the heavenly [[Mandarin's rings#Ten Rings (Ta-Lo)|Ten Rings]] from the Jade Emperor, granting him a variety of powers and abilities, including superhuman strength, speed, durability and stamina, as well as allowing him to fly and levitate.<ref name=\":4\" /><ref name=\":5\" /> Shang-Chi can control the Rings telepathically which can be used in a variety of ways, including launching them as projectiles, utilizing them as platforms for transportation and generating makeshift chains to grab objects and restrain opponents.<ref name=\":5\" /> The Ten Rings can also alter their size, either shrinking down to fit Shang-Chi's wrists or enlarge themselves to ensnare a human.<ref name=\":5\" /> When Shang-Chi first wore the Ten Rings, his fear of their power corrupting him allowed Chieftain Xin to take control of the Rings away from him. However, when Shang-Chi gave in to his desire, he was able to reclaim the Ten Rings and unlock their potential, increasing his strength and abilities but giving him a similar likeness and personality of his father. Although Shang-Chi was able to completely fight off his father's influence, the Ten Rings still retained their unlocked power and loyalty to him.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n==Other versions==\n===\"Secret Wars\" (2015)===\nIn the 2015 \"[[Secret Wars (2015)|Secret Wars]]\" storyline, a version of Shang-Chi resides in the [[wuxia]]-inspired [[K'un-Lun]] region of [[Battleworld]]. In this continuity, he is the exiled son of Emperor '''[[Zheng Zu#Secret Wars (2015)|Zheng Zu]], Master of the Ten Rings''', a ruthless martial arts school that uses mystical powers and techniques based on [[Mandarin's rings|the powers of the Mandarin's ten rings]] from the [[Earth-616|mainstream continuity]]. Shang-Chi is wanted for the murder of Lord Tuan, the master of the [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]] school, the main rivals of the Ten Rings school. A drunk vagabond, Shang-Chi is approached by [[Kitty Pryde|Kitten]] to help teach her and her group of fellow outcasts who had been exiled from each of their respective schools the techniques of the Ten Rings. Ashamed by his upbringing, Shang-Chi coldly refuses and insults the group, outraging their leader, [[Callisto (comics)|Callisto]], who informs the emperor of Shang-Chi's whereabouts. The gang's hideout raided by K'un Lun's sheriff and Tuan's student [[Iron Fist (comics)|Rand-K'ai]], the emperor's assassin [[Elektra (comics)|Red Sai]] of the [[The Hand (comics)|Red Hand]] school and Ten Rings enforcer [[Taskmaster (comics)|Laughing Skull]] but after Laughing Skull kills outcast [[Cypher (comics)|Cy]] against Rand-K'ai's orders, Shang-Chi helps the group escape with the '''Nightbringer''' technique. A guilt ridden Shang-Chi agrees to take the outcasts as his pupils, dubbing their new school '''The Lowest Caste'''. Shang-Chi returns from his exile to represent the Lowest Caste for the tournament held every thirteen years to decide which participating master would be the next ruler of K'un-Lun. Zu allows Shang-Chi to participate but alters the rules so Shang-Chi would have to defeat every representative before facing him in the Thirteen Chambers. After defeating [[Namor]], [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Drew]], [[Karnak (comics)|Karnak]], [[Betsy Braddock|Lady Mandarin]], [[White Tiger (Ava Ayala)|Ava]], [[Sabretooth (comics)|Creed]], [[Moon Knight|Spector]] and [[Black Panther (comics)|T'Challa]] in consecutive matches, Shang-Chi encounters Rand-K'ai and Red Sai in the penultimate match of the Thirteen Chambers. During the fight, Red Sai confesses that Zu had sent her to assassinate his rival Tuan but ultimately failed. To spare his lover and her students from the emperor's wrath, Shang-Chi killed Tuan; Zu implicated and exiled his son for the murder to cover his own involvement. After the truth is revealed, Red Sai and Rand-K'ai let Shang-Chi pass so that he could defeat his father. During the fight between Shang-Chi and Zheng Zu, Zu attempts to kill his son with the '''Spectral Touch''' technique, only for the move to pass through him due to Shang-Chi learning Kitten's [[Kitty Pryde#Powers and abilities|technique to become intangible]]. Shang-Chi proceeds to use nine of the Ten Ring techniques against his father and ultimately defeats him with '''[[Gorgon (Tomi Shishido)|The Gorgon's Eye]]''', which turns him into stone. With Zu's defeat, Shang-Chi becomes the new emperor of K'un-Lun.<ref name=\"MoKF2\">{{cite comic|writer= Blackman, Haden|penciller= Talaji\u0107, Dalibor|inker= Sudzuka, Goran|story= Chapter Two: Master's Son|title= Master of Kung Fu|volume= 2|issue= #2|date= August 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"MoKF4\">{{cite comic|writer= Blackman, Haden|penciller= Talaji\u0107, Dalibor|inker= Talaji\u0107, Dalibor|story= Chapter Four: Master and Apprentice|title= Master of Kung Fu|volume= 2|issue= #4|date= October 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite comic|writer= Blackman, Haden|penciller= Talaji\u0107, Dalibor|inker= Sudzuka, Goran|story= Chapter One: Master Drunk|title=Master of Kung Fu|volume= 2|issue= #1|date= July 2015}}<br>{{cite comic|writer= Blackman, Haden|penciller= Talaji\u0107, Dalibor|inker= Sudzuka, Goran|story= Chapter Three: Masters All|title=Master of Kung Fu|volume= 2|issue= #3|date= September 2015}}</ref>\n\n===\"House of M\"===\nIn the alternate timeline of the \"[[House of M]]\" storyline, Shang-Chi never realizes his father's evil doings before his death at Magneto's hands.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Christos Gage|Gage, Christos]]|penciller= [[Mike Perkins|Perkins, Mike]]|inker= [[Andrew Hennessy|Hennessy, Andrew]]; Perkins, Mike|title= [[House of M]]: Avengers|issue= #2|date= February 2008}}</ref> This causes him to become consumed with a desire for vengeance.

The trio are taken to the Ten Rings' compound, where Wenwu reveals that he believes Li is still alive and is being kept in Ta Lo, using the two pendants to create a map that can be used to enter the village. Wenwu plans to destroy the village after freeing Li and imprisons Shang-Chi and the others when they object to his plans.\n\nThe trio escape the compound with the help of [[Trevor Slattery]] and his [[hundun]] companion Morris and drive to Ta Lo to warn the village of the Ten Rings.

Shang-Chi is revived by the Great Protector and uses his newfound powers to disarm Wenwu.\n\nAfter the Dweller escapes its seal, Wenwu sacrifices himself to save Shang-Chi from the Dweller and bequeaths the ten rings to Shang-Chi, who uses them and the Ta Lo fighting style to destroy the Dweller. Shang-Chi later makes a paper lantern and lights it in memory of his father.\n\nBack in San Francisco, Shang-Chi and Katy are summoned by the sorcerer [[Wong (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Wong]] to accompany him to [[Kamar-Taj (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Kamar-Taj]], where they are introduced to [[Bruce Banner (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Bruce Banner]] and [[Carol Danvers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Carol Danvers]] via hologram. Wong, Banner, and Danvers discover that the rings are emitting a mysterious signal and Wong vows to keep looking into it. Shang-Chi then suggests they go to a bar, and he, Katy, and Wong sing karaoke together.\n\n==Reception==\nKaren Rought of ''Hypable'' praised the decision to have Shang-Chi already know who he is and what he can do from the very beginning, contrasting with many familiar [[Origin story|origin stories]] seen in other comic-book movies. Of this, Rought noted that \"yes, this is an origin story, but it was more about self-acceptance than self-discovery...that was a breath of fresh air for the first film about a new character in the MCU.\" She described Liu's take on the character to \"offers us a perfect dichotomy in his role...He's a kind-faced, goofy, normal guy who hides a secret.\"<ref>{{Cite web |date=September 6, 2021 |title='Shang-Chi' movie review: Marvel introduces a whole new world |url=https://www.hypable.com/shang-chi-movie-review/ |access-date=September 12, 2021 |website=Hypable |language=en-US |archive-date=June 11, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220611094112/https://www.hypable.com/shang-chi-movie-review/ |url-status=live }}</ref> Justin Chang of [[NPR]] was drawn into the character by his complicated relationship with Wenwu, saying that \"[Shang-Chi] has a complicated, vaguely Oedipal rivalry with his father, who turned him into the fighting machine he is and subjected him to all manner of cruel manipulation and abuse\", demarking the character's \"depths of...trauma\".<ref>{{Cite news |title=Marvel's 1st Asian Superhero Gets The Full Blockbuster Treatment In 'Shang-Chi' |language=en |work=NPR.org |url=https://www.npr.org/2021/09/01/1032875594/shang-chi-review-marvels-1st-asian-superhero |access-date=September 12, 2021 |archive-date=February 22, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220222075215/https://www.npr.org/2021/09/01/1032875594/shang-chi-review-marvels-1st-asian-superhero |url-status=live }}</ref> Herb Scribner of ''Deseret'' called Shang-Chi \"absolutely excellent\" and that \"he needs to be around for Marvel films for the foreseeable future.\" Scribner felt that \"as Shang-Chi, Liu walks the line of a young man trying to find his way and a vulnerable young boy trying to find his family\" and compared the character favorably to other leading characters in the MCU including [[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thor]] and Bruce Banner.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Scribner |first=Herb |date=August 23, 2021 |title='Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings' is your next favorite Marvel movie |url=https://www.deseret.com/2021/8/23/22634154/shang-chi-legend-of-the-ten-rings-review |access-date=September 12, 2021 |website=Deseret News |language=en |archive-date=November 19, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211119124638/https://www.deseret.com/2021/8/23/22634154/shang-chi-legend-of-the-ten-rings-review |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nAfter comments from a 2017 interview in which Liu referencing that his parents told him that China was a \"third world\" country where people were \"dying of starvation\",a Chinese release for ''Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings'' thus became unlikely.
