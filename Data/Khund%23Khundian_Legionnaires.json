They first appeared in ''Adventure Comics'' #346 (July 1966), as enemies of the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]] in the 30th century.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Greenberger |first1=Robert |last2=Pasko |first2=Martin |title=The Essential Superman Encyclopedia |date=2010 |publisher=Del Rey |isbn=978-0-345-50108-0 |page=162}}</ref>\n\n==Fictional history==\nThe Khunds controlled a vast galactic empire. In the 30th and the 31st centuries, their relationship with the [[United Planets]] fluctuated between uneasy d\u00e9tente and open warfare. When the U.P. first discovered the Khundian civilization, the Khunds responded by attempting to conquer Earth. They nearly succeeded with the assistance of [[Nemesis Kid]], a saboteur whom they planted in the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]].  Nemesis Kid was exposed and the invasion was repelled.<ref>''[[Adventure Comics]]'' (vol. 1) #346-347 (July\u2013August 1966)</ref>\n\nThe Khunds opposed the U.P. and the Legion at numerous times in the future. For example, the Khunds and the [[Dark Circle]] invaded Earth during the so-called \"[[Earthwar]]\". It was soon revealed that both groups were being manipulated by the sorcerer [[Mordru]], who almost conquered Earth before being defeated by the Legion.<ref>''Superboy and the Legion of Super-Heroes'' #241-245 (July\u2013November 1978)</ref>\n\n===Khundian Legionnaires===\nDuring the [[Legion of Super-Heroes#\"Five Years Later\"|\"Five Years Later\"]] arc of Legion continuity, Mordru casts a massive spell allowing him to animate and control the corpses of dead warriors throughout United Planets territory, and use them as an invasion force.  U.P. worlds which were conquered by the Khundian empire are not spared from this phenomenon, prompting the Khunds to form a temporary alliance with the Legion. Four superpowered Khunds join the Legion: '''Firefist''', a cyborg; his wife '''Veilmist''', a teleporter; '''Blood Claw''', who possesses indestructible claws; and '''Flederweb''', a winged bounty hunter.<ref>''Legion of Super-Heroes'' (vol. 4) #44 (June 1993)</ref>\n\nIncluded in the animated undead force that invaded the planet Sklar are corpses of the many deceased members of the Legion.  Blood Claw is killed by Magnetic Kid's undead body.<ref>''Legion of Super-Heroes'' (vol. 4) #46 (August 1993)</ref> Firefist attempts to murder [[Devlin O'Ryan]], but is seemingly killed himself when Devlin's reflective power repels the Khund's weapon blast back at him.<ref>''Legion of Super-Heroes'' (vol. 4) #47 (September 1993)</ref> The group manages to defeat Mordru, and the Khunds force Veilmist and Flederweb to resign from the Legion.<ref>''Legion of Super-Heroes'' (vol. 4) #48 (October 1993)</ref> Some time later, it is revealed that Firefist survived,<ref name = \"LSH57\">''Legion of Super-Heroes'' (vol. 4) #57 (May 1994)</ref> and that the Khunds have initiated a plot to destroy [[Weber's World]].  Veilmist offers to assist the Legion in foiling the plot, but is killed by Firefist.<ref>''Legion of Super-Heroes'' (vol. 4) #58 (June 1994)</ref>  Flederweb is revealed to be not a Khund, but a mind-controlled member of an unspecified alien race.<ref name = \"LSH57\"/>  After he is freed from Khundian control and helps the Legion save Weber's World, Flederweb joins the [[Heroes of Lallor]].<ref>''Legion of Super-Heroes'' (vol. 4) #59 (July 1994)</ref>\n\nThe events of the \"Five Years Later\" era were erased from mainstream DC continuity following the ''[[Zero Hour: Crisis in Time|Zero Hour]]'' limited series. Thus, the saga of the Khundian Legionnaires is currently viewed as non-canonical. However, Veilmist, Firefist, and a shot of Flederweb's arm appeared in ''[[Final Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds]]'' #5, among dozens of Legionnaires pulled out of alternate realities.<ref>''Final Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds'' #5</ref>\n\n===20th and 21st centuries===\nDuring the 20th and 21st centuries, the Khunds were extreme enemies of the Thanagarians because of their planetary proximity.<ref>''[[Legends (comics)|Legends]]''</ref> They superficially resemble [[human]]s, but average larger and more muscular in build, with pale [[magenta]] skin. Khunds have codified rules of combat. Khund bodies have much denser bone and muscle tissue than humans. The planet Khundia is a heavy gravity world.<ref>As seen in ''Adventure Comics'' #346 (July 1966)</ref> The Khunds were part of the alien group that attacks Earth in the ''[[Invasion! (DC Comics)|Invasion!]]'' crossover.<ref>''Invasion!'' #1-3 (January\u2013March 1989)</ref> In ''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 3) #19 the Khund homeworld had been devastated by the attack of the aliens called 'Ichor'. With the assistance of [[Etta Candy]] and [[Wonder Woman]], the Khund homeworld is saved and they gain their own [[Green Lantern]] protector.\n\n==In other media==\n===Television===\n* The Khunds are seen in the \"Shadow of the Hawk\" episode of the ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' series. They were fought by [[Hawkgirl|Shayera]] and [[Elongated Man]] back in the early years of the reformed Justice League.\n* An unnamed K'hund (spelt with an apostrophe, but still pronounced {{IPAc-en|k|\u028c|n|d}}) appears in \"[[Falling (Supergirl)|Falling]]\", the sixteenth episode of the first season of [[Supergirl (TV series)|''Supergirl'']]. Supergirl attempts to capture the K'hund for the [[Department of Extranormal Operations|Department of Extra-Normal Operations]]. Under the influence of [[kryptonite#Forms, colors and their effects|red kryptonite]], however, she deliberately allows him to escape. He is later apprehended by the DEO without Supergirl's help. In the season finale, \"[[Myriad (Supergirl)|Myriad]]\", the K'hund escaped as [[Brainiac 8|Brainiac-8/Indigo]] and [[Non (comics)|Non]] broke every DEO prisoner out.\n\n===Film===\n* In the animated film ''[[Green Lantern: Emerald Knights]]'', the Khunds (known as Khundians in the film) are involved in the backstories of [[Kilowog]] and Laira Omoto.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.maison-otaku.net/~rhea/GE/khund.html More info on Khunds] (be warned this site links Larry Niven's [[Kzinti]] into Khund history)\n\n{{Legion of Super-Heroes}}\n\n[[Category:DC Comics alien species]]\n[[Category:Legion of Super-Heroes]]"}]}}}}
