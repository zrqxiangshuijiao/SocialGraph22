This was because, for reasons not revealed, he could not leave Wintersgate Manor, the labyrinthine mansion in Washington, D.C. where he lived.

I really wanted to try something different and thought I had solved the problem of doing an [[anthology series]] by doing it with continued characters. The idea was to write for the older audience, with darker and more realistic stories than had been done at that point.<ref name=\"Back27\"/>}}\n\n''Night Force'' was the first collaboration between Wolfman and ''Tomb of Dracula'' penciler [[Gene Colan]] since Wolfman convinced him to join the staff at DC. Both Wolfman and Colan did extensive creative design work for ''Night Force'' before working on the actual issues, with Wolfman charting out the characters' astrology and Colan doing multiple drafts of each character's visual design.<ref name=\"Back27\"/>\n\nAfter only 14 issues, ''Night Force'' was cancelled due to an underestimating of the series's sales. Wolfman explained, \"... DC wanted to have ''Night Force'' be one of the first direct-sales books, where I believed it should be [[newsstand]] only. I felt the [[comic shop]]s appealed primarily to the [[superhero]] fans while ''Night Force'' would appeal more to the casual mainstream reader, who might not have bought comics otherwise. We got the comic-book shops' sales early and it was canceled based on those, but when the newsstand sales finally dribbled in we actually sold pretty well\".<ref name=\"Back27\"/>\n\nThirteen years later, ''Night Force'' was revived as part of the [[Weirdoverse]] line. The creative team included Wolfman but not Colan, and did not carry over the plot threads from the original series.<ref name=\"Back27\"/>\n\n==Characters==\nThe team had a rotating membership, but notable members included:\n* Vanessa Van Helsing&nbsp;\u2013 Granddaughter of [[Abraham Van Helsing]] and a powerful psychic.\n* Jack Gold&nbsp;\u2013 Vanessa's husband, a reporter.\n* Donovan Caine&nbsp;\u2013 A professor of parapsychology who lost an arm and a leg on one of the missions.\n* Zadok Grimm&nbsp;\u2013 Apparently, an ancient warrior in the time of [[King David]]. He has an unexplained connection to Baron Winters.\n\n==Other versions==\nIn issue three of the ''[[Tangent Comics|Tangent]]: Superman's Reign'' series, a version of Night Force is featured. This group is a mystically-powered branch of the [[Nightwing]] organization, and its members are [[Jonah Hex|Hex]], [[Black Orchid (character)|Black Orchid]], and [[Wildcat (DC Comics)|Wildcat]].\n\n==In other media==\n* The character of '''Jasper Winters''', mentioned in several episodes of ''[[Constantine (TV series)|Constantine]]'', was loosely based on Baron Winters, although the look is modernized.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://comicbook.com/2014/10/25/constantine-premiere-easter-eggs-and-dc-comics-references/|title=Constantine Premiere Easter Eggs and DC Comics References|website=ComicBook|first=Russ|last=Burlingame|date=October 24, 2014|access-date=December 27, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{comicbookdb|type=team|id=380|title=Night Force}}\n*{{gcdb series|id=2633|title=Night Force vol. 1}}\n*{{gcdb series|id=12196|title=Night Force vol. 2}}\n*{{gcdb series|id=63916|title=Night Force vol. 3}}\n*[http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Night_Force Night Force] at the DC Database Project\n\n[[Category:Characters created by Marv Wolfman]]\n[[Category:Comics by Marv Wolfman]]"}]}}}}
