The series, written by [[Steve Gerber]] and [[Mary Skrenes]] and illustrated by [[Jim Mooney]], ran for 10 issues before cancellation for low sales. Despite its short run, it has remained as a [[cult classic]] due to its intriguing characters and unusual storytelling. A 10-issue series revamping the character was published from 2007 to 2008, written by novelist [[Jonathan Lethem]] and illustrated by [[Farel Dalrymple]].\n\n==Creation and concept==\nUnlike many other [[superhero]] titles, the main focus of ''Omega the Unknown'' is not on the superpowered person in an iconic costume and cape. Instead the story largely deals with an unusually mature 12-year-old boy named James-Michael Starling.<ref>{{cite book|last1 = Sanderson|first1 = Peter|author-link = Peter Sanderson|last2= Gilbert|first2= Laura, ed.|chapter= 1970s|title = Marvel Chronicle A Year by Year History|publisher= [[Dorling Kindersley]]|date = 2008|location= London, United Kingdom|page = 175|isbn =978-0756641238|quote= In March [1976], a new super hero series began called ''Omega the Unknown'', created by writers Steve Gerber and Mary Skrenes and artist Jim Mooney.

He escapes the mechanical beings who have devastated his planet in a ship headed to Earth.  The story then cuts to James-Michael waking up in bed having dreamed the events that just occurred with Omega.\n\nIn his waking world, James-Michael and his parents are moving to New York City from the mountains so he can improve his socialization skills after years of home-schooling.  En route to New York the Starlings' car is driven off the road and both of James-Michael's parents are killed, but not before the boy discovers that both of them were [[robot]]s. James-Michael collapses into a coma and awakens a month later in a private hospital exhibiting an eerie lack of emotional response to his parents' deaths.  The hospital is later attacked by one of the mechanical beings that destroyed Omega's home world, and Omega himself appears to defend James-Michael.  The superhero and the android fight but the conflict ends when James-Michael himself destroys the alien mechanism with energy bursts from his hands (an effect used by Omega in James-Michael's dreams).\n\nAfter this beginning, the story follows James-Michael's life as he is fostered to two young women in the [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan|Hell's Kitchen]] neighborhood of New York City.  The series explores the problems he encounters in a strange new place, and his trials and friendships in a New York City public school. Issues of racism and bullying are addressed, although the stories' focus is on how the reserved and detached James-Michael relates to the world around him.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2006/08/05/trapped-in-a-%20friday-he-never-made/|title=Trapped In A Friday He Never Made! |access-date= December 23, 2006|last=Hatcher|first=Greg|website= Comic Book Resources|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110719014745/http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2006/08/05/trapped-in-a-%20friday-he-never-made/|archive-date=July 19, 2011|url-status= dead|df=mdy-all|date= August 5, 2006}}</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, Omega the Unknown becomes a superhero figure in New York City, tending to fight only second-string supervillains (though he did once confront the [[Hulk]])<ref name=\"Omega2\">{{cite comic| writer= Gerber, Steve; [[Mary Skrenes|Skrenes, Mary]]|penciller= [[Jim Mooney|Mooney, Jim]]|inker= Mooney, Jim|story= Welcome to Hell's Kitchen!|title= Omega the Unknown|issue= #2|date= May 1976}}</ref> with a variety of outcomes. Otherwise, Omega tends to appear when James-Michael is in danger and then takes a more proactive role.  As the series progresses Omega and James-Michael eventually meet and interact, although the nature of their relationship remains unclear. Omega himself is killed in the 10th and final issue, leaving the mysteries of the story unresolved.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nOmega the Unknown is a humanoid being of superhuman power bio-engineered by an extraterrestrial mechanoid race named the Protar, from the planet Protaris in the Regreb System in the Milky Way Galaxy.  The Protar, foreseeing their own extinction, decided to create an ideal race of true humanoids as their legacy to the cosmos.  Their penultimate model, later called Omega, was placed on the planet Srenesk (an anagram of series co-writer [Mary] \"Skrenes\") to learn. He commandeered a Protar starship and fled to Earth after inadvertently destroying the world on which he was placed.  The Earth was the home of the final \"model\" in his series, the artificially created boy James-Michael Starling, whom Omega sought to protect from the Protar.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Gerber, Steve; Skrenes, Mary|penciller= Mooney, Jim|inker= Mooney, Jim|story= Omega the Unknown|title= Omega the Unknown|issue= #1|date= March 1976}}</ref>\n\nWhile on Earth, Omega was employed for odd jobs by a New York City pawn-broker, and had a number of battles with local beings.

In that dimension James battled the demonic entity, [[List of Marvel Comics characters: C#Chthon|Chthon]], before being returned to earth by the [[Scarlet Witch]]. Afterward he is seen to have taken on the costume and title of Omega, and was living in rural Pennsylvania where his \"mother\", a floating robotic head, vowed to take care of him.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Darkhold Omega #1|publisher=Marvel Comics|year=2022}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= https://screenrant.com/marvel-hero-returns-omega-unknown-darkhold/|title= Marvel's Darkhold Event Reveals Surprise Return of a Long Lost Hero|first= Liam|last= McGuire|year= 2022|website= [[Screenrant]]}}</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nOmega was created through Protarian technology, and has superhuman strength. He has limited psychokinetic abilities, and has a psionic rapport with other Protarian organic creations.\n\nOmega was educated as a warrior on the planet Srenesk, trained in the fighting skills of a Srenesk warrior. The extraterrestrial Sreneskian endowed him with the ability to draw upon the psionic energy of the biosphere to project energy bolts from his hands and fly. Using biospheric energy beyond a certain level could result in global destruction.\n\n==Reception==\nIn 2010, [[Comics Bulletin]] ranked Gerber and Mooney's run on ''Omega the Unknown'' tenth on its list of the \"Top 10 1970s Marvels\".<ref>{{cite web |url= http://comicsbulletin.com/top-10-1970s-marvels/|title= Top 10 1970s Marvels|first= Jason|last= Sacks|date= September 6, 2010|website= [[Comics Bulletin]]|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130801070005/http://www.comicsbulletin.com/columns/447/top-10-1970s-marvels|archive-date= August 1, 2013|url-status= live|df=mdy-all|access-date= August 3, 2013}}</ref>\n\n[[Comic Book Resources]] placed Omega the Unknown as one of \"15 Superheroes Marvel Wants You To Forget\", stating \"his complicated history makes it exceedingly unlikely that he'll return to the Marvel universe.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbr.com/superheroes-marvel-wants-you-to-forget/|title= 15 Superheroes Marvel Wants You To Forget|first= Gary|last= Smith|date= August 20, 2017|website= Comic Book Resources|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170902093045/http://www.cbr.com/superheroes-marvel-wants-you-to-forget/|archive-date= September 2, 2017|url-status= live|df= mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n==2007 series==\n[[Image:OMEG001cover 400.jpg|185px|thumb|right|Cover of the first issue of the revamped ''Omega the Unknown'', illustrated by [[Farel Dalrymple]].]]\nNovelist [[Jonathan Lethem]] and artist [[Farel Dalrymple]] revived Omega the Unknown in a 10-issue [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] published in 2007.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Winters |first=Rebecca |url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1056261,00.html|title= First Look: Meta-Hero Worship|magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date= May 1, 2005|location= New York, New York|access-date= December 23, 2006|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110523075008/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1056261,00.html|archive-date=May 23, 2011|url-status= dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Lethem was a childhood fan of the first ''Omega'' series, and referenced the character in his 2003 novel ''[[The Fortress of Solitude (novel)|The Fortress of Solitude]]''.<ref name= \"comr\">{{cite web |last=Renaud |first=Jeffrey |url= http://www.comicbookresources.com/news/newsitem.cgi?id=11990|title=Jonathan Lethem Enters the Unknown with 'Omega' |website=Comic Book Resources|date= September 28, 2007|access-date= November 5, 2007|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20071011010402/http://comicbookresources.com/news/newsitem.cgi?id=11990|archive-date=October 11, 2007|url-status= live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>  When asked about Omega's appeal, Lethem stated,\n\n{{quote|When Marvel invited me into their vault of iconography, I simply leapt at the icon that resonated most deeply with me.
