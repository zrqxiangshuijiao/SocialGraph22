Originally co-created by writer [[Whitney Ellsworth]] and artist [[George Papp]], he was later transformed into Congorilla by [[Robert Bernstein (comics)|Robert Bernstein]] and Howard Sherman. The character first appeared in ''[[More Fun Comics]]'' #56 (June 1940).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cowsill |first1=Alan |last2=Irvine |first2=Alex |last3=Korte |first3=Steve |last4=Manning |first4=Matt |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |last6=Wilson |first6=Sven |title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia: The Definitive Guide to the Characters of the DC Universe |date=2016 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-5357-0 |page=343}}</ref>\n\n==Publication history==\n''Congo Bill'' was a long-running DC Comics adventure [[comic strip]], often reminiscent of [[Alex Raymond]]'s ''[[Jungle Jim]]'' [[newspaper]] strip. Originating in ''More Fun Comics'' #56, the strip was a moderate success and ran there until issue #67 (May 1941), after which it moved to ''[[Action Comics]]'' from issue #37 (June 1941).\n\n''Action Comics'' #191 (April 1954) saw the introduction of [[Janu the Jungle Boy]], a young boy brought up in the jungle after his father had been killed by a tiger. In 1954, DC awarded Congo Bill his own title, published on a bi-monthly schedule, which lasted for seven issues (August/September 1954 \u2013 August/September 1955).\n\nCongo Bill encountered the legendary golden gorilla in ''[[Action Comics]]'' #224 (January 1957).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Rovin |first1=Jeff |title=The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Cartoon Animals |date=1991 |publisher=Prentice Hall Press |isbn=0-13-275561-0 |access-date=8 April 2020 |url=https://archive.org/details/illustratedencyc00rovi/page/54/mode/2up/ |page=54}}</ref> He also encountered the similarly named '''Kongorilla''' in ''[[Action Comics]]'' #228 (May 1957). In issue #248 (January 1959), Congo Bill was transformed into Congorilla<ref>{{cite book |last1=Schelly |first1=William |title=American Comic Book Chronicles: The 1950s |date=2013 |publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing |isbn=9781605490540 |page=215}}</ref> and the title of the strip was likewise changed. The ''Congorilla'' series ran in ''Action Comics'' until issue #261 (February 1960), after which it was transferred to ''[[Adventure Comics]]'' from issues #270 (March 1960) to #283 (April 1961).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Mitchell |first1=Kurt |last2=Thomas |first2=Roy |title=American Comic Book Chronicles: 1940-1944 |date=2019 |publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing |isbn=978-1605490892 |page=26}}</ref>\n\nSince the demise of its own series, Congorilla has mainly been seen as a guest star in other titles, including as part of the [[Forgotten Heroes]]. The character finally received a [[Limited series (comics)|mini-series]] of his own in [[1992 in comics|1992]], where Congo Bill is betrayed by his (now corrupt) ward Janu, who usurps the Congorilla identity and Bill is forced to fight his adopted son to the death. Congo Bill became blind in his left eye, making it hard for him to see after fighting his son to the end. In [[1999 in comics|1999]], DC Comics once again brought Congo Bill back for another four-issue [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] under the company's mature readership Vertigo Comics imprint.\n\nCongorilla returned in the 2009 series ''[[Cry for Justice]]'', joining a proactive splinter faction of the [[Justice League]]. Following that series, Congorilla became a main character in ''Justice League of America'' as a full-time member of the Justice League.<ref name=regrettable>{{cite book |last1=Morris |first1=Jon |title=The League of Regrettable Superheroes: Half Baked Heroes from Comic Book History |date=2015 |publisher=Quirk Books |location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania |isbn=978-1-59474-763-2 |pages=142\u2013143}}</ref> He also starred in the ''Starman/Congorilla'' one-shot (March 2011) alongside close friend and teammate [[Starman (Mikaal Tomas)]].\n\nCongo Bill next appeared in the Rebirth continuity as the warden of Monster Rock, where he trained the hero [[Damage (DC comics)#Ethan Avery|Damage]] on how to control the giant monster one turns into.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nWilliam \"Congo Bill\" Glenmorgan<ref>''Justice League of America'' (vol. 2) #47 (September 2010)</ref> was born in 1898, the son of a Scottish gamekeeper. At one point he was a member of the [[Irish Republican Army|IRA]],<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=25567 | title=WC10: Spotlight on James Robinson | last=Evans | first=Chris | work=[[Comic Book Resources]] | date=April 5, 2010 | access-date=June 17, 2010}}</ref> and during [[World War I]] he served as soldier in the [[Battle of the Somme]] in France 1916 and also Battle of Flanders Field in Passendale, Belgium. He worked his way up a spy in [[Austria]].<ref>''Justice League of America'' (vol. 2) #44 (June 2010)</ref> He later became a globe-trotting adventurer, and for a time worked for the Worldwide Insurance Company, protecting policies they had written and saving the company from fraudulent payouts.\n\nBill grew content to live in his adopted [[Africa]]n home, swearing to protect it from harm. There he befriended a witch-doctor known as Chief Kawolo. When Kawolo was mortally injured in a fall, he summoned Bill to his bedside, and offered him a magic ring. Kawolo told the skeptical Congo Bill that, by rubbing the ring, he could transfer his consciousness into the body of the legendary Golden Gorilla. He accepted the ring to humor his friend's dying wish. Several weeks later, an earthquake trapped Bill in a deep cave. With no possible escape, Congo Bill hopelessly rubbed the magic ring. Instantly, his mind was transported into the body of the Golden Gorilla.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Markstein |first1=Don |title=Congorilla |url=http://www.toonopedia.com/congoril.htm |website=Don Markstein's Toonopedia |access-date=2 April 2020 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120917144634/http://www.toonopedia.com/congoril.htm |archive-date=17 September 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Racing to the cave-in, he used his massive strength to clear the blocked entrance and wondering what had become of his body without him being \"home\".

As Congorilla, Bill's simian body grants him super-gorilla strength, endurance, agility, durability, and senses, a regenerative healing process, and the ability to increase his height to tremendous levels.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Congorilla_(Prime_Earth)|title = Congorilla (Prime Earth)}}</ref> To become Congorilla, Bill had to rub the magic ring he wore, which would swap his consciousness with that of the Golden Gorilla.\n\n==Other versions==\nIn the [[Elseworlds]] story ''[[JLA: The Nail]]'', Congo Bill (in his Congorilla form) makes an appearance in [[Professor Hamilton]]'s [[Cadmus Labs]].<ref>[[Davis, Alan]] (w, p), Farmer, Mark (i).

Now a crime boss in the superhero ghetto that hosts most of the retired or aged [[Golden Age]] crime fighters, Congorilla has remained in the body of the Golden Gorilla for decades, since his aging human body became too fragile. However, the body of Congo Bill refuses to die, is still inhabited by the spirit of the Golden Gorilla, and is now hidden away in Congorilla's apartment.\n\n==In other media==\n===Television===\nA variation of William Glenmorgan appears in the ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'' episode \"My Name Is Emiko Queen\", portrayed by Edward Foy.
