Created by [[Steven T. Seagle]] and [[Duncan Rouleau]], Baymax first appeared in ''Sunfire & Big Hero 6'' #1 (September [[1998 in comics|1998]]). Baymax begins his existence as [[Hiro Takachiho]]'s science project. Originally designed to be a hydro-powered robotic synthformer programmed to serve as Hiro's personal bodyguard, butler and chauffeur, Baymax becomes Hiro's best friend and father figure when the young inventor programs his recently deceased father's brain engrams into Baymax's artificial intelligence. When the Giri recruits Hiro into the fledgling super-team [[Big Hero 6 (comics)|Big Hero 6]], Baymax also joins the team, where his phenomenal strength, amazing surveillance and data analysis capabilities have proven useful.\n\nBaymax is an artificial synthformer capable of synthtransing his body into various forms: a large humanoid male, \"Battle-Dragon\" and \"Action-Mecha\". The first serves as his default form, designed to be less conspicuous in public while attending to Hiro's daily needs. His other forms, significantly more powerful and imposing, are primarily used during undercover missions and other hostile operations. In all forms, Baymax has internal scanners and sensors able to detect and evaluate threats posed by nearby lifeforms. He is also programmed with fighting techniques from forms of combat including [[karate]], [[tae kwon do]], [[Western boxing]] and [[Wing Chun]].\n\nBaymax appears in the 2014 [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney animated]] film ''[[Big Hero 6 (film)|Big Hero 6]]'' and its extended media, voiced by [[Scott Adsit]]. He is depicted as an inflatable robot built by Tadashi, the older brother of the protagonist Hiro Hamada, to serve as a healthcare companion. When he is with Big Hero 6, Baymax wears armor that has wings allowing him to fly, while his fists can detach like rocket punches. The armor also has magnets attached to his back for Hiro to stick on while flying. Baymax appeared in the sequel [[Big Hero 6: The Series|television series]], which continued the story of the film which aired from 2017 to 2021 on [[Disney Channel]] and [[Disney XD]]. Baymax appeared in the spin-off series ''[[Baymax!]]'', it premiered on June 29, 2022 on [[Disney+]].\n\n==Publication history==\nCreated by [[Steven T. Seagle]] and [[Duncan Rouleau]] in their spare time while working on another project, Baymax was first intended to appear with the rest of [[Big Hero 6 (comics)|Big Hero 6]] in ''[[Alpha Flight (comic book)|Alpha Flight]]'' #17 (December 1998). However, the team first appeared in their own self-titled three-issue miniseries by writer [[Scott Lobdell]] and artist Gus Vasquez, which due to scheduling issues, was published before ''Alpha Flight'' #17.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.laughingplace.com/w/blogs/fanboy/2014/03/25/movie-week-a-look-ahead-to-big-hero-6/|title=LaughingPlace.com \u00bb Movie Week: A Look Ahead To Big Hero 6|date=26 March 2014 |access-date=23 October 2014}}</ref><ref>Palmeri, Christopher (November 3, 2014).

''[[The Vancouver Sun]]''.</ref> The character appeared with the team in a subsequent five-issue miniseries which was launched by Marvel Comics in September 2008.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nMonster Baymax began his existence as a science project created by [[Hiro Takachiho|Hiro]]. He was originally designed to be a hydro-powered robotic synthformer programmed to serve as Hiro's personal bodyguard, butler, and chauffeur. However, prior to the project's completion, Hiro's father died and the young inventor programmed Baymax's artificial intelligence using the brain engrams of his recently departed father. With the thoughts and emotions of Hiro's father, Baymax became much more than a robotic bodyguard. He also functions as Hiro's best friend and father figure, and is by his side nearly every hour of every day. Baymax also feels a deep attachment to Hiro's mother; however, Hiro and Baymax decided it was not in her best interest to inform her that her departed husband's memories were used as the basis for Baymax's artificial intelligence, at least for the time being.<ref name=\"Hero #1\">''Big Hero 6'' #1 (2008)</ref>\n\nBaymax is programmed to serve and protect Hiro and therefore unable to allow his creator to be placed in possibly dangerous situations. When the Giri attempted to recruit Hiro into the fledgling super-team known as [[Big Hero 6 (comics)|Big Hero 6]], Baymax was also on their list of potential operatives. Baymax opposed the idea of Hiro being placed in harm's way but acquiesced to joining the team after the Everwraith, the astral embodiment of those killed in the 1945 nuclear attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, abducted Hiro's mother. Baymax continues to serve alongside Hiro on Big Hero 6, where his phenomenal strength, and amazing surveillance and data analysis capabilities have proven very useful.<ref name=\"Hero #1\"/>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nBaymax is an artificial synthformer capable of synthtransing his body into various forms. His default form is a large humanoid male designed to be less conspicuous in public while attending to Hiro's daily needs. His other forms \"Battle-Dragon\" and \"Action-Mecha\", are significantly more powerful and imposing than his default humanoid form, and are primarily used during undercover missions and other hostile operations. When Baymax sustains physical injuries beyond his damage threshold, he automatically reverts to his humanoid form and becomes temporarily depowered.<ref name=\"Hero #1\"/>\n\nIn all forms, Baymax is equipped with internal scanners and sensors able to detect and evaluate the threat posed by lifeforms in the immediate vicinity. He can also deploy remote monitors to record events from afar. His feet are equipped with jet engines capable of generating a thrust sufficient to propel him at speeds up to Mach 4. He can send, receive, and intercept radio transmissions, and monitors all networks maintained by the Japanese Ministry of Defense. Baymax is also directly linked to Hiro's personal Core Cyber-Network (CCN). As a result, when Baymax is not in Hiro's vicinity, he can be immediately summoned via a communication device mounted on Hiro's wrist. Baymax is also connected to Hiro's cybernetic glasses, so that everything that Hiro sees and hears while wearing the glasses is stored in Baymax's databanks for later reference and analysis.<ref name=\"Hero #1\"/>\n\nBaymax is programmed with fighting techniques from several forms of combat, including karate, tae kwon do, Western boxing, and Wing Chun. He possesses a durable, polymantium endo/exoskeleton resistant to most forms of small ballistics. Baymax uses water as his primary source of power for locomotion. His artificial intelligence system is memory-card-based and contains thoughts and emotions of Hiro's departed father, industrialist Tomeo Takachiho.<ref name=\"Hero #1\"/>\n\n==In other media==\n\n===Film===\n{{Infobox character\n| series             = [[Big Hero 6 (film)|Big Hero 6]]\n| name               = Baymax\n| image              = Baymax from Disney's Big Hero 6.png\n| image_size         = \n| caption            = [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]] re-imagining of Baymax\n| first              = ''[[Big Hero 6 (film)|Big Hero 6]]'' (2014)\n| last               = \n| voice              = [[Scott Adsit]]\n| gender             = Male ([[masculine]] [[pronoun]]s)\n| species = Robot\n| nickname           = The Red Panda <small>(by Karmi)</small><ref>{{cite episode|title=Fan Friction|series=Big Hero 6: The Series|credits=Juwono, Ben (director); Jenny Jaffe (writer)|network=[[Disney XD]]|airdate=August 18, 2018|season=1|number=15}}</ref><br>Hugs <small>(by Trina)</small>\n| color              = #AE181D\n}}\n\nIn ''[[Big Hero 6 (film)|Big Hero 6]]'', Baymax is voiced by [[Scott Adsit]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Disney Gives Marvel Fans First Look at Big Hero 6 Animated Film|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2013/08/10/disney-gives-marvel-fans-first-look-at-big-hero-6-animated-film|access-date=9 August 2013|newspaper=[[IGN]]|date=9 August 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"USATodayTruitt\" >{{cite web|last=Truitt|first=Brian|title=Meet the saviors of San Fransokyo in 'Big Hero 6'|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2014/07/13/big-hero-6-character-reveal-exclusive/12535005/|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|access-date=July 14, 2014|date=July 13, 2014}}</ref> In the film, he is depicted as an inflatable robot with a [[carbon fibers|carbon fiber]] skeleton built by Hiro Hamada's older brother Tadashi to serve as a personal [[healthcare provider]] companion.

Due to being a personal \"healthcare companion\" Baymax is calm and nurturing, thanks to the chip engineered by Tadashi, which contains \"10,000 different medical procedures\". Up to 4 chips can work in conjunction to empower him and shape his attributes. Hiro later designs a combat chip that instructs him on numerous forms of martial arts, so Baymax is not left defenseless if the need arises. It is shown that if Baymax is left alone with this, he becomes a lethal force. To coat his fragile and inflatable body, Baymax wears bright red armor with purple accents. The suit has wings and boosters for flight, as well as detachable rocket fists for combat and utility. Baymax's armor also has small magnets attached to his back that allow Hiro to stick to him in flight. At the end of the movie, Baymax remains behind in the portal, sacrificing himself to save Hiro and embedding his healthcare chip in a rocket fist. Hiro would later recover it and rebuilt Baymax, allowing them to reunite.\n\n===Television===\nBaymax appears in ''[[Big Hero 6: The Series]]'' with Adsit reprising the role.<ref>{{cite news|title='Big Hero 6': Maya Rudolph & More Reprise Roles for Disney XD Animated Series|url=https://deadline.com/2016/11/big-hero-6-maya-rudolph-jamie-chung-reprise-roles-disney-xd-animated-series-1201847587/|work=Deadline|access-date=November 3, 2016|date=November 3, 2016}}</ref> The first episode, \"Baymax Returns\" takes place during the last part of the movie where Hiro rebuilds Baymax.
