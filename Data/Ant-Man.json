Created by [[Stan Lee]], [[Larry Lieber]] and [[Jack Kirby]], Ant-Man's first appearance was in ''[[Tales to Astonish]]'' #27 (January 1962) but first appeared in costume in ''[[Tales to Astonish]]'' #35 (September 1962). The persona was originally the brilliant scientist [[Hank Pym]]'s superhero alias after inventing a substance that can change size, but reformed thieves [[Ant-Man (Scott Lang)|Scott Lang]] and [[Eric O'Grady]] also took on the mantle after the original changed his superhero identity to various other aliases, such as [[Giant-Man]], [[Goliath (Marvel Comics)|Goliath]], and [[Yellowjacket (Marvel Comics)|Yellowjacket]]. Pym's Ant-Man is also a founding member of the super hero team known as the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]. The character has appeared in several films based on the Marvel character, such as ''[[Ant-Man (film)|Ant-Man]]'' (2015), ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'' (2016), ''[[Ant-Man and the Wasp]]'' (2018), ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'' (2019) and upcoming ''[[Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania]]''.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nOver the years a number of different characters have assumed the title of Ant-Man, most of whom have been connected with the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].\n\n===Hank Pym===\n{{main|Hank Pym}}\nThe original Ant-Man was Biophysicist and Security Operations Center expert Dr. Henry \"Hank\" Pym; who decided to become a superhero after the death of his first wife [[Maria Pym|Maria Trovaya]] who had been a political dissident in Hungary. Falling in love with him and believing that his American citizenship would protect her, Maria traveled with Hank to Hungary shortly after their marriage to start their new life together. Unfortunately they were confronted by corrupt agents of the secret police. Hank was knocked unconscious and Maria was murdered. Pym was greatly distraught by his wife's death, and decided to do whatever he could in the future to battle injustice. After discovering a chemical substance, which he called Pym Particles, that would allow the user to alter his size, he armed himself with a helmet that could control ants. After that, Pym would shrink down to the size of an insect to become the mystery-solving Ant-Man, solving crimes and stopping criminals.<ref name=\"IGN Hank Bio\">{{cite web | url = http://stars.ign.com/objects/924/924202_biography.html | title = Henry Pym Biography | access-date = April 18, 2011 | work = IGN | archive-url = https://archive.today/20130126003441/http://stars.ign.com/objects/924/924202_biography.html | archive-date = January 26, 2013 | url-status = dead | df = mdy-all }}</ref> He soon shared his discovery with his new girlfriend [[Wasp (character)|Janet van Dyne]], who became his crime-fighting partner Wasp, when he helped her avenge the death of her scientist father Vernon van Dyne who was killed by an alien unleashed by one of Vernon's own experiments.<ref name='invasionillumination'>{{cite web | url = http://marvel.com/news/story/3725/secret_invasion_illumination_hank_pym | archive-url = https://archive.today/20130128062751/http://marvel.com/news/story/3725/secret_invasion_illumination_hank_pym | url-status = dead | archive-date = January 28, 2013 | title = Secret Invasion Illumination | access-date = April 18, 2011 | date = May 30, 2008 | work = Marvel.com }}</ref> The duo would become founding members of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], fighting recurring enemies such as the mad scientist [[Egghead (Marvel Comics)|Egghead]], the mutant [[Whirlwind (comics)|Whirlwind]], and Pym's own robotic creation [[Ultron]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://marvel.com/news/story/6469/psych_ward_hank_pym | title = Psych Ward: Hank Pym | access-date = April 18, 2011 | date = December 29, 2008 | work = Marvel.com | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110423110120/http://marvel.com/news/story/6469/psych_ward_hank_pym | archive-date = April 23, 2011 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}</ref> While Pym is the original Ant-Man, he has adopted other aliases over the years including [[Giant-Man]], [[Goliath (Marvel Comics)|Goliath]], [[Yellowjacket (Marvel Comics)|Yellowjacket]],<ref name='invasionillumination'/> and Wasp after Janet's presumed death in ''[[Secret Invasion]]''.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://marvel.com/news/story/9634/mighty_avengers_assemble | title = Mighty Avengers: Assemble | access-date = April 18, 2011 | date = October 7, 2009 | work = Marvel.com | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20121021052035/http://marvel.com/news/story/9634/mighty_avengers_assemble | archive-date = October 21, 2012 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}</ref> Leaving his original persona vacant, his successors have taken up the Ant-Man role while Pym explored these other identities.\n\n===Scott Lang===\n{{main|Ant-Man (Scott Lang)}}\nScott Lang was a thief who became Ant-Man after stealing the Ant-Man suit to save his daughter [[Cassandra Lang|Cassandra \"Cassie\" Lang]] from a heart condition.<ref name=\"friday 13\"/> Reforming from his life of crime, Lang soon took on a full-time career as Ant-Man with the encouragement of Hank Pym.<ref name=\"IGN Lang\">{{cite web | url = http://stars.ign.com/objects/924/924272_biography.html | title = Ant Man (Scott Lang) Biography | access-date = April 18, 2011 | work = IGN | archive-url = https://archive.today/20130125235232/http://stars.ign.com/objects/924/924272_biography.html | archive-date = January 25, 2013 | url-status = dead | df = mdy-all }}</ref> He became an affiliate of the [[Fantastic Four]],<ref name=\"take 10\">{{cite web | url = http://marvel.com/news/story/13757/take_10_replacement_ff_members | title = Take 10: Replacement FF Members | access-date = April 18, 2011 | date = August 25, 2010 | work = Marvel.com | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110412060544/http://marvel.com/news/story/13757/take_10_replacement_ff_members | archive-date = April 12, 2011 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}</ref> and later became a full-time member of the Avengers.
