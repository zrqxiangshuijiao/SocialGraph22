Created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Jack Kirby]], the character first appeared in ''[[Fantastic Four (comic book)|Fantastic Four]]'' #30 (September 1964).<ref>{{cite book |last1=DeFalco |first1=Tom |last2=Sanderson |first2=Peter |last3=Brevoort |first3=Tom |last4=Teitelbaum |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |last6=Darling |first6=Andrew |last7=Forbeck |first7=Matt |last8=Cowsill |first8=Alan |last9=Bray |first9=Adam |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-7890-0 |page=109}}</ref>\n\n==Publication history==\n{{Expand section|date=December 2012}}\nDiablo was created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Jack Kirby]], and first appeared in ''[[Fantastic Four (comic book)|Fantastic Four]]'' #30 (September 1964).<ref>{{cite book |last =Rovin |first =Jeff |title =The Encyclopedia of Supervillains |publisher =Facts on File |date =1987 |location =New York |isbn = 0-8160-1356-X |pages=82\u201383}}</ref>\n\nIn a 2013 interview with [[Chris Hardwick]] of [[The Nerdist Podcast|Nerdist]], creator Lee said that Diablo was his greatest regret because he could not remember the character aside from his name, who he is, and why he did what he did, saying, \"When you create a character you should feel you know him\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nerdist.com/2013/09/nerdist-podcast-stan-lee |title= Episode 413: Nerdist Podcast: Stan Lee Returns |work=[[The Nerdist Podcast]]|date=September 27, 2013|last=Hardwick |first=Chris|author-link=Hardwick, Chris}}</ref>\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nEsteban Coraz\u00f3n de Ablo was a powerful alchemist in 9th century [[Zaragoza|Saragossa]], who sold his soul to the demon [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]] to lengthen his life far beyond a human span.<ref>''Fantastic Force'' #18</ref>\n\nYears later, Diablo set up a base in [[Transylvania]] where he made a pact with the [[Vampire (Marvel Comics)|Vampires]].<ref>''Fantastic Four'' vol. 3 #36</ref>\n\nThe villagers had enough of him where they formed an angry mob and buried him within a stone crypt under his castle. Another century later, the Fantastic Four appeared in Transylvania on a vacation, when a local named Baron Hugo told them the legend of Diablo. That night, Diablo whispered to The [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] to awake and free him from his prison by pulling out the stone plug on his crypt and smashing the stone slab that covered him. Freed, Diablo offered a potion to the Thing that would turn him halfway into a human. In exchange for Ben's services for a year, he would give him the other potion that would finalize the change. When the rest of the Fantastic Four arrived, they found Ben working for Diablo. They fought with him and tried to convince him to leave his service, but Ben refused, and the three were forced to leave him behind. Diablo soon made his appearance known to the world, and sold his alchemic chemicals internationally, making him the richest man on the planet. Shortly before the rest of the world, [[Mister Fantastic]] discovered that Diablo's chemicals worked, but only for a short while, before failing. The world turned on Diablo, but he had already built up an army of loyal followers and was prepared to use his alchemic powers to conquer the planet. But once Diablo had revealed his true intentions, the Fantastic Four were free to attack him. At the same time, the Thing had also discovered that the potion he was given wore off, and he turned on Diablo, but Diablo used one of his chemical pellets to knock him out and seal him in an unbreakable, glass capsule. The remaining three members of the Fantastic Four soon attacked Diablo's fortress, but after a struggle, Diablo managed to capture them with his chemical pellets. Diablo sealed up the last of the Fantastic Four in the same capsules, but Ben quickly escaped when his broke down. Angered, he chased Diablo through his own castle, until he crushed a suit of armor into a giant ball, and threw it after him. Diablo ran from it, hiding within the crypt that the villagers had sealed him in. The Thing followed behind him and reinserted the giant, stone plug, and then smashed it with both fists, causing the entire castle to come crumbling down upon the crypt. The Fantastic Four were later freed, and the Human Torch melted the stone into slag to harden Diablo's prison.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #30</ref>\n\nBut Diablo eventually used his potions to destroy his melted stone prison, and escape to get revenge on the Fantastic Four. His next move was to travel to North America and New York's State University, where he helped Professor Gilbert to animate his android creation, [[Dragon Man (comics)|Dragon Man]]. He turned the Dragon Man against the Fantastic Four, but it eventually turned on him and drove both of them underneath a frozen lake, where he was lost for a time.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #35</ref> Diablo later reactivated the Dragon Man, creating a whole army of Dragon Men. He was defeated by the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], however.<ref>''The Avengers'' #41-42</ref>\n\nDiablo later clashed with [[Doctor Doom]].<ref>''Marvel Super-Heroes'' #20</ref> He next took the [[Inhumans|Inhuman]], [[Crystal (comics)|Crystal]], captive.

He was later responsible for the destruction of the Fantastic Four's headquarters, Pier 4. He aided the Fantastic Four in driving the chaos demon [[Shuma-Gorath]] back to its home dimension.<ref>''Marvel Knights 4'' 25-27 (Feb. - April 2006).

Thanks to his tutors, he was educated and is self-taught in these arcane arts. His youth and vitality have been lengthened, due to a longevity serum. He can affect his own body by changing the appearance to look like a different person or become \"nerveless protoplasm\", which protects him from certain forms of harm.\n\nDiablo employs a huge arsenal of alchemical weapons that he discovered or invented, and conceals within hidden pouches and pockets in his costume. But unknown to science, his concoctions are almost [[Magic (supernatural)|magical]] in nature. Although the range of his power is wide, these effects are temporary unless Diablo provides a second dose, with the exception of an [[elixir]] he used on Dragon Man.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' Vol. 1 #35 (February 1965)</ref> His mixtures include nerve gas pellets, freezing potions, and pills that make people susceptible to Diablo's [[Hypnosis|hypnotic]] orders. He can also transmute non-organic matter (stones to feathers, water to ice, etc.), unleash explosive blasts, model surface features, give life to inanimate objects, and create beings formed from the elements of earth, fire, wind, and water called \"elementals\".<ref>''Fantastic Four'' Vol. 1 #232 (July 1981)</ref> Other concoctions utillize teleportation for quick escapes.\n\n==Other versions==\n\n===Age of Apocalypse===\nIn the ''[[Age of Apocalypse]]'' reality, Diablo and the [[Absorbing Man]] work as prison wardens for one of the many prisons maintained for [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]]. This particular one is located in a section of Aztec ruins in Mexico. He is killed by [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] during X-Men's mission to rescue [[Robert Kelly (comics)|Robert Kelly]], a mutant-human peace activist.<ref>''Tales of the Age of Apocalypse'' #1</ref>\n\n===Marvel Zombies===\nIn the ''[[Marvel Zombies]]'' reality, Diablo appears as one of the many zombiefied super-powered beings hoping for access to the Kingpin's human cloning vats. He successfully trades several cans of cat food for his desired time. He then made friends with zombie Scorpion. Zombie Diablo then kills himself by ripping out the skull and severely crushed it after one of his arms are ripped apart.<ref>''Marvel Zombies 3'' #2</ref>\n\n===Ultimate Marvel===\nThe [[Ultimate Universe]] version of Diablo is named '''Menendez Flores''' instead of Esteban Coraz\u00f3n de Ablo. He made his Ultimate Universe debut in ''[[Ultimate Fantastic Four]]'' #39. In that issue, it was revealed that he was an evil alchemist who had been confined by the good alchemist Andrea Vecchiato to a \"tower with no door\" in 15th century Milan. Along with the help of his hunchback henchman Peppone, he reached across time to kidnap people close to the Fantastic Four, only to challenge them to a contest. He intended to use Reed's sister as an important part of his plan for immortality. The Four, along with a contingent of soldiers led by [[Willie Lumpkin]], head back in time to oppose him. He was defeated and vanishes after being touched by Reed's temporarily super-powered sister Enid.<ref>''Ultimate Fantastic Four'' #39</ref>\n\n==In other media==\n\n===Television===\n* Diablo appeared in the 1967 ''[[Fantastic Four (1967 TV series)|Fantastic Four]]'' episode \"Diablo\", voiced by [[Regis Cordic]].<ref>{{Cite episode |title = Diablo |series = Fantastic Four |series-link = Fantastic Four (1967 TV series) }}</ref>\n* Diablo appeared in the ''[[Fantastic Four: World's Greatest Heroes]]'' episode \"Johnny Storm and the Potion of Fire\" voiced by [[Trevor Devall]].<ref>{{Cite episode |title = Johnny Storm And The Potion Of Fire |series = Fantastic Four: World's Greatest Heroes |series-link = Fantastic Four: World's Greatest Heroes }}</ref> He performs a ceremony to attain the vast power of the elements through special potions to rule the world. However, the ceremony is disrupted by [[Human Torch|Johnny Storm]], who crashes into the fire potion, which affects his own fire powers and mind. Diablo secretly makes the element of fire grow inside of him using his alchemical potions. Even in spite of Johnny overcomes its power, Diablo steals the fire potion back and completes the original ceremony before [[Mister Fantastic]] uses a magic neutralizer he built to stop him once and for all.\n*Diablo appeared in the [[anime]] series ''[[Marvel Disk Wars: The Avengers]]'', voiced by Tomohisa Aso in Japanese and [[Matthew Mercer]] in English.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/tv-shows/Marvel-Disk-Wars-The-Avengers/Diablo/|title=Diablo|website=Behind The Voice Actors}}</ref>\n\n===Video games===\n* Diablo appears in the 2005 ''[[Fantastic Four (video game)|Fantastic Four]]'' video game, voiced by [[Andr\u00e9 Sogliuzzo]].{{citation needed|date=October 2020}} He and his army of jungle warriors seek to find cosmic-powered meteors that landed on Earth following the cosmic storm that gave the Fantastic Four their powers to rule all of mankind, putting him in conflict with the team as they seek the rocks to power a machine that could turn the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] back to normal.\n* Diablo appears in the mobile game ''[[Marvel Contest of Champions]]''.{{citation needed|date=October 2020}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://marvel.com/universe/Diablo_%28Esteban_De_Ablo%29 Diablo] at Marvel.com\n* [https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Esteban_Coraz\u00f3n_de_Ablo_(Earth-616) Diablo] at Marvel Database\n* [http://www.marveldirectory.com/individuals/d/diablo.htm Diablo] at Marvel Directory\n* [https://comicvine.gamespot.com/diablo/4005-10242/ Diablo] at Comic Vine\n\n{{Fantastic Four}}\n{{Stan Lee}}\n{{Jack Kirby}}\n\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1964]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Jack Kirby]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Stan Lee]]\n[[Category:Fantastic Four characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional alchemists]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters with immortality]] \n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters who use magic]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics male supervillains]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]"}]}}}}
