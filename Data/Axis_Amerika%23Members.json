The [[Valkyrie]] Gudra actually steals the soul of one of them, the explosive hero known as [[TNT (comics)|TNT]]. It was soon after this that Tsunami defects; she was then replaced with Kamikaze. During an intense battle, Die Fledermaus is slain by [[Fury (DC Comics)|Fury]] while she is affected by the god [[Tisiphone]]. The Axis suffer a major defeat but return. The All-Stars are aided in this second fight by a similar group of heroes known as ''The Allies''. This team consists of Fireball, Kuei, Phantasmo, and the Squire.<ref name=\"dc-ency\"/>\n\nDuring the \"[[Infinite Crisis]]\" storyline, \u00dcbermensch and Sea Wolf appear as members of [[Alexander Luthor Jr.]]'s [[Secret Society of Super Villains]].<ref>''Villains United'' #5. DC Comics.</ref><ref>''Aquaman'' (vol. 6) #37. DC Comics.</ref>\n\n===Modern Age team===\nThis team was an updated version of the old team and was created by Manson and his Clockwatchers organization; they have no relation to the original Axis Amerika. Axis America was a secret [[Neo-fascism|fascist]] cult who ran a children's home called Safe Haven. The JLA arrived to mediate between governmental forces and what they believed to be the innocent men and women inside the camp. Manson manipulated Faith, his former servant, causing her powers to go out of control. It seemed, to the public at large, that the JLA had killed thousands of innocent people.<ref name=\"dc-ency\">{{Citation | last = Beatty | first = Scott | author-link = Scott Beatty | contribution = Axis America | editor-last = Dougall | editor-first = Alastair | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia | pages = 32 | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]] | place = London | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-0-7566-4119-1 | oclc = 213309017}}</ref>\n\nSuperman is imprisoned for the destruction of Safe Haven.
