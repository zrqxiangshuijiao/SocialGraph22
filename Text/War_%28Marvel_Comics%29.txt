Two are discussed here: both members of the [[Horsemen of Apocalypse|Four Horsemen of Apocalypse]]. The first '''War''' (real name unknown) and '''Abraham Kieros'''. The title was also held by the mutant [[Gazer]] and, briefly, by Bruce Banner, the [[Hulk]].\n\n==War (Abraham Kieros)==\n{{Infobox comics character|\nimage=[[Image:Xfactor19 005.jpg|199px]]\n|caption=War, in action.

He was kept in a hospital and placed in an [[Negative pressure ventilator|iron lung]], but felt as though he was betrayed and forgotten by his country. Apocalypse appeared to him one day and offered him the ability to move and to get revenge on those who had tossed him aside.<ref>''X-Factor'' #11</ref> He accepted the offer and was indeed given the ability to move again, which allowed him to use his mutant power\u2014the ability to create explosions through kinetic contact, usually by clapping his hands together\u2014in Apocalypse's service as his Horseman of War. He often bickered with one of the other Horsemen, [[Famine (comics)|Famine]], and disliked her total lack of obedience.\n\nWar liked to take control of situations and during their first confrontation with [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]], attempted to lead the other Horsemen. Famine and Pestilence refused to obey his orders and flew off to do their own business.{{Issue|date=August 2011}} Soon after, [[Archangel (comics)|Death]] took over leadership and the Four Horsemen learned to ride as one.{{Issue|date=August 2011}} During the attack on [[Manhattan]], War immediately attacked [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] and was later teleported back to the ship by Apocalypse, where he fought several more X-Factor members.{{Issue|date=August 2011}} He was eventually defeated by [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]]. Apocalypse then grabbed War and fled.{{Issue|date=August 2011}}\n\nLater, during the [[X-Cutioner's Song]] story arc, War attacked [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] and Iceman, but soon fled after [[Caliban (comics)|Caliban]] grabbed [[Jean Grey]] and Cyclops, handing them over to Apocalypse, who was really [[Mr. Sinister]] in disguise.{{Issue|date=August 2011}} The [[X-Men]] sought out the Horsemen and War was presumably defeated in combat.{{Issue|date=August 2011}}\n\nMuch later, War appeared in an hospital, once again paralyzed from the neck down, apparently abandoned by Apocalypse who stripped him of his powers. Archangel, who had gained newfound powers and had been searching for Kieros, healed him of his wounds, giving him hope to start over with a new life.<ref>''Wolverine'' (vol. 2) #147 (February 2000)</ref>\n\n===Powers and abilities===\nKieros is a mutant with the superhuman power to create explosions in his immediate area by clapping his hands. He does so by harnessing the minor kinetic force created when his hands strike each other, amplifying it to a significant degree, and redirecting it spatially so that it strikes and affects some other object in his line-of-sight, causing an explosive release of force. The limits of the range in which his power is effective have not yet been determined.\n\nWhile a servant of Apocalypse, he used his sentient ship to construct for War a robot mount that resembles a demonic quadruped beast and that can travel on land or fly through the air and also was capable of teleportation.\n\n==War (Apocalypse vs. Dracula)==\n{{Infobox comics character\n|image=\n|caption=Art by Clay Henry.\n|character_name=War\n|real_name=\n|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]\n|debut=''X-Men: Apocalypse vs. Dracula'' #1 (February 2006)\n|creators=[[Frank Tieri (writer)|Frank Tieri]] <BR> [[Clayton Henry]]\n|alliances=The Riders of the Dark<br/>[[Horsemen of Apocalypse|Four Horsemen of Apocalypse]]\n|aliases=\n|powers=Superhumanly strong<br>Wields dual axes which he throws with remarkable accuracy\n}}\n\nThe earliest depiction of [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]]'s Horseman, War. Not much is known about this incarnation of War. He was chosen by Apocalypse in the fifteenth century to become his horseman and lead his army, the Riders of the Dark. This army was so fierce and powerful that most people presumed it was just a myth used to scare soldiers before their first battle. It was no myth at all, and it precisely was what people thought it was, fierce and strong. In most of their battles, the only soldier who had to fight was War, who would single-handedly defeat hordes of men just by himself.\n\nIn 1459, the Riders of the Dark appeared in [[Romania]] where [[Dracula (Marvel Comics)|Vlad \u0162epe\u015f]]' army was fighting against the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] and emerged victorious. Unfortunately for Vlad (whom would become Dracula), War defeated Dracula's army. The survivors fled for their life, abandoning Dracula on the field who stood his ground and faced War but ultimately fell.\n\n==War (Gazer)==\n{{about||the Dungeons and Dragons creature occasionally referred to as \"the Gazer\"|Beholder (Dungeons & Dragons)|the fictional place in the Spawn comic series|Spawn (comics)}}\n{{Infobox comics character\n|image=GazerWar.png\n|caption=Gazer as War, Horseman of Apocalypse.<br />Art by Salvador Larroca.\n|character_name=Gazer\n|real_name=\n|species=[[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|Human Mutant]] and [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|Human Mutate]]|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]\n|debut=''X-Men'' (vol. 2) #169 (June 2005)\n|creators=[[Peter Milligan]] <BR> [[Salvador Larroca]]\n|alliances=[[Horsemen of Apocalypse|Four Horsemen of Apocalypse]]<br/>[[NASA]]\n|aliases=War\n|powers=<br>Superhuman strength and physical resistance,<br>Optic blasts,<br>Ability to absorb radiation\n}}\n'''Gazer''' was a [[mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] astronaut, who after being depowered on [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]], went out into space to die. Instead he was transported onto Apocalypse's ship and made to battle for the title of War, one of the Horsemen of Apocalypse. With [[Ozymandias (Marvel Comics)|Ozymandias]]' intervention, he was victorious, and through a torturous process became the newest incarnation of War.<ref>''X-Men'' (vol. 2) #183</ref>\n\nGazer was an astronaut permanently stationed alone on a [[NASA]] observation space station, due to the unusual metabolism he possessed as his mutant power, whereby he could absorb harmful radiation and process it to gain sustenance. He first encountered the [[X-Men]] when they used his station as a staging post for an attack on a group of non-sentient aliens which induced harmful emotions in humans.{{Issue|date=October 2009}}\n\n[[File:GazerBeforeAfterMDay.png|thumb|left|Gazer, before (left) and after his depowerment on M-Day]]\n\nShortly afterwards, he lost his powers on [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]], along with 90% of mutants. Succumbing to radiation sickness, he began to imagine that an experiment on the effects of radiation sickness was sentient (calling it \"Phantom Torso\"), and it constantly advised him to call NASA to ask for a return home. However, he remained until an alien resembling [[Doop (comics)|Doop]], which he had built up to himself as his last hope, passed by his station on its way to crash-landing on Earth near [[Polaris (Marvel Comics)|Polaris]], who'd seen it in space and had a similar reaction.{{Issue|date=October 2009}}\n\nThereafter, \"Phantom Torso\" stopped \"talking\" to him, and he put on a spacesuit and went out into space to die. However, he was teleported to [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]]'s sphinx-like ship, and forced to battle Dr. Foster, a human archeologist who had stumbled upon Apocalypse's tomb, for the \"right\" to become '''War''', Horseman of Apocalypse. Gazer would have lost the battle if it were not for [[Ozymandias (Marvel Comics)|Ozymandias]], Apocalypse's servant. Ozymandias told Gazer that he would owe him and one day the scribe would become the master.{{Issue|date=October 2009}}\n\nGazer went through a terribly painful process where his skeleton was stretched, the former X-Man [[Sunfire (comics)|Sunfire]], who was also chosen by Apocalypse to be a Horseman, tried to save him but Gazer had already been under Apocalypse's mind-control by then and helped recapture Shiro.{{Issue|date=October 2009}}\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Gazerdeath.PNG|left|The death of Gazer. Art by Salvador Larroca.|thumb]] -->\nAs War, Gazer was sent to battle the X-Men and Sentinel Squad O*N*E. Upon returning to Apocalypse's sphinx, he was approached by Ozymandias who wanted his debt repaid. War, no longer Gazer, did not fulfill his oath and instead revealed the truth to Apocalypse about Ozymandias' treachery.{{Issue|date=October 2009}}\n\nDuring a heated battle against the X-Men, Ozymandias finally took his vengeance, stabbing Gazer from behind with a sword.{{Issue|date=October 2009}}\n\n===Powers and abilities===\nBefore M-Day, Gazer, in addition to his unusual appearance, could absorb radiation at frequencies and levels which induce radiation sickness in normal humans and [[photosynthesis|photosynthesize]] it as food.\n\nAfter his depowerment on M-Day, he was taken by Apocalypse and transformed to possess super-strength and enhanced durability, and the ability to absorb and rechannel solar energy as blasts of fire through  his eyes. He also carries a spiked mace which flashes with electricity-like bursts, and rides a robotic horse-like flying machine.\n\n==Other versions==\n===Age of Apocalypse===\nThe original War (Kieros) appeared in the [[Age of Apocalypse]] as a member of Apocalypse's first wave of Horsemen. War was killed by Mikhail Rasputin when Apocalypse invaded Russia. Impressed by Mikhail's victory, Apocalypse captured and brainwashed Mikhail so he could join the  Horsemen of Apocalypse.{{Issue|date=January 2010}}\n\n===Mutant X===\nWar also is seen in the ''[[Mutant X (comics)|Mutant X]]'' reality, where he constantly bickered with Death, but they had a mutual respect for each other.{{Issue|date=January 2010}}\n\n==In other media==\n===Television===\n* The original War appeared in ''[[X-Men: The Animated Series]]'', voiced by James Millington.{{cn|date=August 2022}} In \"Come the Apocalypse,\" where War was selected by Apocalypse and transformed into his Horseman; the second and third, \"Beyond Good and Evil,\" Parts 3 and 4, where he fought alongside the other Horsemen when the X-Men sought out Apocalypse's Lazarus chamber. Instead of using his mutant abilities in the latter two episodes, he used an energy-projected sword. In his first appearance, he is shown not getting along with the woman who would become Pestilence, a nod to their disagreeable natures in the comics.\n\n===Film===\n* In ''[[X-Men: Apocalypse]]'', [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]] is the horseman War.{{cn|date=August 2022}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Characters created by Clayton Henry]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Louise Simonson]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Walt Simonson]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1986]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 2006]]\n[[Category:Comics set in the 15th century]]\n[[Category:Fictional axefighters]]\n[[Category:Fictional henchmen]]\n[[Category:Fictional NASA astronauts]]\n[[Category:Fictional Vietnam War veterans]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters with superhuman strength]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics mutants]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]"}]}}}}
