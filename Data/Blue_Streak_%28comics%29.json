She is also shown to possess incredible stamina. She is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] gifted with incredible speed, who left the newest incarnation of the [[X-Men]] (the [[X-People]]) because they were not \"flashy\" enough for her.

Bluestreak is characterized as cocky and impulsive, with a cheerful attitude, and is shown having problems following the orders of [[Mainframe (comics)|Mainframe]]. When Mainframe's inert body needs to be taken across the city in less than a minute, she places him on a gurney and covers the needed distance in virtually no time at all, even remarking afterwards that she could have stopped for a sandwich, but did not want to show off.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix3/bluestreakscourge.htm|Blue Streak (Don Thomas)}}\n* [http://www.marvel.wikia.com/Don_Thomas_%28Earth-616%29 Blue Streak (Don Thomas)] at Marvel Database wiki\n*{{comicbookdb|type=character|id=5929|title=Blue Streak (Don Thomas)}}\n* {{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix5/bluestreakrr.htm|Blue Streak (Jonathan Swift)}}\n* [http://marvel.wikia.com/wiki/Jonathan_Swift_%28Earth-616%29 Blue Streak (Jonathan Swift)] at Marvel Database wiki\n*{{comicbookdb|type=character|id=15907|title=Blue Streak (Jonathan Swift)}}\n*[http://marvel.wikia.com/wiki/Bluestreak_%28Telepath%29_%28Earth-616%29 Bluestreak (psychic)] at Marvel Database wiki\n*{{comicbookdb|type=character|id=18039|title=Bluestreak (psychic)}}\n\n{{S.H.I.E.L.D.}}\n{{MC2}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Blue Streak (Comics)}}\n[[Category:Characters created by John Buscema]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Mike Deodato]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Roy Thomas]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Tom DeFalco]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Warren Ellis]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1978]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1999]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 2007]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics 2]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters who can move at superhuman speeds]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics mutants]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics superheroes]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]\n[[Category:S.H.I.E.L.D. agents]]"}]}}}}
