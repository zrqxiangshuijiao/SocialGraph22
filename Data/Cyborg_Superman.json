Henshaw and the crew, including Henshaw's wife, found that their bodies had begun to mutate and, after returning to Earth, Henshaw's entire crew either perished or eventually committed suicide. After learning that [[Superman]] had thrown [[Eradicator (comics)|the Eradicator]] into the sun in a battle during the space shuttle experiment, Henshaw blames Superman for the solar flare and the accident. Before his body completely disintegrated due to the radiation exposure, Henshaw is able to save his consciousness. Using NASA communications equipment, Henshaw beamed his mind into the birthing matrix which had carried Superman from [[Krypton (comics)|Krypton]] to Earth as an infant. He creates a small exploration craft from the birthing matrix and departs into outer space alone. Becoming increasingly mentally unstable, Henshaw uses Superman's birthing matrix to create a body identical to Superman's, albeit with cybernetic parts.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Greenberger |first1=Robert |last2=Pasko |first2=Martin |title=The Essential Superman Encyclopedia |date=2010 |publisher=Del Rey |isbn=978-0-345-50108-0 |pages=64\u201365}}</ref> He returns to Earth to kill Superman, only to discover that [[The Death of Superman|Superman had already died]] during Henshaw's absence.

When the \"Death of Superman\" story arc happened in the comics, Maggs presented a very faithful, though much pared down, version of the tale which featured [[Stuart Milligan]] as Clark Kent/Superman, [[Lorelei King]] as Lois Lane, and [[William Hootkins]] as Lex Luthor. Versatile American actor [[Kerry Shale]] was cast both as the villainous Hank Henshaw and as [[Superboy]]. The story arc was packaged for sale on cassette and CD as ''[[Superman: Doomsday and Beyond]]'' in the UK and as ''[[Superman Lives!]]'' in the USA.\n\n===Miscellaneous===\n* In ''Superman/Fantastic Four: The Infinite Destruction'', a comic book crossover starring Superman and the Fantastic Four, [[Reed Richards]] and his team are forced into an uneasy alliance with Hank Henshaw when the [[Marvel Universe]]'s world-eating being [[Galactus]] kidnaps Superman and transforms him into his herald. In conversation with [[Invisible Woman|Susan Richards]], Henshaw points out the \"ironic\" similarity between his origin and the FF's. The story concludes with Galactus blasting Henshaw with a ray that turns him into a simple metal rod in response to his pleas for perfection, after the discovery that Henshaw was responsible for Superman coming to the Marvel Universe after he planted faked evidence that Galactus was involved in Krypton's destruction (having previously encountered the [[Silver Surfer]] in ''Green Lantern/Silver Surfer: Unholy Alliances'', Henshaw had learned of Galactus and sought the enhanced power of becoming his herald).\n* Hank Henshaw appeared in issue #19 of the ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold (comics)|Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' comics.
