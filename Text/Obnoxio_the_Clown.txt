The character appears in the humor magazine ''[[Crazy (magazine)|Crazy]]'' and served as its [[mascot]].<ref name=\"obnoxio\">Campbell, David (April 20, 2005). [http://daveslongbox.blogspot.com/2005/04/obnoxio-clown-marvel-comics-1983.html Obnoxio the Clown Marvel Comics, 1983], Accessed August 2008.</ref> He was created by [[Larry Hama]].\n\n==Character==\nObnoxio was portrayed as a slovenly, vulgar, cigar-puffing middle-aged man in a torn and dirty [[clown suit]], with a dyspeptic and [[Cynicism (contemporary)|cynical]] attitude.\n\n==Background==\n[[Larry Hama]] created Obnoxio immediately after he became the editor of ''Crazy''. He explained, \"I thought the old mascot was too 'nebbishy.' I wanted someone proactive, and somebody who actually had a voice, unlike all the other humor magazine mascots.\" The character's face was modeled from [[Al Milgrom]].<ref name=\"back91\">{{cite journal|last=Arnold|first=Mark|date=September 2016|title=What The--?!: Obnoxio the Clown|journal=[[Back Issue!]]|location=Raleigh, North Carolina|publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|issue=91|pages=68\u201371}}</ref>\n\nArtist [[Alan Kupperberg]], who would become heavily associated with the character, recounted, \"Obnoxio's first appearance was in a one-panel illustration to accompany a subscription ad in ''Crazy'', written by Larry and calling for likenesses of [[P. T. Barnum]] and [[William M. Tweed|Marcy Tweed]] among others. This was right up my alley, so I pulled the reference and really went to town, doing a very nice half-tone illo. I think the piece impressed Larry quite a bit, because if my memory is correct, Larry left me strictly alone on anything and everything Obnoxio the Clown-related.\" Most of the Obnoxio features were written by Virgil Diamond, who according to Hama \"was a high school English teacher in [[Brooklyn]]. I heard from him a few years ago when he retired. He really labored on those pages and was constantly fussing with them.\"<ref name=\"back91\"/>\n\n==In other media==\n===Comic books===\nObnoxio the Clown appeared in a number of single-page gags in ''[[What If (comics)|What If?]]'' #34 (August 1982).<ref name=\"back91\"/>\n\n[[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] also published a one-shot ''Obnoxio the Clown'' (titled ''Obnoxio the Clown vs. the X-Men'' on the cover) [[comic book]] in April 1983,<ref name=\"obnoxio\" /> despite the fact that ''Crazy'' had already been cancelled.<ref name=\"back91\"/> The plot centered on Obnoxio the Clown as a villain and unlikely ally of the [[X-Men]].<ref name=\"obnoxio\" /> He and the group, at the [[X-Mansion]], 'team-up' against Eye Scream, a villain who can transform into various types of ice cream.\n\nThe sole issue of the comic book was written, illustrated, colored, and lettered by [[Alan Kupperberg]];<ref>Comic Collector live.

Yes, it\u2019s untouched by human hands.\"\n\nLong after Obnoxio had disappeared from the spotlight, Marvel published two last Obnoxio the Clown stories written and drawn by Kupperberg, eight page features in ''[[What The--?!]]'' #13 (July 1991) and #24 (December 1992).\n\n===Television===\nObnoxio makes a cameo appearance in the ''[[Hulk and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H.]]'' episode \"Fear Itself\", voiced by [[John DiMaggio]]. The Agents of S.M.A.S.H. receive old television signals including a TV show starring Obnoxio which freaks [[Rick Jones (comics)|A-Bomb]] out. He somewhat appears later in the episode as a part of an illusion caused by Null that releases people's fears where Null unleashes this illusion on A-Bomb.\n\n===Video games===\nAndroid replicas of Obnoxio the Clown appear as enemies during the [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] levels in ''[[Spider-Man and the X-Men in Arcade's Revenge]]''. Though he is not seen in the game, Obnoxio the Clown is briefly mentioned in the [[Facebook]] game ''[[Marvel: Avengers Alliance]]''. Obnoxio the Clown is mentioned to have been murdered by the Circle of Eight.\n\n===Novel===\nIn the alternate reality depicted in the \"Doctor Doom: The Chaos Trilogy\" novels, written by Steven A. Roman, Obnoxio has a popular slapstick comedy show.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://daveslongbox.blogspot.com/2005/04/obnoxio-clown-marvel-comics-1983.html Obnoxio the Clown] - General information (blog).\n* [http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/iscrm.htm Marvel Appendix entry on Eye Scream, villain from the one-shot].\n\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1980]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Larry Hama]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]\n[[Category:Fictional clowns]]\n[[Category:Magazine mascots]]\n[[Category:Male characters in comics]]\n[[Category:Male characters in advertising]]\n[[Category:Mascots introduced in 1980]]"}]}}}}
