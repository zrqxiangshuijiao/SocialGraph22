Created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist/co-plotter [[Jack Kirby]], the character first appeared in [[Uncanny X-Men|''The X-Men'']] #1 (Sept. 1963). Iceman is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] born with superhuman abilities. He has the ability to manipulate ice and cold by freezing [[water vapor]] around him. This allows him to freeze objects, as well as cover his body with  [[ice]].\n\nIceman has a relatively high profile among ''X-Men'' characters due to being frequently adapted into X-Men and [[Spider-Man]]-related media, including video games, animated series, and films. The character later received widespread media attention when a storyline revealed that the character was a [[closeted]] [[gay]] man in ''[[All-New X-Men]]'' #40 (April 2015), leading to his [[coming out]]. \n\nIceman has been described as one of the most notable and powerful [[LGBT themes in comics|gay characters in comic books]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web |title=Five LGBTQ+ superheroes you need to know about |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/articles/z79gscw |access-date=2022-10-19 |website=BBC Bitesize |language=en-GB}}</ref><ref name=\":11\">{{Cite web |last=Gramuglia |first=Anthony |date=2019-03-02 |title=10 LGBTQA Characters Who Should Be Introduced To The MCU |url=https://screenrant.com/lgbtqa-characters-marvel-cinematic-universe-disversity/ |access-date=2022-10-26 |website=ScreenRant |language=en-US}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web |title=10 queer superheroes who changed the face of comics |url=https://www.sbs.com.au/topics/pride/article/2016/02/02/10-queer-superheroes-who-changed-face-comics |access-date=2022-10-19 |website=Topics |language=en}}</ref><ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web |last=Young |first=Mark |title=Here Are 11 Of The Most Important Marvel And DC Queer Superheroes. |url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/markyoung/lgbtq-marvel-and-dc-superheroes |access-date=2022-10-19 |website=BuzzFeed |language=en}}</ref><ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web |last=Baker-Whitelaw |first=Gavia |date=2018-12-11 |title=The top 12 LGBTQ superheroes in DC and Marvel comics |url=https://www.dailydot.com/parsec/lgbtq-gay-superheroes/ |access-date=2022-10-19 |website=The Daily Dot |language=en-US}}</ref><ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web |date=2022-07-21 |title=10 Most Powerful X-Men of All Time, Ranked |url=https://www.themarysue.com/10-most-powerful-x-men-of-all-time-ranked/ |access-date=2022-10-19 |website=The Mary Sue |language=en}}</ref><ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web |last=Harn |first=Darby |date=2022-02-24 |title=10 Most Powerful X-Men |url=https://screenrant.com/most-powerful-x-men-marvel-comics/ |access-date=2022-10-19 |website=ScreenRant |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nFrom 2000 to 2014, [[Shawn Ashmore]] portrayed Iceman in the [[20th Century Fox]] [[X-Men (film series)|''X-Men'' films]] and voiced the character in ''[[The Super Hero Squad Show]]''. \n\n==Publication history==\nCreated by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist/co-writer [[Jack Kirby]], the character first appeared in ''[[Uncanny X-Men|X-Men]]'' #1 ([[1963 in comics#September|September 1963]]). Lee later admitted that Iceman was created essentially as a copy of the [[Human Torch]], only using the opposite element for his power.<ref>{{cite news | last1 = O'Neill | first1 = Patrick Daniel | last2 = Lee | first2 = Stan | author-link2 = Stan Lee | date = August 1993 | title = X Marks the Spot | work = [[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]: X-Men Turn Thirty | pages = 8\u20139 | quote = Then I wanted a character sort of like the Torch.

M. DeMatteis]] and another in the 2000s by Andy Lanning and Dan Abnett, with art by [[Karl Kerschl]]. DeMatteis said of the first series, \"It was my idea, so there was no one to blame but myself.

He was a main character in the first volume of ''X-Factor'', and a star in flashback stories when he was a teenager in ''X-Men: The Hidden Years'' and ''X-Men: First Class''.\n\nIn April 2015, in issue 40 of ''All-New X-Men'', a time-displaced version of the teenaged Iceman was revealed as [[gay]] by his teammate, [[Jean Grey]], who discerned this with her telepathic ability.<ref>Hanks, Henry.

His father is [[Irish-American]] [[Catholic]], and his mother is [[Jewish-American|Jewish]].<ref>''Iceman'' #1 (Dec. 1984)</ref> Bobby's powers first manifested when he was on a date with Judy Harmon, and a local bully by the name of Rocky Beasely tried to take Judy away for himself. Knowing Judy could not put up a good fight, Bobby pointed his hand at Beasely and encased him in a block of ice. Later, the local townspeople, having heard of the incident, came looking for him in the form of an angry mob. The local sheriff had no choice but to put Bobby in jail for his own \"protection\". While Bobby sat in his cell at the sheriff station, the outer wall was blown open, and a young man named [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Scott Summers]] walked in and offered to take Bobby with him. After Bobby turned him down, the two mutants got into a short battle, which was soon ended by the arrival of [[Professor X|Professor Charles Xavier]].<ref>''The X-Men'' #44\u201346</ref>\n\nAfter Xavier spoke with Bobby and his parents, Bobby's parents suggested that he go with Professor Xavier to his \"school for gifted youngsters\". Bobby took the suggestion and left with Professor Xavier and Cyclops to become the second member of the [[X-Men]]. He is later joined by [[Beast (comics)|Henry \"Hank\" McCoy]], [[Jean Grey]], and [[Warren Worthington III]] as the founding members of the X-Men. Drake remains self-conscious regarding the fact that he is the youngest member of the group. Appearing in his original snow covered form, he first battles [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]] along with the rest of the team,<ref>''The X-Men'' #1</ref> and later the [[Brotherhood of Mutants|Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]].<ref>''The X-Men'' #4</ref> Bobby Drake's first girlfriend is Zelda.<ref>''The X-Men'' #7</ref> Not long after, he takes on a new ice-covered form.<ref name=\"X8\">''The X-Men'' #8 (November 1964)</ref> He then teams up with the [[Human Torch]] for the first time.<ref>''Strange Tales'' #120</ref> The two would become close friends as time went on. With the X-Men, he visits the [[Savage Land]] and meets [[Ka-Zar (Kevin Plunder)|Ka-Zar]] for the first time.<ref>''The X-Men'' #10</ref> He then battles the [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]],<ref>''The X-Men'' #13</ref> and is badly injured in his first battle against the [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinels]].<ref>''The X-Men'' #14\u201317</ref> He next battles Magneto by himself.<ref>''The X-Men'' #18</ref> Later, he visits [[Subterranea (comics)|Subterranea]] for the first time.<ref>''The X-Men'' #34</ref> Then, he and Beast battle the [[Maha Yogi]].<ref>''The X-Men'' #47</ref> During his original stint with the X-Men, Drake pursues a relationship with [[Polaris (Marvel Comics)|Lorna Dane]], although the relationship does not last. Iceman is among the original X-Men captured by [[Krakoa]], leading to a new incarnation of X-Men of which he is not a member. With most of the original team, he quits the X-Men.<ref>''The X-Men'' #94</ref>\n\n===Champions and Defenders===\nIceman moves to the American west coast to attend [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] and becomes a founding member of [[Champions (1975 team)|The Champions]] of Los Angeles.<ref>''The Champions'' #1 (Oct. 1975)</ref> However, the Champions soon dissolve.<ref>''Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man'' #17</ref>\n\nIceman is then abducted by [[Master Mold]], and alongside Angel, he encounters the [[Hulk]].<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #7</ref> Iceman next aids the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] in battling the [[Circus of Crime]].<ref>''Marvel Two-in-One'' #76</ref> Drake retires from life as a superhero to earn a college degree in accounting \u2013 but apparently at a college on the east coast, not UCLA.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #145, p. 10, panel 1.

Iceman journeys back in time and meets his parents before he was born, and battles Oblivion and Mirage. He then reconciles with his parents.<ref>''Iceman'' #1\u20134</ref>\n\n===X-Factor===\nThe original X-Men, including Iceman, reunite to form the superhero team [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]].<ref>''X-Factor'' #1 (February 1986)</ref> With this new team, he encounters [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] for the first time.<ref>''X-Factor'' #6</ref>\n\nDuring his time with the team, [[Loki (Marvel Comics)|Loki]] captures Bobby, hoping to use him to gain control over the [[Giants (Marvel Comics)|Frost Giants]]. Loki enhances Bobby's powers and then extracts them to restore the size of the [[Giants (Marvel Comics)|Frost Giants]]. Iceman is rescued by [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]].<ref>''Thor'' #377\u2013378</ref> Loki's tampering increases Bobby's powers to such an extent that he begins to lose control of his abilities. During a later battle with the [[The Right (comics)|Right]], he is fitted with a power-dampening belt which actually helps him control his abilities. Once able only to sheathe his own body in a protective coating of ice, Bobby finds he can encase the entirety of the [[Empire State Building]]. With time, Bobby gains sufficient control over his augmented powers and is able to stop using the inhibitor belt. Believing he has achieved his full potential, Bobby does not attempt to develop his abilities further.\n\nWith X-Factor, Bobby then defeats [[Horsemen of Apocalypse|Apocalypse's Horsemen]].<ref>''X-Factor'' #19</ref> Iceman helps watch over many of the younger superheroes, something he once was. Most notably, he and Beast help [[Tabitha Smith|Boom Boom]] gain a more normal life. For a brief while, he also helps supervise the [[New Mutants]] and their sister team, the [[X-Terminators]]. They, in turn, save him from the deadly kiss of [[Infectia]].<ref>''X-Factor'' #29\u201331</ref>\n\nBobby also develops a romantic relationship with [[Opal Tanaka]]. After a session of ice sledding, she discovers threatening mail in her mailbox, a precursor to harassment by her cybernetically enhanced relatives of the Tatsu Clan of the Yakuza, which Bobby helps her out with.<ref>''X-Factor'' #63\u201364</ref>\n\nAfter the \"[[Muir Island Saga]]\", Iceman rejoins the X-Men along with the rest of X-Factor.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #281; ''X-Men'' #1</ref>\n\n===Back with the X-Men===\nWhen he rejoined the X-Men it seemed that he learned to control his powers and no longer needed the inhibitor belt, this made him believe he reached the limit of his powers.<ref>''X-Factor'' #70</ref> The X-Men were separated into two groups, Iceman was placed in the gold team, led by [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], along with fellow original X-Men Jean Grey (now without a code name) and Archangel.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #281</ref>\n\nOne day he took Opal to eat with his parents, however his dad began humiliating her because of her Japanese heritage. The four are attacked by the Cyber-Samurai, which added to William Drake's prejudices about the girl.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #289</ref> When Bobby came across [[Mikhail Rasputin]] he used his mutant abilities on him. Bobby discovered that his potential was still far from being reached as he converted his body into ice, not just covered by it.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #292</ref> By turning his entire body to ice, instead of just wearing an icy exterior, Bobby now was capable of using his power in new, aggressive ways, adding spikes and padding to his ice structure.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #300</ref>\n\nToo busy with the many threats that the X-Men faced every day, Bobby let his relationship with Opal deteriorate and, when they finally saw each other again after weeks, it was only to save her from an attack by mutant haters. Annoyed that she could only gain his attention by nearly getting killed, Opal broke off their relationship.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #305</ref>\n\nLater, as he was checking on [[Emma Frost]] who was in a comatose state after the mutant [[Trevor Fitzroy]] unleashed the mutant-hunting Sentinels on Emma Frost and her students known as the [[Hellions (Marvel Comics)|Hellions]], the mansion was hit by an electricity breakdown.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #311</ref> Emma woke up disoriented, possessed Bobby's mind, and used his powers in ways Bobby never had; she froze an entire river and traveled through water. She was looking for her pupils but after finding out they were dead, she left Bobby's body.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #314</ref>\n\nBobby invites Rogue to tag along on a visit to his parents. Wrongly assuming a romantic relation, his father disapproves of Rogue, verbally attacking them with the same prejudices he expressed with Opal. This time, Bobby had enough and left after telling his father that he should just accept the fact that he is a mutant and he would never fit the definition he has of normal. He was upset that Emma exhibited greater control of his powers than he had. Since Rogue was having problems with Gambit, the two of them go on a road trip to ease their minds.<ref name=\"Uncanny319\"/>\n\nDuring the Legion Quest, Iceman was one of the X-Men who went back in time to stop [[Legion (Marvel Comics)|Legion]] from killing Magneto. They succeed, but only partially. Legion does not kill Magneto, but instead accidentally murdered Xavier, his own father, years before Legion had been conceived much less born. This paradox caused the events of the [[Age of Apocalypse]]. At the last moment before the original reality ended, Iceman's fellow X-Men, Rogue and Gambit shared a kiss. When reality resumed, Rogue's mind-absorbing touch renders Gambit comatose. Having absorbed some secret haunting memories, she needs to get away from the X-Men and Iceman volunteers to join her on a road trip, though at the same time he was starting to see visions of Emma Frost. When Gambit awoke from his coma, he tracked them down and confronted Rogue about what she saw in his mind. She broke off their relationship, Iceman and Gambit returned to the X-Men.<ref>''X-Men'' #45</ref>\n\nWhen the entity known as [[Onslaught (Marvel Comics)|Onslaught]] first appeared, Iceman was chosen as one of his test subjects, along with Storm, Cyclops and Wolverine. They were pitted against a servant of Onslaught named [[Post (comics)|Post]], in a specific battle area of harsh environment to test the extent of their abilities. They won and were returned to the mansion. However, Iceman's chest had been shattered in his ice form during battle, making it impossible to change back to human form.<ref>''X-Men'' (Vol 2) #50. Marvel Comics.</ref> He confronted Emma Frost and demanded to know what she did to his powers in his body and how to save himself. She refused to help since she knew that Bobby would have to do it himself. When he captured her with his ice powers, she telepathically showed him his insecurities. By confronting Opal and his father in her simulation, Iceman realized that Emma was right and managed to transform back to his human body with his chest fully intact.<ref name=\"Uncanny X-Men #331\">''The Uncanny X-Men'' #331</ref>\n\nWhen Graydon Creed was running for President (with a heavy anti mutant campaign), Bobby was chosen to infiltrate in the campaign. His father stood out in a crowd and spoke in favor of the mutants, which came as a surprise to Bobby. His father's connection with Bobby was discovered, so the people that worked for Graydon captured him and almost beat him to death. Bobby decided to stay away from the X-Men for a while to be with his dad.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #340</ref>\n\nZero Tolerance came across and Bobby found and helped Cecilia Reyes who was trying to keep a secret that she was a mutant. They also joined with Charlotte Jones and the Morlock Marrow. After Bastion was defeated, he took Cecilia and Marrow to the mansion, and soon left the X-Men again for a while to be with his parents.<ref>''X-Men'' #69</ref>\n\nMuch later, the X-Men found evidence in one of Destiny's journals of a group known as the Twelve, including Xavier, Magneto, Cyclops, Phoenix, Iceman, Polaris, Storm, Cable, Bishop, Sunfire, Mikhail Rasputin and the [[Living Monolith]]. They also learned that the Apocalypse's Horsemen had been kidnapping these mutants from around the globe. Iceman was captured in the woods near his home by Deathbird, who had become the Horseman War.<ref>''X-Men'' #96</ref> Gathering the remaining Twelve, the X-Men traveled to Egypt and confronted Apocalypse and the Skrulls. Apocalypse and his forces captured all of the Twelve during the battle, using them in a ritual to give the Chaos-Bringer a new body and incredible power. Magneto and Polaris created opposite magnetic polarities, Iceman, Storm, and Sunfire provided elemental extremes, Cyclops, Phoenix, and Cable gave the sheer power of family, Xavier represented the power of mind and Bishop and Mikhail stood for time and space, while the Monolith linked all their energies together. Nate Grey was to be Apocalypse's new host, a powerhouse to store his massive lifeforce. The Twelve managed to free themselves and Cyclops sacrificed his own body and life force to keep Apocalypse from getting Nate. Though the new Apocalypse was defeated, Cyclops seemed lost forever.<ref>''X-Men'' #97</ref>\n\nAfter that incident, Iceman helped the Beast to secretly enter Genosha, as he wanted to study the legacy-infected mutates. When the High Evolutionary released his anti-mutation wave, they were trapped in the war-ravaged country. With the aid of Magneto, they escaped and joined forces with the rest of the scattered X-Men. They raided the Evolutionary's satellite, disabled the mutation field and defeated Sinister, who had been manipulating the Evolutionary.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #379</ref><ref>''X-Men'' #99</ref><ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #380</ref>\n\nIceman was recruited by the living ship [[Prosh (Marvel Comics)|Prosh]], along with other mutants, like Jean Grey, Mystique, Toad and Juggernaut, to preserve evolution and save it. In this journey Iceman developed his powers even further, which led him to no longer be afraid of the natural course of his powers and he returned to the X-Men.<ref>''X-Men Forever'' #1\u20135</ref> He joined a new team of X-Men, consisting of Angel, [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]], Wolverine and Chamber. He was using his abilities in a whole new way now, just channelling the power and not turning his body into ice.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #395</ref>\n\n===Second mutation===\n{{MOS|date=March 2015}}\nDuring a heated battle with a recently evolved [[Black Tom Cassidy]], he received a chest wound. After returning to normal his chest did not fully recover and some parts of it remained icy, and he was unable to return them to normal. At first he became afraid of it but in time it made him gain a new attitude in life, even rude at some times.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #413</ref>\n\nNobody seemed to realize it at the time, but evidently this was an early sign of Iceman undergoing a secondary mutation of his own. When he repeatedly tried to evade his regular medical check-ups, school nurse [[Annie Ghazikhanian]] recognized that something odd was going on with him and pressured him to show her the wound. Bobby made her promise not to tell anyone and showed her that parts of his chest are now made of ice and he is unable to change them back to flesh and blood. Iceman wonders if he will entirely turn into ice on a permanent basis.<ref name=\"Uncanny X-Men #415\">''The Uncanny X-Men'' #415</ref>\n\nHe developed an attitude that, to some of the newer addition to the X-Men, like [[Stacy X]], [[Juggernaut (Marvel Comics)|Juggernaut]] and [[Northstar (Marvel Comics)|Northstar]], he comes across as rather arrogant, denouncing their status as team members, as they have not been around as long as he. Iceman even went as far as offending [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] by claiming that only the original five, and no one else, has the right to call themselves an X-Man.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #420</ref>\n\nBobby was further frustrated when Havok and Polaris announced their imminent wedding, him having carried a torch for Lorna for quite some time. In his frustration he turned to Annie, who had problems with the wedding too, as she was secretly in love with Havok. The nurse surprised him with the accusation of him being a racist \u2013 feeling comfortable as a mutant who could pass like a human when needed, opposed to being a fully obvious mutant or a \"mere\" human. With his secondary mutation manifesting, though, Iceman was in danger of losing this status. Shocked by the truth of her words, Bobby fully opened up about his fears, that as a man fully made of ice he could never feel the warmth of a physical relationship again. Touched, Annie allowed him to kiss her, but when Havok called off the wedding, wanting to be with Annie instead, she quickly dumped Bobby.<ref name=\"Uncanny X-Men #426\">''The Uncanny X-Men'' #426</ref>\n\nUpon encountering [[Azazel (Marvel Comics)|Azazel]] and his followers, Iceman's body is shattered from the neck down. Afterward, he regains his entire ice form, but cannot change back to his human appearance. As a result, Bobby becomes both bitter and despondent because of this drastic change.<ref name=\"Uncanny X-Men #429\">''The Uncanny X-Men'' #429</ref>\n\n===Rogue's Team===\nIceman joins [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]]'s team after she tells him that she wants him as a member.{{issue|date=March 2018}} Their first mission as a team is to fight a new threat, a powerful group known as the [[Children of the Vault]].<ref>''X-Men'' #188 (July 2006)</ref> The team is successful and during this time, Bobby learns that he can be completely destroyed but then pull himself back together again. It was shown several times during the arc.\n\nThe next mission for the team was to locate a man called Pandemic and defeat him.

They are pursued by [[Sunfire (comics)|Sunfire]]; they manage to get the better of him and take him prisoner, but not before he manages to cripple the jet. While Sunfire is unconscious, Iceman and Sam discuss the Mauraders' plan to eliminate all precognitive mutants and anyone with knowledge of the future as well as retrieving Destiny's Diaries before the Marauders can. During this time, Bobby displayed sub-atomic control of energy transfers when he prevented Sunfire from using his fire-based powers.<ref>''X-Men'' #202</ref>\n\nCannonball and Bobby, telepathically prompted by Emma Frost, attempt to recover the diaries which are hidden in a dilapidated brewery. Mr. Sinister uses the reverse-engineered version of Xavier's [[Cerebro]] to track the pair of X-Men to the brewery. The Marauders attack Cannonball and Iceman and overtake them. Bobby, while in his ice form, suffers a gunshot wound from Mystique, which severs one of his arms above the elbow. Mister Sinister, who takes Cannonball prisoner, attempts to telepathically erase his mind so that the X-Men will find him as an empty shell.

[[Pixie (X-Men)|Pixie]] teleported them back to the mansion in a rush, but the entire team was scattered between D.C. and Westchester. Iceman, after recovering from his injuries, volunteered to go look for them and was given telepathic directions by [[Emma Frost]].<ref>''New X-Men'' #45</ref>\n\nIceman was successful in finding the New X-Men, most of them injured. On the way back, they found that the [[Sentinel Squad O*N*E|O*N*E* Sentinels]] guarding the [[Xavier Institute for Higher Learning|Xavier Institute]] had become infected by nano-Sentinels and attacked the school. Iceman and New X-Man [[X-23]] helped out in the battle with the O*N*E* Sentinels.

However, the [[Human Torch]] objects to Iceman's presence during the battle, emphatically asserting that Iceman was ''never'' a member of the FF. Iceman states that he ''was'' made a member during an adventure involving Namor. The Torch simply counters with \"''That didn't COUNT!''\"<ref>''Fantastic Four'' vol. 6 #2\u20134</ref>\n\nAs recounted in ''Fantastic Four'' vol. 6 #24, Iceman's induction into the FF did not feature Namor, but occurred during the early days of the FF and the original X-Men. One morning years ago, the youthful Torch 'quit' the FF in an immature fit of pique. That same day, the sensitive teen-aged Iceman left the X-Men after being laughed at by his peers for his poor showing in a [[Danger Room]] exercise. Iceman encountered the remaining FF members and assisted them with a day-long series of crises, being casually admitted to the team as a result. When the Torch discovered that he had been replaced, he attacked Iceman during the FF's current battle and forcefully declared that Iceman was ''not'' an FF member. The [[Invisible Woman|Invisible Girl]] forced the pair to work together to help defeat the FF's final opponent of the day. Iceman was then telepathically summoned back to the X-Men by Professor X, who praised his student's performance. Mr. Fantastic told the departing Iceman that he could return to the FF whenever he wanted. The Torch was also 'readmitted', with a penance of a week's laundry detail.<ref name=\"Fantastic Four vol. 6 #24\">''Fantastic Four'' vol. 6 #24</ref>\n\nIn the present time, Iceman returns the teen-aged [[Franklin Richards (comics)|Franklin Richards]] to the FF's [[Yancy Street]] home/headquarters from [[Krakoa]] and is recognized by the building's security system as an FF member. This angers the Torch once again, and he declares that Iceman had ''never'' been a member of the team. The two men bicker over the issue until Iceman realizes that the Torch was never upset about Iceman replacing him on the ''team'', but believes that he was trying to take his place in the FF ''family''. The Torch finally admits that what bothered him most was that other substitute members\u2014who were also considered family by the FF\u2014were always brought in due to major events, and that if Iceman was the actual first substitute member, that meant the Torch had given up his place \"over nothing.\" The Torch ultimately drops the matter of Iceman's legitimacy and says that he was an official substitute FF member, and is also a part of the FF 'family'.<ref name=\"Fantastic Four vol. 6 #24\"/>\n\n===Solo series===\nAfter being outed as gay by the time-displaced [[Jean Grey]], the younger time-displaced Iceman confronts his older self, asking him why he has been presenting as straight for most of his adult life. The older Bobby breaks down and admits that he has known he was gay for a long time but forcibly repressed that part of himself, fearful of how others would react. He further acknowledges that he was scared to reveal his true self to the world due to already facing prejudice for being a mutant and not wanting to receive hatred for another part of himself.<ref name=\"Uncanny X-Men #600\"/> Following all of this, Bobby decides to take a break from the limelight and focus on himself, declining to join the [[X-Men Gold|new X-team]] formed by [[Kitty Pryde]], instead acting as a reserve member and teaching classes at the Xavier School. After a training session with his younger self, Bobby sees the time-displaced Iceman head out for a date with his boyfriend Romeo while he tries to set up an online dating profile to meet guys. He receives a text from his mother stating that his father has had a heart attack so Bobby rushes to the hospital only to be chastises by his father for missing family events due to his commitments as a superhero. Following a brief battle in the hospital, Bobby's parents ask him to leave, angry that their mutant son is bringing yet more trouble into their lives.<ref>''Iceman'' vol. 3 #1</ref> On a mission with Kitty to rescue a new mutant, she confronts Bobby about being gay, asking why he could not tell her himself, meaning she had to find out from a secondary source. She reassures him that she only wants to help him and lets him know she is there if he ever wants to talk but suggests he should come out to his parents. Bobby arranges dinner with his family but he is constantly subjected anti-mutant rhetoric from his parents. The dinner is interrupted by a gang of [[Purifiers (Marvel Comics)|Purifiers]] but, although Iceman takes them down quickly and the lives of his parents, they are angry that their house has been destroyed because of him and send him away (although his mother promises to try and convince his father to visit him at the X-Mansion).<ref>''Iceman'' vol. 3 #2\u20133</ref> When the mutant that he and Kitty rescues goes missing, Iceman tracks him to a nearby nightclub where he discovers that [[Daken]] is responsible for luring him away. Daken tries to flirt with Bobby to distract him but Iceman freezes him and attempts to convince the mutant to return to the Xavier School, though he refuses. Daken mocks Bobby, saying that he can smell his fear and insecurity. Upon returning, Kitty surprises Bobby by revealing that his parents have arrived for a visit. He tells them he is gay and they both react negatively, angry that their son is both a mutant and a gay man. They chastise him for letting everyone else find out before them and try to convince him that he is straight, due to having been with women in the past. The family argument is interrupted by [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]], who attacks the school looking for the [[X-Men Blue|young X-Men]]. Iceman defeats him by pushing his powers and returns to the mansion to find his father is still there. He had obtained Bobby's draft of a coming out letter from Kitty and the two men begin to reconcile.<ref>''Iceman'' vol. 3 #4\u20135</ref>\n\nBobby reconnects with his former [[Champions (1975 team)|Champions]] teammates, [[Angel (comics)|Angel]], [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]], [[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|Ghost Rider]] and [[Darkstar (Marvel Comics)|Darkstar]], so they reminisce about their time with [[Black Widow (Natasha Romanova)|Black Widow]]. Bobby runs into a guy, Judah, while out shopping and he agrees to meet him that night at a local gay bar, with the rest of the Champions acting as his wingmen. The date appears to be going well but is interrupted by an attack by some [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinels]].<ref>''Iceman'' vol. 3 #6</ref> Bobby's relationship with Judah continues to develop and he decides to move to L.A. to be closer to him. While fighting [[Pyro (Marvel Comics)|Pyro]] with his younger self, Bobby explains that his mother has finally made contact with him for the first time since he came out and that she wants to invite both of them to dinner. Time-displaced Iceman agrees on the condition that Bobby tries to talk sense into Romeo, who hasn't called him in weeks. Meanwhile, Daken begins training his new mutant prot\u00e9g\u00e9e for a secret mission. When both the younger Bobby and the older Bobby arrive at the restaurant, their parents see the younger Bobby as a chance to raise a new son in a way that suits them but the time-displaced Iceman refuses, saying that he is still gay and wants to live life on his own terms before they both storm out.<ref>''Iceman'' vol. 3 #8</ref> During Bobby's moving away party at the X-Mansion, Daken uses the Purifiers to distract the other X-Men while he and his apprentice infiltrate the school and ambush Bobby. The young mutant uses his levelled-up powers to increase Daken's strength by turning him into [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse's]] horseman Death and he mortally wounds Judah with his claws before engaging Iceman in combat. Bobby manages to defeat Daken with a kiss which freezes Death's powers but Daken escapes and Judah breaks up with Bobby because his life is too much for him to deal with.<ref>''Iceman'' vol. 3 #10</ref>\n\nAfter teaming with [[Bishop (X-Men)|Bishop]] to help the [[Morlocks (comics)|Morlocks]] who came under threat by [[Mister Sinister]], Bobby finds himself approached by [[Emma Frost]] who asks him for his help. Ignoring Kitty's protests, he agrees and Emma explains that her Father, who subjected her brother [[Christian Frost|Christian]] to conversion therapy before having him institutionalized, has recently let him out and reinstalled him as the new heir to the Frost business empire. When they arrive, they discover that Christian has murdered their Father and is exhibiting his own powers. Bobby and Emma help to free Christian from his mental breakdown and Emma decides to stay with him.<ref>''Iceman'' vol. 4 #1\u20132</ref> Joining with his friends [[Spider-Man (Peter Parker)|Spider-Man]] and [[Firestar (Marvel Comics)|Firestar]], Bobby discovers that Sinister was behind the attack on the Morlocks and confronts him in his safehouse. Sinister, intent on trying to unlock the secrets of Iceman's DNA by dissecting him, sends forth an army of experimental ice creatures but Bobby's Omega Level powers absorb them all into him and he fires Mister Sinister into space.<ref>''Iceman'' vol. 4 #3\u20135</ref> Celebrating his birthday, Bobby is confronted by [[Battle of the Atom|Ice Wizard]], a future version of himself from an alternate timeline. Ice Wizard warns Bobby that he must quit the X-Men and stop using his powers to avoid a world-destroying series of events happening. He explains that Daken seduces him and manipulates him into sacrificing the other X-Men before betraying him and gaining [[Thanos]]-level powers. Bobby is adamant that this won't happen and the two engage in battle. [[Jean Grey]] arrives and Bobby finally confronts her for the actions of her younger self when she outed him. Bobby explains to Ice Wizard that he is going to live life on his terms and that nobody, not even his future self, is going to decide for him. Bobby returns to his birthday celebration where Christian arrives and hands him a large sum of money which Bobby gives to the Morlocks.

Iceman is immune to sub-zero temperatures; he is also able to perceive the [[thermal energy]] level of objects around him. Because [[cold]] is the absence of heat, Iceman does not actually 'emanate' cold; rather, he decreases thermal energy.

Upon further training in the use of his powers, he was able to fashion an armor of solid ice around his body when using his powers, which afforded him some degree of protection against concussive force and projectiles. Later on, he manifested the ability to convert the tissue of his body into organic ice. He sometimes augments his organic ice form with razor sharp adornments to his shoulders, elbows, knees, and fists. Iceman has also been able to move rapidly to another distant location while in his organic ice form, being able to deposit his bodily mass into a river and reconstitute his entire mass a great distance away in a matter of minutes (by temporarily merging his molecules with those of the river). On one occasion, Iceman suffered a severe chest injury while in his ice form and was able to heal himself by converting back into his normal human form.{{Issue|date=February 2011}}\n\nIceman is also able to reconstitute his organic ice form if any part of it is damaged, or even if it is completely shattered, without permanently harming himself.<ref name=\":4\" /> He can temporarily add the mass of a body of water to his own, increasing his mass, size, and strength.

He can also transform his body from a gaseous state back to a solid, although it is physically and mentally taxing.<ref name=\"X-Men vol. 2 #190\"/><ref>''X-Men'' #193</ref> Iceman can also freeze sea water, as seen during the \"[[Operation: Zero Tolerance]]\" [[story arc]]. While he usually does not use his powers in lethal ways, his powers are so vast that they extend to the molecular level, to the point that he can freeze all of the molecules of an object/being with a thought; he once froze every single molecule of water within the body of [[Legion (Marvel Comics)|David Haller]].<ref>''X-Men'' #41</ref> Iceman is also able to dissolve his own icy constructs.<ref name=\"Uncanny319\"/>\n\nIceman's powers were pushed to their limit while possessed by Emma Frost, who used Iceman to discover the fate of her [[Hellions (Marvel Comics)|Hellions]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Bacon |first=Thomas |date=2020-04-29 |title=The X-Men's Iceman Has A Secret Superpower |url=https://screenrant.com/xmen-iceman-secret-power-shapeshifter/ |access-date=2022-10-19 |website=ScreenRant |language=en-US}}</ref> During this time Iceman was able to control all forms of moisture, freeze fluids inside people's bodies, travel as a liquid, solid or gas.

[[Comic Book Resources]].</ref>\n\n==Characterization==\n\n===Personality===\nAccording to writer Mike Carey \"one of Iceman's best personality traits is that emotionally Bobby Drake is like the ice he manipulates\u2014not cold but transparent. 'He's devastatingly honest. He is very up-front with his emotions and his thoughts all the time.'\"<ref name=\"Carey\"/> \"Also, he's obviously incredibly brave both in terms of facing external, physical danger as well as facing up to unpleasant situations and admitting his own mistakes.\"<ref name=\"Carey\"/>\n\n===Friendships and relationships===\nIceman had a brief relationship with a Japanese-American New Yorker named Opal Tanaka. He subsequently exhibited strong feelings for his fellow X-Man [[Polaris (Marvel Comics)|Polaris]], but she did not return those feelings, due to her feelings towards Havok. [[Northstar (Marvel Comics)|Northstar]] developed an unrequited crush for Iceman during their time on the same team, though Iceman never did find out about this.<ref name=\"Uncanny X-Men #415\"/> Iceman later had a brief relationship with the Xavier School's nurse, Annie, but she eventually left him for Havok, who had just left Polaris at the altar.<ref name=\"Uncanny X-Men #426\"/> When Iceman attempted to rekindle his relationship with Polaris, that too ended abruptly, and Polaris returned to Havok.<ref name=\"Uncanny X-Men #429\"/> Iceman then had a relationship with the X-Men's enemy Mystique, who later betrayed him, despite her continued fixation on him, in as much as she stated that she would either kill him or cure him of his personal uncertainty.<ref name=\"X-Men: Manifest Destiny #3\"/>\n\nIceman has long-lasting friendships with [[Spider-Man]], [[Firestar (Marvel Comics)|Firestar]] and the [[Human Torch]].\n\n===Sexuality===\nIn ''All-New X-Men'' #40, the time-displaced Iceman is revealed to be gay, which eventually forces the youth to confront the adult version of himself about the matter. As both speak, the adult Iceman confirms the fact and that he had put all his energy into just being an X-Man as he couldn't cope with being a mutant and gay simultaneously. With the help of his younger self and Jean Grey, however, he finally comes to terms with his own sexuality,<ref name=\"Uncanny X-Men #600\"/> and comes out to fellow gay X-Man [[Anole (comics)|Anole]] in ''Extraordinary X-Men'' #6. The end of the Extermination X-Men event saw the redirecting of the time displaced version of Bobby back into the \"closet\" when he returned to his original timeline alongside the other X-Men, due to a mind lock by Jean Grey. In the present day, the current version retains both sets of memories and remains an out gay man.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbr.com/extermination-x-men-breakdown/|title=Extermination: Every Major Change Made to the X-Men|date=28 December 2018|website=CBR}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\n\n=== Critical reception ===\nPeter Eckhardt of ''[[CBR.com]]'' referred to Iceman as \"the biggest name amongst queer X-Men,\" writing, \"Iceman is an Omega-Level mutant and a longtime fan-favorite character.

There\u2019s something incredibly charming about a guy who could become the Indomitable Iceman, laying waste to enemies with his icy wrath, yet he chooses to stay boy-next-door Bobby Drake, a funny, self-sacrificing guy who values being a friend and hero over becoming the most powerful guy in the room. Being gay has a lot in common with being a mutant, as excellently displayed during Iceman\u2019s \u201ccoming out\u201d scene in X2: X-Men United. You\u2019re born that way, you will face bullying and discrimination for it, and those who claim to be your friends and family may turn their backs on you because of it. Bobby\u2019s experiences as both a mutant and an out gay man would make him an incredibly empathetic and understanding partner, one who would share his feelings and be there to help with yours.

He was soon brought to Earth-616 by the Dark Beast, where he joined forces with Archangel on his quest to eradicate all life on Earth so he could create a new evolution process.{{issue|date=December 2011}} Tired of seeing the people he cared about being killed fighting what he thought to be an unwinnable war, Drake agreed to help Archangel \u2013 despite the latter's now being the mainstream Marvel Universe's version of Drake's X-Men's arch-enemy, Apocalypse \u2013 in exchange for transport to the relative paradise that was Earth-616.{{issue|date=October 2012}}\n\nAfter X-Force defeated Archangel, Bobby managed to escape with McCoy and most of Archangel's other minions, but eventually broke away from them and went into hiding, living a life of hedonistic bliss in [[Madripoor]]. The \"Age of Apocalypse\" version of Nightcrawler \u2013 who, after being brought to Earth-616 along with the rest of his world's X-Men to help take down Archangel, decided to stay behind there in order to track down and kill the various villains who also came to the mainstream Marvel Universe \u2013 eventually tracked Bobby down to execute him for his treason. Nightcrawler is quickly overwhelmed by Drake's avatars, but eventually forces Iceman into a factory boiler room, where there's not enough moisture in the air for him to effectively use his powers. Nightcrawler quickly disables his former friend, and shoves him into an incinerator, killing the once noble hero.{{issue|date=May 2012}}\n\n===''Earth X''===\nDuring the miniseries ''[[Earth X]]'', Bobby had become trapped in his ice form, making him vulnerable to melting.  He moves to the [[Arctic]] regions of Earth, and made an ice city for himself and the [[Inuit]]. Due to a series of events where Earth's orbital path moves, Bobby is able to return to the [[United States]] to aid in the battle against the demon [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]].\n\n===\"House of M\"===\nIn the alternate timeline of the \"[[House of M]]\" storyline, Iceman was seen in Magneto's army during his rise to power.<ref>''Civil War: House of M'' #1</ref> Bobby later appears as one of the [[Horsemen of Apocalypse#House of M|Horsemen]] of [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] because Apocalypse rescued Bobby from a mutant internment camp that his parents had sent him to. Magneto sends Apocalypse to dispose of his rival [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]]; when Apocalypse is attacked en route by Black Panther's allies, Iceman aids him by freezing [[Namor]] solid and attempting to attack Storm, but he is severely injured by Sunfire.<ref>''Black Panther'' vol. 4 #7</ref>\n\n===''Marvel Zombies''===\nA zombified Iceman appears in ''Marvel Zombies: Dead Days'' alongside zombies Wolverine and Cyclops.{{issue|date=November 2012}} Ultimately, he is seen attacking Magneto. But Iceman perished at the hands of the Master Of Magnetism himself when Iceman is cut apart.{{issue|date=November 2012}}\n\n===''Mutant X''===\nIn the [[Mutant X (comics)|Mutant X]] universe, the [[Asgard (comics)|Asgardian]] god [[Loki (Marvel Comics)|Loki]] amplified Bobby's powers to a dangerous level, leaving him unable to touch any living thing without killing it. Despite this, he retains a jovial and optimistic personality. When Havok has a disagreement with [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]] and decides to leave the X-Men, Ice-Man is one of those who follow him, becoming a founding member of the Six, who eventually come to be considered the world's premiere mutant team.<ref>''Mutant X'' #1 (Oct. 1998)</ref>\n\n===''New Exiles''===\nAfter the New Exiles land on the world of warring empires, they encounter Dame Emma Frost, head of Britain's Department X and founder of Force-X.

Though never outright mentioned, he may had a relationship with Kitty Pryde and even fathered a son with her, denoting the existence of Carmen Drake, a boy with the powers of both Iceman and Shadowcat.<ref>''Wolverine and the X-Men'' #29</ref> He has also developed the ability to create semi-independent ice structures that can act on their own, although one of these structures, possessing a Hulk-like physique and intellect, has gone on to join the future version of the Brotherhood, resulting in the Brotherhood using the duplicate to reinforce the illusion of themselves as the future X-Men. The duplicate Iceman was defeated by the O5 Iceman, the present Iceman, and the future Iceman during the battle in the past (Prompting the youngest Iceman to note that they only needed one more Iceman for a five-a-side basketball team).<ref name=\"WolX37\"/>\n\nIcemaster later returned to the mainstream marvel universe and confronts Iceman about trusts and decisions. He does it in order to prevent him from doing the same mistakes Icemaster did in the future. Knowing he had little time left, Icemaster eventually revealed to Iceman that after beginning a relationship with Daken, they both led the X-Men to space in order to prevent the Shi'ar from overwhelm the Earth and lay waste to it. However Icemaster would discover that Daken's plan was actually to obtain the M'Kraan Crystal in the first place, killing in the process the other X-Men and later Deathbird herself. Icemaster attempts to stop Daken, but he is seconds too late as having the Nexus of all Realities made Daken a Thanos-level player in the cosmos, and he acted as such. Icemaster eventually became convinced, after seeing Bobby's character growth, that his present self had matured beyond what he remembered, leaving the future open for new decisions to be made. With his mission apparently completed, Icemaster turns into thin air soon afterwards.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men: Winter's End'' #1</ref>\n\n===Ronin===\nIn the alternate reality of ''X-Men: Ronin'' Iceman is a murderous ninja in the employ of the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]].
