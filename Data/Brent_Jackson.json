He first appeared in ''[[Wolverine (comic book)|Wolverine]]'' #163 and was created by [[Frank Tieri (comic book writer)|Frank Tieri]] and [[Sean Chen (artist)|Sean Chen]].\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nBrent Montgomery Jackson was first seen as an Agent of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]<ref>''Weapon X'' #4</ref> When [[Wolverine (character)|Logan]] was framed for the murder of Senator Walsh, [[Nick Fury]] could not bring him in due to a conflict of interests. Instead Brent Jackson was dispatched to organize the capture. Fury, suspecting Jackson would have Logan killed, hired a bounty hunter named the Shiver Man to capture Logan first. The Shiver Man failed, however, and Jackson managed to trap Logan with the help of a Nick Fury [[Life Model Decoy]]. An infuriated Fury decided to send the Shiver Man to monitor Jackson.{{issue|date=April 2013}}\n\nJackson was actually working for the Weapon X program under new director [[Malcolm Colcord]]. Jackson's job was to retrieve Wolverine and imprison him in The Cage, a high-powered prison. Wolverine would then be handed over to [[Sabretooth (comics)|Victor Creed]], who was also working for Weapon X.<ref>''Weapon X'' #9</ref>\n\nMalcolm Colcord began to distrust Jackson later on, and during an argument over [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]]'s loyalties and criminal behavior, Colcord slapped Jackson.<ref>''Weapon X'' #15</ref> When Jackson tried to attack Colcord in retaliation, he learned that he had an implanted chip that prevented him from doing so. Colcord then suspended him from duty and imprisoned him. Eventually, the director decided to return Jackson to duty but under close observation.<ref>''Weapon X'' #16</ref>\n\nJackson then cleverly worked to gain the trust of misfit agents such as [[Wild Child (comics)|Wild Child]], [[Sauron (comics)|Sauron]], and [[Washout (comics)|Washout]].<ref>''Weapon X'' #25</ref> When Colcord became wrapped up in his newfound relationship with Agent [[Aurora (comics)|Aurora]], Jackson used this moment to stage a coup with his small faction of agents and a truce with the Underground. Upon his success, he turned on the Underground and declared himself the new director of Weapon X.<ref>''Weapon X'' #26</ref>\n\nWhen the War of the Programs started, Jackson and his troop went into hiding.<ref>''Weapon X'' #28</ref>\n\n==Other versions==\n\n===Days of Future Now===\nAn elderly Brent Jackson appears in ''Wolverine: Days of Future Now''.<ref>''Wolverine: Days of Future Now'' #1</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Weapon Plus}}\n{{Wolverine}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Jackson, Brent}}\n[[Category:Fictional secret agents and spies]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics martial artists]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 2001]]\n[[Category:S.H.I.E.L.D. agents]]"}]}}}}
