He guided and progressed many technological revolutions throughout the course of human history, but fell into a state of dejection when he realized that the tools he introduced to humanity were used in August 1945 to create the [[Fat Man|first atom bomb]] which resulted in monumental loss of human life. Blaming himself, he grew distant from his fellow Eternals. In the present day, Phastos settled and started a family with his husband Ben and they raised a son named Jack. He met again with the Eternals to prevent a new wave of Deviants led by [[Kro (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Kro]], and realized their true purpose; to pave the way for the Emergence of Earth, which would lead to the birth of Tiamut and result in the destruction of the planet. The Eternals were divided, with Phastos sidestepping to protect the planet and prevent the Emergence from occurring. By choosing to save the planet and its occupants rather than allow the Emergence to occur, Phastos was abducted from Earth by [[Arishem (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Arishem]] (who plans to observe their memories to see if humanity is worthy enough to live) to places unknown.\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n* [http://www.marveldirectory.com/individuals/p/phastos.htm Phastos] at the Marvel Directory\n* {{comicbookdb|type=character|id=6296|title=Phastos}}\n{{refend}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.marvel.com/universe/Eternals The Eternals] at the Marvel Universe\n* [http://marvel.wikia.com/wiki/Phastos Phastos] at the Marvel Database Project\n\n{{Eternals}}\n\n[[Category:Characters created by Sal Buscema]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1985]]\n[[Category:Eternals (comics)]]\n[[Category:Fictional engineers]]\n[[Category:Fictional hammer fighters]]\n[[Category:Fictional inventors]]\n[[Category:Fictional LGBT characters in film]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters who can move at superhuman speeds]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters who can teleport]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters with accelerated healing]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters with superhuman strength]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics LGBT superheroes]]\n\n{{Marvel-char-stub}}"}]}}}}
