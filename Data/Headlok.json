The character first appeared in ''The West Coast Avengers'' vol. 2 #10 in July 1986.\n\n==Publication history==\nHeadlok first appeared in ''The West Coast Avengers'' vol. 2 #10 (July 1986), and was created by [[Steve Englehart]] and [[Al Milgrom]].\n\nThe character subsequently appears in ''Alpha Flight'' #93-96 (Feb.\u2013May 1991), #102-104 (Nov. 1991-Jan. 1992) and ''Thunderbolts'' #55-58 (Oct. 2001-Jan. 2002).\n\nHeadlok received an entry in the ''[[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Update '89]]'' #3.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nThis mysterious menace found the [[Griffin (Marvel Comics)|Griffin]] roaming the [[Adirondack Mountains]], and used his mental powers to enslave the Griffin. Headlok tricked the [[Avengers (comics)|West Coast Avengers]] by claiming to have spotted [[Thing (comics)|Ben Grimm]] whom the team was looking for. Headlok ambushed them with the Griffin and attempted to take over their minds one by one. The Avenger [[Tigra]] was able to calm the Griffin's rage. It turns out the Thing had indeed been nearby and he joined the battle. Headlok, not knowing this, had not been using his powers to hide himself from sight or mentally influence Ben Grimm and thus was taken by surprise and Headlok was swiftly defeated.<ref>''The West Coast Avengers'' vol. 2 #11</ref>\n\nAlpha Flight and the [[Fantastic Four]] later contended against Headlok.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #93-96</ref> Headlok mentally manipulated [[Aurora (comics)|Aurora]], causing her to revert to her original split personality, and she then apparently killed Headlok.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #102-104</ref> However, he later reappeared as a prisoner, and participated in a prison break.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #55-63</ref>\n\nHeadlok has since been seen working for S.H.I.E.L.D. alongside [[Exodus (comics)|Bennet Du Paris]]. They were brought in to deal with a rogue mutant as part of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s Psi-division. The psychic confrontation appears to have left Headlok dead.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #26</ref> This death is eventually undone when Cyclops' former student, Tempus, goes back in time to erase a rogue mutant's existence.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' vol. 3 #31</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nHeadlok can psionically control or influence the minds of other beings. He can mentally enslave people or alter their perception, such as making them believe he is standing in an area he is not actually in.\n\nSufficient concentration and willpower allows an individual to see through this illusion. If the intended victim knows Headlok plans to use his enslaving ability, his power can be resisted.\n\nMind Control: Headlok possesses the ability to control minds. He can mentally enslave only one individual at a time, as such domination requires a large amount of concentration on Headlok's part. Headlok can induce hallucinations and cast illusions against an unlimited number of targets as long as he has already gained control of their minds. Victims who are aware of Headlok's power were more likely to break his hold.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix5/headloksingleton.htm|Headlok}}\n\n[[Category:Characters created by Al Milgrom]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1986]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics telepaths]]"}]}}}}
