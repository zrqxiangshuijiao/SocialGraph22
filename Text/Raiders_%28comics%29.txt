The trio skirmish with Iron Man for a moment, with one of the Raiders using [[acid]] to damage the hero's armor. During a second battle at a live [[boxing match]], Iron Man defeats all three Raiders. The trio are revealed to be the employees of [[Edwin Cord]], a [[corporate]] rival of [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]] (Iron Man's alter ego). Cord knew that Iron Man, as Stark's [[bodyguard]], would follow him to the trade show, and used this opportunity to demonstrate the capabilities of the Raider suits for covert organisation [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] The character, however, is [[arrested]] by S.H.I.E.L.D agents for his irresponsible actions.\n\nThe Raiders reappear, with upgraded suits, during the [[Armor Wars]] storyline in the title ''Iron Man''. Tony Stark discovers his armor designs have been stolen and decides to retrieve or neutralize the technology, leading to a brief confrontation with the Raiders, in which their suits are rendered [[wikt:Defunct|defunct]].<ref>''Iron Man'' #225 (Jan. 1988)</ref>\n\nThe Raiders were later part of an army of armor-wearing mercenaries hired to attack Stark Enterprises.<ref>''Avengers West Coast'' Annual #7 (1992)</ref>\n\nThe characters reappear in the second volume of ''The Invincible Iron Man'' and confront Iron Man once again.<ref>''The Invincible Iron Man'' vol. 2 #3 (Sep. 2008)</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nEach of the Raider suits provide the wearer with greater durability and [[flight]], and offer varying weapons systems. \"Raider 1\" is equipped with wristbands that can generate [[bullet]]s; [[acid]] and [[laser]]s; \"Raider 2\" is equipped with a [[net (device)|net]] capable of [[syphon]]ing energy and a protective shield that absorbs energy attacks and \"Raider 3\" has two wrist weapons that project and amplify [[sonic wave]]s in concentrated form.\n\n==Other media==\n===Television===\n* The Raiders were set to appear in ''[[Iron Man: Armored Adventures]]'', had the show gotten a third season.\n\n===Film===\n* The Raiders make an appearance in the [[anime]] film ''[[Iron Man: Rise of Technovore]]'', as thugs hired by [[Ezekiel Stane]] and [[Sasha Hammer]].
