Armed with technology supplied by the villainous [[New Gods]] of the planet [[Apokolips]], they are potent foes who can seriously challenge the world's most powerful [[superhero]]es.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Greenberger |first1=Robert |last2=Pasko |first2=Martin |title=The Essential Superman Encyclopedia |date=2010 |publisher=Del Rey |isbn=978-0-345-50108-0 |pages=129\u2013130}}</ref>\n\nIntergang appears in the [[DC Extended Universe]] film ''[[Black Adam (film)|Black Adam]]'' (2022).\n\n==Publication history==\nIntergang first appeared in ''[[Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen (comic)|Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen]]'' #133 (October 1970) and was created by [[Jack Kirby]].<ref name=Guide>{{cite book |last1=Cowsill |first1=Alan |last2=Irvine |first2=Alex |last3=Korte |first3=Steve |last4=Manning |first4=Matt |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |last6=Wilson |first6=Sven |title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia: The Definitive Guide to the Characters of the DC Universe |date=2016 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-5357-0 |page=154}}</ref>  Members of Intergang were first shown in the first issue of Kirby's ''[[Forever People]]'' in 1971.<ref name=SB>{{citation |title=The Supervillain Book: The Evil Side of Comics and Hollywood |editor1=Gina Ren\u00e9e Misiroglu |editor2=Michael Eury |publisher=Visible Ink Press |year=2006 |isbn=9780780809772}}</ref><ref>{{citation |title=The Krypton Companion |editor=Michael Eury |publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing |year=2006 |isbn=9781893905610}}</ref>\n\n==Fictional organization history==\n===Pre-''Crisis''===\nIntergang was founded in the 1920s by a gangster, [[Moxie Mannheim|Moxie \"Boss\" Mannheim]], who was later killed by rivals.{{r|SB}} It was then revived by [[Morgan Edge]] and run by Boss Moxie's son, [[Bruno Mannheim|Bruno \"Ugly\" Mannheim]], as revealed in ''Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen'' #139.{{r|SB}} Bruno was, however, getting orders and weaponry from [[Darkseid]], who was using Intergang to help track down the [[Anti-Life Equation]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Greenberger |first1=Robert |title=The Essential Batman Encyclopedia |date=2008 |publisher=Del Rey |isbn=9780345501066 |pages=139\u2013140}}</ref>\n\n[[Morgan Edge]] was the head of the [[Galaxy Communications (comics)|Galaxy Broadcasting System]] [[television]] network (which had recently purchased the ''[[Daily Planet]]'' and had Clark Kent transferred to its Metropolis affiliate WGBS-TV as its [[anchorman]]). It was later revealed that this was not the real Morgan Edge, but a [[cloning|clone]] from the \"Evil Factory\". When the clone could not bring itself to kill the original Edge at the order of Darkseid, the real Edge was imprisoned. The original Edge would later escape with the help of Jimmy Olsen. During an ensuing battle with Intergang, the clone was mistaken for the original by Intergang hitman Tombstone Gear and incinerated. The real Edge was soon free to resume his role as Galaxy's president.\n\nFollowing the clone's death, different Intergang members had to run Intergang in Edge's absence. Joe Danton was the first to run Intergang and he was later killed by a car bomb.<ref name=\"Superman's Pal, Jimmy Olsen #23\">''Superman's Pal, Jimmy Olsen'' #23. DC Comics.</ref> Then Max Danner became the new Intergang leader.<ref name=\"Superman #296\">''Superman'' #296. DC Comics.</ref> He led Intergang in some criminal activities until he got apprehended. Clark Kent appeared as a key witness until he had to briefly leave to rescue Mr. Xavier. The outcome of the trial was not shown.<ref>''Superman'' #297-299. DC Comics.</ref> When Intergang was dissolved, SKULL took over their territories. When a SKULL assassin was sent after Intergang crime boss Samuel Simeon, he was saved by Superman, though he was later busted by Superman trying to start a new mob outside of Metropolis.<ref name=\"Superman #301\">''Superman'' #301. DC Comics.</ref>\n\n===Post-''Crisis''===\n[[Image:Vincent Edge.jpg|thumb|left|Vincent Edge as seen in ''The Adventures of Superman'' #500.]]\nIn the Post-[[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Crisis]] [[DC Universe]], Morgan Edge was the leader of Intergang, until he suffered a heart attack due to stress. While he believed he was working for Darkseid, his Apokoliptian contact was actually [[DeSaad]], whose only aim in supplying him with weaponry was to cause suffering. While he was in the hospital his legitimate businesses were taken over by his father [[Vincent Edge]], and Intergang was taken over by Bruno \"Ugly\" Mannheim, who trained on Apokolips with [[Granny Goodness]]. A later [[retcon]] has it that Mannheim was the original leader of Intergang, dealing knowingly with DeSaad. How Edge took over is unrevealed.\n\nEventually, Intergang was brought down by Clark Kent and [[Cat Grant]], Mannheim was arrested, but managed to escape. He attempted to disappear through a \"Boom Tube\" (a New Gods transporter), but it collapsed when he was halfway through.\n\nSome time later, Mannheim's father \"Boss\" Moxie Mannheim, a gangster who had been in prison since the 1940s after being captured by the [[Newsboy Legion]], was released. Discovering that the Newsboys were, seemingly, the same age as when he first fought them, he determined to find out how such a thing could be. Meeting renegade [[Project Cadmus]] geneticist [[Dabney Donovan]], he arranged for himself and his former gang members from the 1940s to be cloned into youthful bodies with superpowers. This led to his henchmen Ginny \"Torcher\" McGee, Mike \"Machine\" Gun, Noose, and Rough House being cloned and receiving superpowers. Using Vincent Edge to arrange a meeting between Metropolis' gang-leaders, he killed them all and declared himself the new head of Intergang. The new Intergang spent much of their time tracking down [[Jimmy Olsen]], whom Moxie believed knew Superman's [[secret identity]].<ref>''Guardians of Metropolis'' #1. DC Comics.</ref> <ref>''The Adventures of Superman'' #544. DC Comics.</ref>\n\nFollowing a short-lived attempt by Morgan Edge to regain control, [[Lex Luthor]] gained control of Intergang, retaining Moxie as a figurehead.<ref>''The Adventures of Superman'' #552. DC Comics.</ref> Moxie and his remaining lieutenants were later captured by Superman. When last seen, Intergang was run by a criminal cyberneticist named Frank Sixty.<ref>''Action Comics'' #758. DC Comics.</ref>\n\nIntergang is later seen in Metropolis robbing a bank during the [[Justice League]]'s absence, only to be stopped and beaten by the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].<ref>''JLA/Avengers'' #1. DC Comics/Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n===Infinite Crisis===\nThere was some suggestion that Boss Moxie (who was a member of the [[Secret Society of Super Villains]] at the time) was slain during the [[miniseries]] ''[[Infinite Crisis]]''. The suggestion comes from a sequence during the Battle of Metropolisuring which [[Superboy-Prime]] snaps a villain's neck, killing him. In an interview DC editor-in-chief [[Dan DiDio]] confirmed that Boss Moxie did indeed die in ''Infinite Crisis'' #7 by stating that [[Superboy-Prime]] snapped his neck.\n\n===52===\nIn the pages of ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'', Intergang members Noose and Rough House visit Kahndaq and offer Adrianna Tomaz as tribute to [[Black Adam]] in exchange for safe passage for their group's smuggling activity. Both of them are killed by Black Adam.<ref>''52'' #3. DC Comics.</ref>\n\nIn week 9, [[Question (character)|Question]] tells [[Renee Montoya]] that Intergang is preparing for an invasion of [[Gotham City]]. Two weeks later, the pair finally have a confrontation with the two operatives of Intergang in Gotham, Whisper A'Daire and Kyle Abbot, known in the public eye as the manager of ''HSC International Banking'', an holding connected to Intergang itself, and her [[bodyguard]]. In the weeks that follow, the further investigations of Montoya and the Question reveal Intergang to be operating a mining company called Ridge Ferrick in regions such as [[Australia]], and also having expanded into nations such as Oolong Island, Bialya and [[Yemen]], reorganized along quasi-religious lines, complete with a \"holy\" text known variously as the Book of Crime or the [[Crime Bible]], which treats [[Cain and Abel (comics)|Cain]] as a heroic, if not semi-divine, figure for his role according to Judeo-Christian theology in creating the \"most sacred\" crime of murder. It has even been revealed that the original text is bound by the stone with which Cain slew Abel. In issue #25, Bruno Mannheim was revealed as the current head of Intergang, which is also behind the kidnapping of many of the world's \"mad scientists\", in a grand plan to take over America by the end of the year. He shows himself now acting like a cult leader, exalting the power of crime as the dominant order in the 21st century, and now becoming a cannibal, eating anyone he kills who refuses to join Intergang. At the same time, [[Magpie (character)|Magpie]] and [[Ventriloquist (character)|Ventriloquist]] swear their allegiance to Intergang.<ref>''52'' #25. DC Comics.</ref>\n\nBruno \"Ugly\" Mannheim returns as a giant wielding alien technology, claiming that someone other than Darkseid is behind Intergang's current activities.<ref>''Superman'' #654. DC Comics.</ref>\n\n===Gotham Underground===\nIn the storyline ''[[Gotham Underground]]'', Intergang is in a gang war with [[Tobias Whale]].<ref>''Gotham Underground'' #6. DC Comics.</ref> Intergang buys him out and makes Tobias Whale the [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] of [[Kord Enterprises]] which has become a front for Intergang's criminal activities.<ref>''Gotham Underground'' #8. DC Comics.</ref>\n\n===The New 52===\nIn 2011, \"[[The New 52]]\" rebooted the DC universe. Gotham City has fallen to Intergang's Religion of Crime branch.<ref>''Batwoman'' (vol. 2) #0. DC Comics.</ref> During a gunfight between his gang and the police, Mister Untouchable claimed that Intergang has cut him out of the action occurring in Metropolis by selling the location of their meth laboratory to the law enforcement.<ref>''Resurrection Man'' (vol. 2) #7. DC Comics</ref>\n\nAttackers from Intergang ambush Lois Lane and [[Superboy (Jon Kent)|Jon Kent]] when she was driving him home from school. They run Lois' car off the road and into the woods. While Jon knocks out one of the attackers, Lois contacts Superman who defeats the attackers. Later at their barn, Lois and Clark figure out that their attackers are from Intergang and had followed Lois from her meeting with Cora Benning suspecting that she is \"Author X\".<ref>''Superman: Lois and Clark'' #2. DC Comics.</ref> Bruno Mannheim was informed by two of his men that the attack on \"Author X\" has failed. He throws the two men into the swimming pool and electrifies it.<ref>''Superman: Lois and Clark'' #3. DC Comics.</ref> Lois and Jon later visit Cora Benning's office and find a note stating that she was taken by Intergang. While leaving the office, the three of them encounter Bruno Mannheim in the hall who claims that he is asking for directions. Lois thinks to herself that Mannheim is trying to get her to lower her guard.<ref>''Superman: Lois and Clark'' #4. DC Comics.</ref> When Lois goes to pick up Jon from school and finds him in the library, they are ambushed by Intergang agents who then trap them in a tool closet which they set on fire. Jon's superpowers manifest as he manages to break down the door.<ref>''Superman: Lois and Clark'' #6. DC Comics.</ref> When Jon gets Lois out of the burning tool closet, they are then surrounded by Intergang thugs. Breaking off his fight with Blackrock, Superman manages to save Lois and Jon as the Intergang thugs are caught in the explosion.<ref>''Superman: Lois and Clark'' #7.
