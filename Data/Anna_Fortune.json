Anna Fortune first appeared in ''[[JSA All-Stars]]'' #5 (June 2010) and was created by [[Lilah Sturges]] and [[Freddie Williams II]].\n\n==Publication history==\nAnna Fortune first appeared in ''JSA All-Stars'' #5 in 2010.\n\n===Creation and concept===\n[[Newsarama]] held an interview with Lilah Sturges, the writer of ''JSA All-Stars'', to discuss the series. One of the questions asked was whether Anna would be seen more. Sturges replied: \"Yes. We'll definitely be seeing more of Anna Fortune. I won't say that she's officially a member of the team, but she'll be around, and we'll learn more about her. And her last name is no accident. If there's [[Amos Fortune (comics)|another character in the DCU named Fortune]], but probably in a different way than you might expect\".<ref>[http://www.newsarama.com/comics/JSA-All-Stars-Interview-100517.html JSA ALL-STARS Brings Love, Sorrow, & Action to Young Heroes] By Vaneta Rogers. Posted: 18 May 2010 03:23 pm ET</ref>\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nWhile the [[JSA All-Stars]] were struggling in a battle against the King of Tears, a powerful beast summoned by [[Johnny Sorrow]], Anna Fortune instantly appeared in the scene after leaving her boyfriend \"Wildcat\" at home and took out a gauntlet and trapped the King of Tears in it. She soon revealed to the team that [[Doctor Fate#Kent V. Nelson|Dr. Fate]] sent her to help the team, saying that he once helped her \"out of a jam\". She then instantly began to calibrate a spell that would transport everyone to the Subtle Realms, which is where an All-Star teammate, [[Courtney Whitmore|Stargirl]], was trapped.<ref>''JSA All-Stars'' #5 (June 2010)</ref>\n\nOnce she cast the spell, chaos ensued as they were brought to the Subtle Realms and when she admitted she got the spell wrong and accidentally released the King of Tears. Anna could not undo her mistake, but helped fight alongside the All-Stars against the King of Tears until Stargirl managed to kill the King of Tears by stabbing it in its heart. When the team returned to their base, Anna joined the team.<ref>''JSA All-Stars'' #6 (July 2010)</ref>\n\nWhile going on a mission to Parador, [[Albert Rothstein|Atom Smasher]] asked Anna what her story was and about her connection with Dr. Fate. Anna did not reveal what her story was, and once again stated that Dr. Fate got her out of a jam. She also mentioned that \"the only flying machines they have in my day are hot air balloons\", suggesting she comes from the past, most likely the 19th or very early 20th century.<ref>''JSA All-Stars'' #8 (September 2010)</ref> Following this mission, she had a flirting conversation with Atom Smasher, in which she told him she was \"either twenty-six or a hundred and eighty-seven\", suggesting her home time period is 1849.<ref>''JSA All-Stars'' #11</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nAnna Fortune has displayed an intermediate skill with magic. She has knowledge of multiple spells, though she isn't always adept at casting them. Some of her more successful demonstrated abilities include flight and healing. Often, she will use the launcher mounted on her gauntlet to fire special cartridges she calls \"[[spell (paranormal)|spell]][[Cartridge (firearms)|casings]]\". These are can-sized, bullet-like projectiles with magical contents.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Anna_Fortune_(New_Earth) Anna Fortune at DC Wikia]\n*[http://www.comicvine.com/anna-fortune/29-70385/ Anna Fortune at Comic Vine]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Fortune, Anna}}\n[[Category:DC Comics superheroes]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 2010]]\n[[Category:DC Comics characters who use magic]]\n[[Category:DC Comics characters who can teleport]] \n[[Category:Fictional characters with healing abilities]]"}]}}}}
