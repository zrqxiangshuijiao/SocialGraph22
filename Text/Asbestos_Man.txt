However, it is Asbestos Man who ultimately wins, having created a flame-resistant armor out of \"super-[[asbestos]]\" (a combination of iron, calcium and [[chrysotile]]), rendering Storm's powers useless. Asbestos Man decides to spare the Torch, having already made a mockery of him. Asbestos Man's triumph over the Torch becomes big news. Blackie Barker, otherwise known as the \"King of the Underworld\", becomes aware of the villain and ropes him in to help carry out a bank heist. A humiliated Human Torch returns to settle scores with Asbestos Man, after being encouraged by his fellow [[Fantastic Four]] members. At the bank, the Human Torch absorbs all oxygen present.
