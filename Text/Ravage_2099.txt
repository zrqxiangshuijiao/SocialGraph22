Ravage's first full appearance was in ''Ravage 2099'' #1, which was released alongside other Marvel 2099 universe titles ''[[Spider-Man 2099]]'', ''[[Doom 2099]]'', and ''[[Punisher 2099]]''.<ref name=regrettable>{{cite book |last1=Morris |first1=Jon |title=The League of Regrettable Superheroes: Half Baked Heroes from Comic Book History |date=2015 |publisher=Quirk Books |location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania |isbn=978-1-59474-763-2 |pages=232\u2013233}}</ref>  Unlike the other titles, Ravage was original, not a [[Re-imagining#Reimagining|re-imagined]] version of an existing character. The series ran for 33 issues.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n'''Paul-Phillip Ravage''' was the CEO of ECO, a subsidiary of Alchemax that worked to combat polluters. Ravage's life changed when he was framed for murder in response to questioning the secrets of the company and the violent, often fatal, methods it used. A fugitive armed with a blaster, a [[gear|cog]] used as a [[shuriken]], and a [[kevlar]] vest, Ravage was the target of both the police and Alchemax. On the lam, Ravage's companions were an orphaned boy named Dack, son of a man his company killed, and an Asian-American woman named Tiana who was originally his secretary. Ravage was targeted for elimination by Anderthorp Henton, and battled a mutroid and ECO security.<ref>''Ravage 2099'' #1</ref> Alongside Dack and Tiana, he battled Alchemax troops.<ref>''Ravage 2099'' #2</ref> As a fugitive, Ravage would find himself traveling from civilization to Hellrock, home of [[radiation poisoning|irradiated]] and mutated outcasts, to become the mutated hero of the [[Barrio]] \u2014 an impoverished community of superhero worshipers located on the outskirts of the city. The despotic ruler of Hellrock, Lord Dethstryk, who planned to invade the rest of the world and destroy all humans, would eventually become Ravage's nemesis. Ravage freed Tiana from Hellrock, and battled Deathstryk and the mutroids, and became contaminated by radiation from Hellrock.<ref>''Ravage 2099'' #3</ref>\n\nHe battled more mutroids, and was treated by Dr. Ursell. After prolonged exposure to the radiation of Hellrock, Ravage soon developed a new superpower: his hands became radioactive and constantly generated lethal energy. This new power gave Ravage extreme destructive power, but it did not last for very long. Eventually, the radiation devolved his body to a primal beast form, making Ravage far more attuned to the animal world and giving him horn-like protuberances on his head and face; sharp taloned hands and feet; fangs; a long vertical scar on the left side of his face; enhanced senses, strength, and speed; and the ability to regenerate from almost anything. Ravage can also transform back to a human form when necessary.<ref>''Ravage 2099'' #4-5</ref>\n\nAlongside Dack and Tiana, he battled the New Atlanteans,<ref>''Ravage 2099'' #6-7</ref> and then Anderthorp Henton.<ref>''Ravage 2099'' #8</ref> His body was then reverted to bestial form by radiation.<ref>''Ravage 2099'' #9</ref>\n\n[[Image:Ravage2099-28.jpg|thumb|left|100px|Ravage as a man-beast, in ''Ravage 2099'' #28.]]\n\nTiana would later become a version of the Norse entity [[Hel (being)|Hel]],<ref>''Ravage 2099'' #10</ref> given powers by Alchemax as part of a scheme to control or kill vigilante superheroes, such as Ravage himself.<ref>''Ravage 2099'' #11-13</ref> The two would confront each other, but Tiana recognized her friend and kept herself from killing him.<ref>''Ravage 2099'' #15</ref>\n\nLater they both gained new jobs. Ravage a new business style-job, and Tiana destroying old satellites to follow a 'one up, one down' law. The two would temporarily split when Ravage's animal nature caused him to blurt out his opinion of her new powers, specifically that she is wasting them.<ref>''Ravage 2099'' #19</ref>\n\nRavage attempts to control his animal side, but it comes out in various ways. In one instance, he almost transforms in the presence of a business rival. While visiting a zoo full of cloned animals, he roars back at the lions, realizing he is communicating with them about their wild instincts hating their confinement. He comes to accept his animal side better after dealing with an insane hunter and his abused cat-man.<ref>''Ravage 2099'' #21-24</ref>\n\nRavage teams up with a sentient giant bat named Ferra to search out a legendary valley of animal-people. They team up to destroy a reality-manipulating alien, but do not actually find the valley at the time, just a close, other-dimensional copy.<ref>''Ravage 2099'' #25</ref>\n\nRavage eventually returned to Hellrock, along with Ferra and Tiana/Hela.<ref>''Ravage 2099'' #27</ref> There, with the help of Dethstryk's own confidant, the Seeress, Ravage killed Dethstryk and took over Hellrock.<ref>''Ravage 2099'' #28</ref> Ravage (presumably) died after being immersed in liquid [[adamantium]] by [[Doom 2099|Doom]] and sent into space.<ref>''Ravage 2099'' #33</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nRavage gained powers through surgery and being mutated by the radiation of Hellrock, where he battled Deathstryk to free Tiana. Initially, the powers consisted of the ability to fire kinetic bio-energy beams from his hands that were physically taxing on Ravage; however, these powers mutated and Ravage soon became a man-beast. In his new form, Ravage had enhanced strength, speed, senses, durability, and agility, and superhumanly acute senses; in addition to growing horns, fangs, and claws on his hands and feet. Ravage also possessed a healing factor.\n\nRavage formerly wore a vest of unknown 21st century fabric lined with \"ultimate\" Kevlar (experimental blaster-proof fabric), molecular gloves (capable of containing the kinetic energy power of Ravage's hands for up to one hour), and an adjustable opti-lens (enabling long-range telescopic and infra-red sight).\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.marvel.com/universe/Ravage_(2099) Ravage 2099] at Marvel.com\n\n{{Marvel Multiverse}}\n{{Stan Lee}}\n\n[[Category:1992 comics debuts]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Stan Lee]]\n[[Category:Defunct American comics]]\n[[Category:Fictional businesspeople]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters with superhuman senses]]\n[[Category:Marvel 2099 characters]]\n[[Category:Marvel 2099 titles]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics mutates]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters who can move at superhuman speeds]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters with accelerated healing]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters with superhuman strength]]\n[[Category:Vigilante characters in comics]]"}]}}}}
