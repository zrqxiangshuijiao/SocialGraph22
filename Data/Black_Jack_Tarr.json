He is Sir [[Denis Nayland Smith]]'s aide-de-camp, and a powerful gruff giant.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nTarr served with distinction in the British army, and after his discharge from the military, he accepted a position with the [[British Foreign Service]]. Sometime later, he became an agent for the British intelligence agency, [[MI6|MI-6]]. Eventually, he was assigned to the command of Sir Denis Nayland Smith of [[Scotland Yard]].\n\nWhile serving with Smith, Tarr came into contact with [[Shang-Chi]] and the small band of adventurers fighting a covert war against the criminal mastermind [[Zheng Zu|Dr. Fu Manchu]].{{Issue|date=September 2009}} This group includes Leiko Wu and [[Clive Reston]]<ref>''[[Master of Kung Fu (comics)|Giant-Size Master of Kung Fu]]'' #3 (1974)</ref> who would become two of his closest friends.

Tarr was attacked outside the embassy building where Shang-Chi was staying with friends. He escaped inside. Shang-Chi listened to him, learning of Freelance Restorations, then helped him rescue Mandy. The girl was safely spirited away and the cult's headquarters was destroyed without loss of any life. Unfortunately Mandy had been well brainwashed by the cult at this time and promises to kill Tarr. {{Issue|date=September 2009}}\n\nMandy is taken to Stormhaven Castle where several of Smith's colleagues attempt to bring her back to normalcy. This doesn't go as well, until an attack by the destructive villain Agent Syn. Tarr risks his life to save Mandy from Syn's fire.

However, keeping MI-13 in the dark ''led'' to the Martian invasion and Tarr & Reston have to help [[Pete Wisdom]] to stop it.{{Issue|date=September 2009}}\n\n===''Marvel NOW!''===\nTarr has been promoted as the director of MI-6.
