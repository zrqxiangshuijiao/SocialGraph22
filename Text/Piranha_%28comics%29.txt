The character first appeared in ''[[Namor|Sub-Mariner]]'' #70 (May 1974).<ref>{{cite book |last =Rovin |first =Jeff |title =The Encyclopedia of Supervillains |publisher =Facts on File |date =1987 |location =New York |isbn = 0-8160-1356-X |page=266}}</ref>\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nThe Piranha was created as a result of the experiments of Dr. [[Lemuel Dorcas]], having been exposed to remaining radiation from Dorcas's previous work. After devouring Dorcas's deceased assistants and evolving from a normal fish into a humanoid fish, he ordered other fish into the radiation, creating more Men-Fish. Piranha and his Men-Fish traveled to [[Hydro-Base]] in the hopes of researching more of Dorcas' work there. They followed [[Namor]] and attacked him. During the fight, Piranha was wounded, and his blood attracted his piranhas, which turned on him and devoured him.<ref>''Sub-Mariner'' #71 (May, 1974)</ref>\n\nThese piranhas who ate the original Piranha evolved into identical versions of the original, eventually numbering in the hundreds. They later captured Namor and the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]], forcing them to fight to the death. The two combatants instead managed to crush the underwater stadium they fought in and crushed all the Piranhas.<ref>''Marvel Two-In-One'' #28 (June, 1977)</ref>\n\nThe original Piranha eventually regenerated, and joined the [[Deep Six (Marvel Comics)|Deep Six]] alongside Nagala, [[Orka (comics)|Orka]], [[Sea Urchin (comics)|Sea Urchin]], and [[Tiger Shark (Marvel Comics)|Tiger Shark]] while [[Attuma]] had seized the throne of [[Atlantis (Marvel Comics)|Atlantis]]. Deep Six defended Attuma's throne from the invading Prince Namor and the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]] twice, but lost to the Defenders the second time.<ref>''Defenders'' vol. 2 #7 (September, 2001)</ref>\n\nAfter ''[[Marvel Zombies 3]]'', the zombie [[Deadpool]]'s head was teleported to the bottom of the ocean along with the [[Zombie (comics)|Zombie]] (Simon Garth). The Deadpool head infected Piranha and all of the Men-Fish with the zombie plague. When the Men-Fish attacked a cruise ship, the new [[Midnight Sons]] arrived and destroyed them. As the Midnight Sons explored the ship, the now zombified Piranha attacked them.<ref>''Marvel Zombies 4'' #1</ref> [[Daimon Hellstrom]] causes the ship to explode, destroying all the Men-Fish. Piranha's fate is not shown.<ref>''Marvel Zombies 4'' #2</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nThe Piranha was a normal piranha fish mutated by radiation into a semi-humanoid being with sub-human intelligence. The Piranha had superhuman physicality, teeth that were strong and sharp enough to penetrate Namor's skin,<ref>''Sub-Mariner'' #71 (May, 1974)</ref> claws that were equally as incisive made deadlier by a sleep-inducing venom they generated and the power to command other fish telepathically.<ref>''Marvel Two-In-One'' #28 (June, 1977)</ref> Piranha could increase its intellect by consuming the remains of anyone it came across, effectively adding their knowledge, memories and acumen to its own. The creature also boasts a regenerative healing factor powerful enough to physically restore him even from being devoured by his own Men-Fish,<ref>''Defenders'' vol. 2 #7 (September, 2001)</ref> but was not powerful enough to prevent his reanimation. After being zombified by a necrolized Headpool, Piranha was turned into a zombie with a greatly augmented appetite. On top of the standard ability to spread the zombie plague via physical contact; e.i. biting and scratching as he'd done with his piranha men-fish.<ref>''Marvel Zombies 4'' #1</ref> Piranha gained a parasitic ability to breed and birth schools of zombie men-fish clones of itself as eggs in healthy human hosts, as well as self-spawn without the need of a mating cycle.<ref>''Marvel Zombies 4'' #2</ref>     \n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/piranha.htm|Piranha}}\n\n{{Namor}}\n{{Midnight Sons}}\n[[Category:Characters created by George Tuska]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Marv Wolfman]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1974]]\n[[Category:Fictional fish]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters who can move at superhuman speeds]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters with accelerated healing]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters with superhuman strength]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics telepaths]]"}]}}}}
