They travel to [[Stuttgart]], where Barton steals [[iridium]] needed to stabilize the Tesseract's power while Loki causes a distraction. Loki allows himself to be captured and taken to the S.H.I.E.L.D. [[Features of the Marvel Cinematic Universe#Helicarriers|Helicarrier]], which Barton attacks with other mind controlled agents. Aboard the Helicarrier, Barton fights Romanoff, who knocks him out, breaking Loki's control. Romanoff helps him recover. After Steve Rogers recruits him, Barton becomes a founding member of the Avengers with Rogers, Romanoff, [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark]], [[Bruce Banner (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Bruce Banner]], and Thor. He participates in the Battle of New York against the alien army of the [[Chitauri (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Chitauri]]. Barton later witnesses Loki's defeat and afterwards, he and Romanoff drive off together.\n\n===Ultron and the Sokovia Accords===\n{{see|Avengers: Age of Ultron|Captain America: Civil War}}\nIn 2015, Barton and the Avengers attack a [[Hydra (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Hydra]] facility in [[Features of the Marvel Cinematic Universe#Sokovia|Sokovia]] in an effort to retrieve Loki's scepter. However, Barton is seriously injured by [[Pietro Maximoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Pietro Maximoff]] and a Hydra weapon, but is healed by Dr. [[Helen Cho]] at the [[Features of the Marvel Cinematic Universe#Avengers Tower|Avengers Tower]].

In [[Johannesburg]], Barton and the Avengers track Ultron and try to stop him, but all, except Barton, are enthralled by [[Wanda Maximoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Wanda Maximoff]]'s mind warping technique. Barton takes the defeated Avengers to his safe house where it is revealed that he has a pregnant wife named Laura and children named Cooper and Lila. There, Fury arrives and motivates the team to assemble and stop Ultron.\n\nBarton, Romanoff, and Rogers travel to [[Seoul]] to stop Ultron from uploading his network into a [[Vibranium (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|vibranium]] body powered by the Mind Stone. They succeed, and Barton transports the sentient body back to the Avengers Tower. He also tracks a captured Romanoff's signal in Sokovia. After [[Vision (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Vision]] is awakened, the Avengers return to Sokovia to stop Ultron. There, Barton reunites with Romanoff, participates in the battle against Ultron, convinces Wanda to become an Avenger, and is saved by Pietro who sacrifices his life to shield Barton and a Sokovian child from gunfire. After the battle, Barton goes into retirement and returns home, where he and Laura name their newborn son Nathaniel Pietro Barton, in honor of Romanoff and Pietro.\n\nIn 2016, Barton returns from retirement to help Rogers in his opposition to [[United Nations]] control of the Avengers via the [[Features of the Marvel Cinematic Universe#Sokovia Accords|Sokovia Accords]]. He goes to the Avengers Compound to retrieve Maximoff, but is confronted by Vision, until Maximoff incapacitates him. Barton and Maximoff recruit [[Scott Lang (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Scott Lang]] and travel to the [[Leipzig/Halle airport]] in Germany to join Rogers, Wilson, and [[Bucky Barnes (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Bucky Barnes]]. However, they are intercepted by Stark's team consisting of Rhodes, Romanoff, [[Peter Parker (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Peter Parker]], [[T'Challa (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|T'Challa]], and Vision. After Rogers and Barnes escape, Barton is among those captured and imprisoned in [[Features of the Marvel Cinematic Universe#Raft|the Raft]]. When Stark visits the facility, Barton openly berates him. Later, Rogers breaks him, Lang, Wilson, and Maximoff out, and he and Lang negotiate deals with the U.S. government in accordance with the accords to receive a term of [[house arrest]] instead.\n\n===Ronin and the Time Heist===\n{{see|Avengers: Endgame}}\nIn 2018, Barton, still on house arrest, enjoys a picnic with his family, but is caught off-guard when Laura, Lila, Cooper, and Nathaniel suddenly [[The Blip|vanish]]. In his grief, Barton becomes a vigilante called Ronin. He dons a [[ninja]] costume and [[katana]] and begins to hunt down and eliminate organized crime around the world, killing criminals he believes deserved to die instead of innocents like his family. In New York, he attacks the [[Tracksuit Mafia]] and murders many of its members, including [[William Lopez (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|William Lopez]], making enemies like the Tracksuit Mafia leader [[Wilson Fisk (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Wilson Fisk]] and Lopez's daughter [[Maya Lopez (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Maya]]. At some point, he travels to [[Mexico]] and slaughters a [[drug cartel]]. Rhodes attempts to track him down but is unsuccessful.\n\nIn 2023, Barton travels to [[Tokyo]] and murders the [[Yakuza]], before being approached by Romanoff, who tells him that the Avengers discovered [[time travel]] to reverse the Blip. Barton returns to the Avengers Compound and reunites with the other Avengers, as well as meeting [[Rocket (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Rocket]] and [[Nebula (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Nebula]]. Barton volunteers to test out the quantum tunnel and is transported into the [[Quantum Realm]] where he travels to an alternate timeline seeing his house and hearing his daughter's voice before being transported back. After the Avengers formulate a plan to retrieve the Infinity Stones from different points in time, Barton and Romanoff travel to an alternate 2014 timeline.\n\nTravelling in the ''Benatar'' through space, they land on the planet [[Vormir (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Vormir]] and are met by the [[Red Skull (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Red Skull]], who tells them that in order to retrieve the [[Soul Stone]], a life sacrifice is required. Barton chooses to sacrifice himself, but is stopped by Romanoff. They fight to sacrifice themselves but, in the end, Romanoff jumps over the cliff, allowing Barton to obtain the Soul Stone. After returning to the main timeline, a grief-stricken Barton and the original Avengers hold a mourning for Romanoff outside of the Compound. Once the Nano Gauntlet is constructed, Barton watches as Banner uses it to reverse the Blip. Barton receives a phone call from his restored wife. However, the Compound is then attacked by missiles sent by an alternate Thanos' ''Sanctuary II'' warship and Barton falls into the Compound's tunnels below. Barton recovers the Gauntlet and protects it against [[Outriders (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Outriders]], before joining the [[Battle of Earth (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|battle]] against the aliens. Barton watches Stark sacrifice himself to destroy Thanos' army and, after the battle, returns home and reunites with his family. A week later, they all attend Stark's funeral at his cabin and afterwards, Barton reunites with Maximoff.\n\n=== Meeting Kate Bishop ===\n{{See also|Hawkeye (2021 TV series)}}\n{{Further|Never Meet Your Heroes|Hide and Seek (Hawkeye)|Echoes (Hawkeye)|l2=Hide and Seek|l3=Echoes}}\nOne year later, Barton, now wearing a [[hearing aid]], spends time with his children in New York City for [[Christmas]], attending a [[Broadway theatre]] musical about Steve Rogers and the Avengers. Barton leaves early due to being bothered by the portrayal of the Battle of New York and reminders of Romanoff. That night, he learns from local news that someone has acquired his Ronin suit and is fighting the Tracksuit Mafia while wearing it. After rescuing the disguised individual from the Mafia, he unmasks the individual and finds out it is a young woman named [[Kate Bishop (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Kate Bishop]], a skilled archer who grew up idolizing him after he unknowingly saved her during the Battle of New York.\n\nBishop takes Barton back to her apartment, but they are attacked by the Mafia and forced to leave the Ronin suit behind as they evacuate with [[Lucky the Pizza Dog|Lucky]], a one-eyed [[golden retriever]] that Bishop rescued and adopted earlier. After relocating to Bishop's aunt's apartment, Barton sends his children back home the next morning, promising to return by Christmas Day. He escorts Bishop to her work and then recovers the Ronin suit from a [[Live action role-playing game|LARP]] event in [[Central Park]]. Later, Barton allows himself to be captured by the Mafia to learn more about their plans. Bishop, unaware of this, tracks down Barton's location to rescue him and gets captured in the process. [[Maya Lopez (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Maya Lopez]] interrogates him on Ronin's true identity and Barton tells her that Ronin was killed by Romanoff. After managing to free himself and Bishop, the two work together to battle and evade Lopez and the Mafia at the [[Manhattan Bridge]].\n\n==== Investigating the Tracksuit Mafia ====\n{{Further|Hawkeye (2021 TV series)#Episodes{{!}}Echoes|Partners, Am I Right?}}\nBarton, accompanied by Bishop and Lucky, obtains a new hearing aid and then goes to the penthouse of Bishop's mother, Eleanor, to learn more about the Tracksuits using her mother's company's database. However, Bishop gets locked out of her mother's account, and Barton is confronted by [[Jack Duquesne]], the fianc\u00e9 of Bishop's mother who possesses Barton's Ronin sword. The situation is diffused after Eleanor and Duquesne recognize him. Eleanor asks him to keep Bishop out of his investigation as he secretly takes back his sword. With the help of his wife Laura, Barton discovers that Duquesne is the CEO of Sloan Limited, a [[shell company]] that [[money laundering|launders money]] for the Tracksuits. That night, Bishop throws him and Lucky a small Christmas party to make up for missing time with his family, and the two bond over various activities. Barton tells Bishop about his past with Romanoff as she deduces that he was Ronin.\n\nThe next day, Barton locates Lopez's lieutenant, Kazi Kazimierczak, and demands he convince Lopez to end her vendetta against Ronin. Afterwards, Laura informs Barton that a [[Rolex]] watch recovered from the Avengers Compound stolen by the Tracksuits is sending out tracking signals from an apartment building. Barton and Bishop go to retrieve it, and ultimately find the watch in Lopez's apartment, where she also keeps notes on Barton and his family. As Bishop battles Lopez, Barton is ambushed by a masked assassin who is revealed to be [[Yelena Belova (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Yelena Belova]], who is targeting him after learning of his involvement in Romanoff's death,{{efn|name=Black Widow|As depicted in ''[[Black Widow (2021 film)|Black Widow]]'' (2021).}} before she escapes. Barton decides that he cannot keep putting Bishop in danger and breaks off their partnership.\n\n====Hunted by Lopez and Belova====\n{{Further|Ronin (Hawkeye episode)|So This Is Christmas?|l1=Ronin}}\nBarton takes shelter at the apartment of his new friend, [[FDNY]] firefighter Grills. He visits the local Avengers memorial and speaks to the late Romanoff, apologizing aloud for what he is about to do. Barton sets a meeting with Lopez where he dons the Ronin suit, quickly incapacitates all of her men, and fights and defeats Lopez. He spares her life and unmasks, warning her that continued threats toward his family will result in her demise, and reveals that he was tipped off by an [[informant]] working for Lopez's boss who wanted her father dead. Lopez manages to injure Barton who is subsequently saved by Bishop and Lopez flees. Bishop reveals to Barton that Belova is hunting him. Belova sends Bishop a text message informing her that her mother is working with Lopez's boss, who Barton identifies as organized crime boss [[Wilson Fisk (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Wilson Fisk]].\n\nBarton watches a video Belova sent Bishop and learns that Eleanor killed Armand and set up Dusquense to take the fall. On Christmas Eve, Barton and Bishop attend Eleanor\u2019s holiday party at [[Rockefeller Center]]. Kazi attempts to assassinate Eleanor on Fisk's order, but later targets Barton. Barton enlists the help of Grills and the LARPers to evacuate the party guests, then later rejoins Bishop and defeats the Tracksuit Mafia. Bishop later departs to look for Eleanor, while Barton is confronted by Belova, who demands the truth of Romanoff's death. Barton complies but the struggle leads to a fight in which Barton eventually convinces Belova to stand down and spare his life. In the aftermath, Eleanor is arrested by the police for Armand's murder, while Fisk manages to escape but is later shot by Lopez. On Christmas Day, Barton departs New York in a car with Bishop and Lucky. Once home, he introduces Bishop and Lucky to his family, witnesses his children opening their presents, returns the stolen watch, a S.H.I.E.L.D. memento, to his wife Laura, and later burns the Ronin suit with Bishop.\n\n==Alternate versions==\n{{See also|What If...?

Afterward, they head to the [[Hydra Siberian Facility]] and locate the final copy of [[Arnim Zola (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Arnim Zola]]'s mind, which they hope to upload onto Ultron's hive mind and eliminate him. This plan backfires as Ultron was not in their universe, prompting Barton to sacrifice himself to the pursuing Ultron sentries for Romanoff and Zola to escape.\n\n==Characterization==\n[[File:Jeremy Renner by Gage Skidmore.jpg|170px|left|thumb|Jeremy Renner on the ''[[Hawkeye (2021 TV series)|Hawkeye]]'' panel at San Diego Comic-Con in 2019.]]\nA master archer working as an agent for S.H.I.E.L.D.<ref name=\"Renner\">{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-renner-idUSTRE65310E20100604|title=Jeremy Jeremy Renner near deal to join Marvel's 'Avengers{{'-}}|last1=Kit|first1=Borys|last2=Kit|first2=Zorianna|date=June 4, 2010 |work=Reuters|access-date=July 27, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220220145223/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-renner-idUSTRE65310E20100604|archive-date=February 20, 2022 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"ABCNews\">{{cite web|author=Corinne Heller|url=http://www.ontheredcarpet.com/Joss-Whedon-talks-The-Avengers:-Jeremy-Renner-confirmed-as-Hawkeye-Exclusive/7782821|title=Joss Whedon talks 'The Avengers': Jeremy Renner also confirmed as 'Hawkeye' (Exclusive)|date=July 23, 2010|publisher=[[ABC News|On The Red Carpet]]|access-date=July 24, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110185510/http://www.ontheredcarpet.com/Joss-Whedon-talks-The-Avengers:-Jeremy-Renner-confirmed-as-Hawkeye-Exclusive/7782821 |archive-date=November 10, 2013 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Renner said it was a very physical role and that he trained physically and practiced archery as much as possible in preparation.<ref name=\"WSJ\">{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/BL-SEB-47594|title=Jeremy Renner on 'The Town,' 'The Avengers' and the New 'Mission: Impossible{{'-}}|last=Farley|first=Christopher John|date=September 17, 2010|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|access-date=May 29, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220324000733/https://www.wsj.com/articles/BL-SEB-47594|archive-date=March 24, 2022|url-status=live}}</ref> About the role, Renner said, \"When I saw ''Iron Man'', I thought that was a really kick-ass approach to superheroes.

Hawkeye's allies initially believe he's taken up the Ronin identity again, but Clint convinces them otherwise when he fights Ronin in person and attends a F.E.A.S.T. charity gala that he donated to around the same time Ronin fought Hood's men and [[Spider-Man]]. Hood's tech support Bryce Bandau is able to deduce that Clint is Ronin. Clint takes Bryce to his apartment and reveals he pulled off being in two places at once with a small time machine that sent him forward in time for one hour. He uses Hood's money to hire Bryce as his own tech support and to keep him silent for his activities as Ronin while enacting social change as Hawkeye. Since the time machine broke during his fight with Spider-Man, Clint steals a robotic replica of himself from S.H.I.E.L.D. and hires a Skrull to impersonate him to keep up the ruse.<ref>''Hawkeye: Freefall'' #1-3.

Clint puts on his classic Hawkeye costume and steals Hood's bounty money to prevent the other criminals from interfering in his battle with Parker. He defeats Hood by robbing Parker of his powers with Count Nefaria's help.

He has gained a reputation for being able to \"turn any object into a weapon\", and has been seen using items such as tin plates, coins, sticks, and other debris to great effect against his enemies.\n\nHawkeye is also known to use a \"Sky-Cycle\" as his mode of transportation. The Sky-Cycle is modeled after a commercial snowmobile and is fitted with anti-gravitational technology. It is voice-operated and has an auto-pilot steering system. The original Sky-Cycle was custom-made for Hawkeye by Jorge Latham while employed by Cross Technological Enterprises.<ref name=\"Hawkeye1\"/> Latham was later employed by the [[West Coast Avengers]] and built several more.<ref>''The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Deluxe Edition'' #1</ref>\n\n==Supporting characters==\n{{Main|List of Hawkeye characters}}\n\n==Other versions==\n===Age of Apocalypse===\nIn the ''[[Age of Apocalypse]]'' timeline, Hawkeye moved to [[Europe]] and was a pilot for the Human High Council, piloting [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]] when he went to collect Don Blake after a mission in [[Wakanda]].{{issue|date=September 2020}}\n\n===Amalgam Comics===\nAttributes of Hawkeye and the [[DC Comics]] archer [[Green Arrow]] were combined into two new characters in the [[Amalgam Comics]] universe. Hawkeye is Clint Archer, who developed extraordinary archery skills through ardent study at a monastery in Tibet and earned membership in the Judgment League Avengers. His mask and costume colors are from Green Arrow, and his Tibetan monastery origins are similar to that of the [[Connor Hawke]] version.{{issue|date=September 2020}}\n\nOliver Queen in the Amalgam universe is Goliath (Clint's second superhero identity), who developed a growth serum with [[Hank Pym]]. The two of them are also in a love triangle with Dinah Barton, alias Canary, a fellow Judgment League Avenger. Canary is a combination of DC Comics' [[Black Canary]] and Marvel's Mockingbird, the respective love interests of the two archers in their main universes.<ref>''JLX'' #1</ref>\n\n===All-New Hawkeye===\nIn ''All-New Hawkeye'', Clint and Kate give up Project Communion (Inhuman orphans with powerful and dangerous psyonic abilities) to Hydra after failing to protect them. An alternate future is shown where Clint and Kate split up for twenty years. An older Clint has retired from heroics and just spends time with his new dog, Lucky 2, until the middle aged Kate arrives and forces Clint to help with a mission. Kate at this point has made an entire organization stemmed from the Hawkeye name, and is generally recognized as the Hawkeye by other heroes and villains due to Clint's absence. She and Clint attempt to rescue the Project Communion children from the Mandarin and Maria Hill while utilizing Kate's connections to other superheroes like Marvel Boy and Captain America Chavez. However, Hill has them cornered and kills one of the subjects, leading them to regret splitting up twenty years ago. This future was averted in the main story as they successfully rescued the children in the past. The older Hawkeye still uses hearing aids, and objects to Kate's suggestion of wearing Pym-Plants due to his experience with Ultron.<ref>''All-New Hawkeye (series)''</ref>\n\n====Earth-13584====\nOn Earth-13584, Hawkeye appears as a member of Spider-Man's gang.<ref>''Dark Avengers'' #187. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n===Warp World===\nDuring the events of \"[[Infinity Wars]],\" [[Gamora]] used the Infinity Stones to fold the universe in half, resulting in the creation of Warp World, where characters and histories were merged. Hawkeye merged with [[Patsy Walker|Hellcat]] to become '''Cat's Eye''', who became partners with the Green Widow (an amalgamation of Black Widow and She-Hulk).<ref>''Infinity Wars: Infinity Warps'' #1</ref>\n\n===Marvel Mangaverse===\nHawkeye appears as a member of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]. He is said to be an expert marksman and wears some sort of design collaboration between his new costume and his Ultimate incarnation. When [[Doctor Doom]] attacked an international conference Doom kills Hawkeye off panel and he is seen with half of his body obliterated. [[Captain America]] and [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|the Vision]] were also killed.{{issue|date=September 2020}}\n\n===Marvel Zombies===\nIn ''[[Marvel Zombies]]'' Hawkeye was one of the first heroes zombified by [[Sentry (Robert Reynolds)|Sentry]], and goes on a rampage with the other zombified Avengers. During the fight against [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]], he manages to hit him with an arrow, but Magneto severs Clint's head with Colonel America's shield. 40 years later his head is discovered by [[T'Challa]]'s grandson and given the Wasp's robotic body as it appears his hunger has diminished. He is killed by a rampaging Hulk and given a funeral with the other fallen heroes.<ref>''Marvel Zombies (series)''</ref>\n\n===MC2===\nIn the [[Marvel Comics 2|MC2 universe]], Hawkeye is retired due to his blindness, but he continues to serve as a combat trainer for new heroes.<ref>''Last Hero Standing'' #2</ref>\n\n===Old Man Logan===\nSet fifty years in the future, an old and blind Hawkeye hires [[Old Man Logan|Logan]] to help him deliver a secret package to New Babylon (formerly [[Washington D.C.]]). He's had three ex-wives, the third of which was [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]]'s youngest daughter Tonya. He had a daughter with her named [[Spider-Bitch (Ashley Barton)|Ashley]]; after learning that Ashley has been captured by the [[Kingpin (character)#Old Man Logan|Kingpin]] after attempting to overthrow him as a new [[Spider-Woman]], alongside a new [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)#Old Man Logan|Daredevil]] and [[Punisher#Old Man Logan|Punisher]], Clint convinces Logan to take a detour with him to rescue her. However, upon doing so, Ashley immediately decapitates the Kingpin and reveals that she too is a [[supervillain]], known as [[Spider-Bitch (Ashley Barton)|Spider-Bitch]], having had herself captured and lured her father there to allow her the opportunity to take over as the new Kingpin. After Ashley subsequently attempts to kill him, Clint is rescued by Logan and they resume their quest, briefly lamenting his failed relationship with Ashley while drinking at a bar. As it turns out, Clint was delivering a batch of Super Soldier Serums to a supposed underground league planning to form a group similar to the Avengers, but it turns out it was a set-up by the [[Red Skull#Old Man Logan|Red Skull]], which results in Clint's death.<ref>[[Wolverine (comic book)#Volume 3|''Wolverine'' vol. 3 #66\u201371]] \u2013 \"[[Old Man Logan]]\"</ref>\n\nThis version of Hawkeye received his own miniseries titled ''Old Man Hawkeye'', which explores Hawkeye's life five years before the events of ''Old Man Logan'' as he is losing his vision and decides to use what remains of his eyesight to hunt down the Thunderbolts and Baron Zemo in revenge for their aligning with the Red Skull to kill the other Avengers. In this effort, he is aided by Kate Bishop and hunted by Marshall Bullseye.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Anderson|first1=Jenna|title='Old Man Hawkeye' Prequel Comic Coming From Marvel|url=http://comicbook.com/marvel/2017/10/01/marvel-comics-old-man-hawkeye-prequel-series-old-man-logan/|website=comicbook.com|access-date=1 October 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Earth-398===\nIn one Avengers storyline titled \"Queen's Vengeance,\" Morgan Le Fay caused a reality distortion wave that set the time period in a medieval setting and the Avengers to be brainwashed into an elite guard known as the Queen's Vengeance, who protected Morgan. Hawkeye was renamed Longbow and his design is an amalgam of his classic costume and a medieval hooded, bearded archer (bearing a strong resemblance to [[Robin Hood]]). He was the second Avenger to break free from the illusion with interference from the first one, Captain America, who ambushed Clint because Clint's strong feelings towards the Avengers was enough to break him free from Morgan's curse.<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 3 #2</ref>\n\nWarbow was later seen with [[Peggy Carter#Captain Carter|Captain Carter]] and War Widow when they find [[Moon Knight#Earth-818|Moon Knight]] and [[Vision (Marvel Comics)#Earth-818|Vision]] at the Center of Infinity and recruit them into Avenger Prime's army.<ref>''Avengers: Forever'' Vol. 2 #4</ref>\n\n===Secret Wars===\nThere had been different Hawkeyes seen during the \"[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]\" storyline:\n\n* In ''[[Amazing Spider-Man: Renew Your Vows]],'' Hawkeye is the leader of the resistance in S.H.I.E.L.D. to stop [[Regent (comics)|Regent]]'s rule. He was one of the few survivors of Regent's onslaught, but lost his eye in the process (giving him two similarities with Nick Fury). He has a grudge against [[Spider-Man]] for not choosing to aid the Avengers in their time of need as Spider-Man was more concerned with saving his family. In the final battle against Regent, he tries shooting an arrow at Regent with an inhibitor chip to disable most of his powers but Regent inherited Peter's Spider Sense and stopped it. He gave the arrowhead to Annie Parker before she went to save her father, and thanked the Parker family as he and the rest of the heroes arrested Regent.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man: Renew Your Vows'' #1-4</ref>\n* In the ''Secret Wars'' version of ''[[House of M]]'', Hawkeye is one of the remaining humans that is being hunted down by the mutants and Sentinels with [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]] and [[Misty Knight]]. They attempt to assassinate [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|King Magnus]] and Hawkeye uses a specialized arrow to disrupt Magnus' magnetic powers. However they are forced to work with Magnus when Quicksilver and Namor take over the throne, and despite Magnus reclaiming his powers and title, he chooses to spare the resistance for their help.<ref>''House of M'' vol. 2.</ref>\n* In ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'', Clint is now the new version of [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]] and is on Captain America's side. He is part of Peter Parker's strike team to obtain something for [[Beast (comics)|Beast]]'s machine, and defeats King Ock (a brain-dead [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]] who killed [[Doctor Octopus]] and stole his tentacles) using the club of the deceased Elektra.<ref>''Secret Wars: Civil War'' #3</ref>\n* A [[Marvel 2099|2099]] version of Hawkeye appears as part of Alchemax's Avengers team in ''Secret Wars 2099''. His name is Max and his DNA was mixed with a hawk giving him claws and wings.<ref>''Secret Wars 2099'' #1</ref>\n\n===Ultimate Marvel===\n{{Main|Ultimates}}\nThe [[Ultimate Marvel]] imprint title the ''[[Ultimates]]'' features a version of Hawkeye who uses a cover story of being a former [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] archer to hide his conviction of an unexplained murder charge when he was recruited by [[Ultimate Nick Fury|Nick Fury]] into the Ultimates program, a government sponsored program made up of humans with extraordinary abilities and super-human operatives. During his time with the Ultimates, most, if not all, of his missions were of the Black Ops variety in which he partnered with the [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)#Ultimate Marvel|Black Widow]], who turned out to be a traitor to the group and killed Barton's wife and children.{{issue|date=September 2020}}\n\nSeeking revenge, Hawkeye tracked down the Black Widow, passing herself off as a wounded civilian after the invasion, and executed her.<ref>''The Ultimates 2'' #6</ref> As addressed in \"Ultimates 3\", it was shown that the events during the invasion left him brooding and emotionally devastated, seeming almost to have a \"death wish\", and his brash, morally ambiguous and borderline sadomasochistic behavior became even more of an issue.{{issue|date=September 2020}}\n\nWhile Hawkeye is traditionally just a normal human trained to a high level of skill, Ultimate Hawkeye was altered via some type of experimental optical surgery. His superhuman accuracy also extends beyond archery, to anything he can throw like 616 [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]], to the extent that he once escapes captivity by pulling out his own fingernails to use as weapons. Whether or not his teammates know of his augmentations is unknown, with the exception of Nick Fury, who has confirmed his knowledge, but it would appear that, in Hawkeye's favor, they remain unaware of his full abilities.<ref>[[Mark Millar]] (w), [[Bryan Hitch]] (p), ''The Ultimates'' #7 (Sept. 2002), [[New York, NY]]: [[Marvel Comics]]</ref> It has also been remarked that before the \"Ultimate Hawkeye\" miniseries, he claimed to need to wear corrective goggles to see properly, but it appears that that too may have been a ruse.{{issue|date=September 2020}}\n\n===What if? Dark Reign===\nIn ''[[What If (comics)#Volume 9|What if? Dark Reign]]'' #1, Clint Barton succeeds in killing [[Norman Osborn]]. The superhero community then hunts him down for his crimes, while the public and the government turn completely against superheroes. While Mockingbird gives him what he needs to escape, he ends up being shot and killed by a mentally unstable man who wants to prove a point against superheroes, leaving Victoria Hand completely in charge of H.A.M.M.E.R.<ref>''What if? Dark Reign'' #1</ref>\n\n===X-Men Forever===\nHawkeye was a member of the Avengers when they went after the X-Men in response to accusations that they had been involved in the deaths of Tony Stark and Beast, nearly being killed by Sabretooth before Shadowcat convinced him to spare the archer. He subsequently witnessed the destruction of Avengers Mansion and the apparent death of the Avengers.<ref>''X-Men Forever: Giant-Size Annual'' #1</ref>\n\n==In other media==\n===Television===\n* Clint Barton / Hawkeye appeared in ''[[The Marvel Super Heroes]]'', voiced by [[Chris Wiggins]].<ref>''The Marvel Super Heroes on TV!
