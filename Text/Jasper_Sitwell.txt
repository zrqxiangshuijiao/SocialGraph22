He became the S.H.I.E.L.D. liaison to [[defense industry]] contractor [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]] beginning in the \"Iron Man\" feature in ''[[Tales of Suspense]]'' #93 (September 1967), and continuing into that subsequent series as well. He was seldom featured from the early 1970s until the 1988 miniseries ''[[Nick Fury vs. S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'', and then again in the 1996\u20131997 series ''Iron Man'' (vol. 2). Sitwell afterward appeared in a three-issue arc of the [[superhero]]-team series ''[[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]]'' in 2000, and in ''[[Punisher War Journal]]'' (vol. 2) #1 (January 2007).\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nJasper Sitwell graduated at the top of his class at S.H.I.E.L.D. Academy, with particularly high marks in airborne jump school and underwater maneuvers. When first introduced to S.H.I.E.L.D. Executive Director [[Nick Fury]], the new agent's eager-beaver attitude meets initially with mock (and occasionally real) frustration from Fury and second-in-command [[Dum Dum Dugan]], but Sitwell soon proves himself and earns his fellow agents' respect &mdash; albeit tinged with occasional humor aimed at his youthfulness and idealistic na\u00efvet\u00e9. Mentored by Fury himself and occasionally appointed interim director when Fury is on solo missions in the field, Sitwell later is assigned to [[Stark Industries]] as liaison between S.H.I.E.L.D. and that defense-industry contractor, which designs and manufactures much of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s ordnance and equipment.<ref>''[[Tales of Suspense]]'' #95.

Sitwell is eventually reassigned back to S.H.I.E.L.D.,{{issue|date=June 2012}} but continues to play a role in the affairs of Tony Stark from time to time. When [[Iron Monger|Obadiah Stane]] takes over what was by then named Stark International, Fury sends Sitwell on an ultimately failed attempt to retrieve the [[Iron Man's armor|Iron Man armors]].<ref>''[[Iron Man]]'' #174. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nSitwell, like most of the S.H.I.E.L.D. leadership at the time, is seemingly killed by a self-aware, renegade \"Deltan\" variety of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s [[Android (robot)|artificial human]] \"[[Life Model Decoy]]s\", and replaced by one such LMD, which was then installed as executive director.<ref>''Nick Fury vs. S.H.I.E.L.D.'' (1988)</ref> The real Sitwell later turns up alive after having been [[brainwash]]ed by a faction of the terrorist organization [[HYDRA (comics)|HYDRA]], placed in [[suspended animation]], released as part of a plot against Fury, and eventually [[deprogram]]med.<ref>''Nick Fury: Agent of SHIELD'' (vol. 2) #45. Marvel Comics.</ref> He has since become S.H.I.E.L.D.'s top interrogator, often paired with fellow agent [[Jimmy Woo]].<ref>''[[Secret War: From the Files of Nick Fury]]''</ref> He has also worked closely with [[G. W. Bridge]], mainly in an attempt to neutralize the threat of the [[Punisher]].<ref>''[[Punisher War Journal]]'' (vol. 2) #1 (January 2007). Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nSitwell was one of the many S.H.I.E.L.D. agents who refused to join [[Norman Osborn]]'s [[H.A.M.M.E.R.]] organization in the wake of the [[Skrull]] [[Secret Invasion]]. He would join with Dum Dum Dugan to form a [[Howling Commandos|mercenary paramilitary group]] that would engage H.A.M.M.E.R., HYDRA and its associate \"Leviathan\" program, alongside Nick Fury's [[Secret Warriors (Team White)|Secret Warriors]].<ref name=SW17>''[[Secret Warriors (2009 series)|Secret Warriors]]'' #17 (2010).

Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nDuring one of the Winter Soldier's missions, a brainwashed [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]] is brought into custody at S.H.I.E.L.D. headquarters. She had been influenced by old Russian brainwashing technology so it seemed she had broken free of one brainwashing attempt and had returned to her old self. This was actually a ruse by rogue Russian elements in order to strike at Nick Fury. Black Widow tried to kill Nick Fury but Sitwell got on the trajectory of the shot and was killed instead of Fury. His sacrifice gave Fury the opportunity to save himself.<ref name=WS09>''Winter Soldier'' #9-10 (2012).

After the defeat of Teen Abomination, Jasper was brought back to his cell. On the way back to his cell, he crossed Dugan and recognized him.<ref>''S.H.I.E.L.D.''
