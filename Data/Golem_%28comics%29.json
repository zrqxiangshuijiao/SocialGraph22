He recruited the [[Constrictor (comics)|Constrictor]], [[Shocker (comics)|Shocker]] and [[Jack O'Lantern (Marvel Comics)|Jack O'Lantern]] to help protect a batch of \"bloodstones\". After the [[Hood (comics)|Hood]] arrived and stole half the diamonds, he gave Madam Rapier a list of pawn shops for them to scout, in case Hood tried to sell them. Hood arrived at the Golem's office and asking for a cut of the diamonds if he returned the rest undamaged. Golem agreed, but after the Hood left, told Rapier to kill the thief at their rendezvous.{{issue|date=November 2011}}\n\nAfter the Hood double-crossed Rapier, knowing she planned to double-cross him, she was killed in a hail of police gunfire.
