The first Outlaw named Nigel Higgins is England's version of Punisher that first appeared in ''Punisher'' (vol. 2) #64 and was created by [[Dan Abnett]], [[Andy Lanning]], and [[Douglas Braithwaite]]. The second Outlaw named Inez Temple was created by [[Gail Simone]] for the series ''[[Deadpool (comic book)|Deadpool]]'' and ''[[Agent X (Marvel Comics)|Agent X]]''. She is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] with the ability of superhuman strength and an uncanny aptitude with [[firearm]]s.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n===Nigel Higgins===\n{{Infobox comics character|<!--Wikipedia:WikiProject Comics-->\n|image=\n|caption=\n|character_name=Outlaw\n|real_name=Nigel Higgins\n|species=[[Human]]\n|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]\n|debut=''[[Punisher]]'' (vol. 2) #64 (June 1992)\n|creators=[[Dan Abnett]]<br>[[Andy Lanning]]<br>[[Douglas Braithwaite]]\n|alliances=Champions of Europe\n|aliases=\n|powers=Use of firearms\n}}\n'''Nigel Higgins''' is a man living in [[England]] who gets inspired by [[Punisher]]'s activities that causes him to become the British version of Punisher called Outlaw. At the time when [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]] planned to use the English channel to gather the European crime families into a united crime syndicate, Outlaw was the main contact for Punisher and [[Microchip (comics)|Microchip]].<ref>''Punisher'' (vol. 2) #64\u201370</ref>\n\nDuring the \"Suicide Run\" crossover, Outlaw hears about Punisher's death and heads to the [[United States of America]] to investigate. When Punisher was found to be alive in the small town of Laastekist, Outlaw got mixed in with every copycat, ally, and villain that were converging on the location.<ref>''Punisher'' (vol. 2) #86\u201388</ref>\n\nAs part of the \"[[All-New, All-Different Marvel]]\" brand, Outlaw has left the vigilante business upon regretting if he should let bad guys live or not.<ref name=\"Contest of Champions #10\">''Contest of Champions'' (vol. 3) #10</ref> Upon moving to New Yorkshire, Outlaw assumed the alias of \"Neil Hibbs.\" His normal life was short-lived when he is chosen by [[Collector (comics)|Collector]] to partake in the \"Contest of Champions\" against his will at the Battlerealm.<ref>''Contest of Champions'' (vol. 3) #1</ref> As part of Collector's team, Outlaw survived every battle. When Collector's right-hand man [[Maestro (comics)|Maestro]] of Earth-69413 betrays Collector and takes the Iso-Sphere, Outlaw witnesses this action as Maestro becomes the new ruler of a reassembled [[Battleworld]].<ref>''Contest of Champions'' (vol. 3) #6</ref> Outlaw and the other contestants were defeated by Maestro as the two-presumed dead contestants [[Stick (comics)|Stick]] and [[Sentry (Robert Reynolds)|Sentry]] of Earth-1611 appeared to cut Maestro's victory short. Upon getting hold of the Iso-Sphere, Outlaw used its powers to have Maestro contained somewhere, the other contestants to return to whichever place they want, and for the Iso-Sphere to shatter. Upon returning to England with the Earth-616 contestants, Outlaw had also wished for those he had killed to be returned to life. Outlaw then returned to the superhero business where he helps those in need instead of punishing the guilty.<ref name=\"Contest of Champions #10\"/>\n\nDuring the ''[[Secret Empire (comics)|Secret Empire]]'' storyline, Outlaw appears as a member of the Champions of Europe. The group, alongside [[Squirrel Girl]] and [[Pod (comics)|Enigma]], successfully drives off the violent [[Hydra (Marvel Comics)|Hydra]] forces that had tried to claim [[Paris, France]].<ref>''U.S.Avengers'' #7\u20139 (2017)</ref>\n\n===Inez Temple===\n{{Infobox comics character|<!--Wikipedia:WikiProject Comics-->\n|image=[[File:Agent X 02 Udon Studios.jpg|250px]]\n|caption=Cover art for ''Agent X'' #2.<br>Art by [[Alvin Lee (comic book artist)|Alvin Lee]].\n|character_name=Outlaw\n|real_name=Inez Temple\n|species=[[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|Human Mutant]]\n|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]\n|debut=''[[Deadpool (comic book)|Deadpool]]'' #65 (May 2002)\n|creators=[[Gail Simone]]\n|alliances=[[Agency X]]<br>[[The 198]]\n|aliases=Crazy Inez\n|powers=Minimal superhuman strength<br>Enhanced resistance to injury<br>Healing factor<br>Use of firearms and a lasso\n}}\nInez Temple was born in [[Texas]] and as a child she was bullied by other children, who called her ''Crazy Inez''. This nickname still enrages Inez. Due to her [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] strength, she was far stronger than her peers and beat them whenever they bullied her, but her father taught her to be responsible with her powers. She is a descendant of Lance Temple, who was also known as the Wild West gunman [[The Outlaw Kid]].<ref>''The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z'' vol. 9</ref><ref>''Deadpool Rank and Foul''</ref>\n\nWhen she grew up, she became a [[mercenary]], covering her hair with a long, blonde wig and even had breast augmentation surgery.<ref>''[[Agent X (Marvel Comics)|Agent X]]'' #2 (October 2002)</ref> She encountered [[Deadpool]] several times and flirted with him,{{issue|date=January 2013}} but the two never really got a chance to hit it off. Outlaw was called in as a shooting instructor for [[Agent X (Marvel Comics)|Alex Hayden]] aka Agent X. They were both hired shortly afterwards to steal the Punisher's Colt .45 handguns and despite being competitors, they started a romantic relationship. They failed to steal the Punisher's guns and were locked up in a phone booth minus their weapons and clothes by Castle. The Punisher then killed the people who had sent them.{{issue|date=January 2013}} After that Outlaw started to work with Agent X.{{issue|date=January 2013}} When Alex announced his plans to set up a special agency for mercenaries, known as Agency X, she had to disappoint him though; her father had taken ill and she went back to Texas to be with him.{{issue|date=January 2013}}\n\nShe returned after her father died and discovered that in her absence Alex had had an affair with his secretary [[Sandi Brandenberg]].{{issue|date=January 2013}} Her rage vanished when she saw that Alex was being attacked by the [[Black Swan (comics)|Black Swan]]. Black Swan called Outlaw \"Crazy Inez\" and in a fit of rage, Outlaw punched straight through his torso. This wasn't enough to kill Black Swan though and together with [[Taskmaster (comics)|Taskmaster]] and Sandi, they defeated the Black Swan. Outlaw and Alex continued their relationship (as did Sandi and Taskmaster).{{issue|date=January 2013}} She aided Alex Hayden with his mercenary company, Agency X,{{issue|date=January 2013}} but with the end of the ''Agent X'' series, she disappeared from the limelight.\n\nAfter [[Decimation (comics)|Decimation]], she was one of the few mutants to retain her powers.{{issue|date=January 2013}} Heeding [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]]'s call for [[sanctuary]], Outlaw went to the [[X-Mansion]] for protection and ran into [[Peepers (Marvel Comics)|Peepers]] along the way who was on the run from the Sapien League and battling their leader, the [[Leper Queen]].{{issue|date=January 2013}} She becomes one of the 198, and was bunking with [[Magma (comics)|Magma]] and [[Skids (comics)|Skids]].{{issue|date=January 2013}} She struck a rather friendly relationship with Magma; listening when Magma complains about [[Empath (comics)|Empath]] always following her and never leaving her alone even in her dreams.{{issue|date=January 2013}}\n\nWhen a group of superheroes known as the New Warriors accidentally blow up a town causing the general public to turn on superheroes and eventually ignite a [[Civil War (comics)|superhero civil war]].{{issue|date=January 2013}} Domino, Shatterstar and Caliban break out the 198 and take them to a bunker in the middle of the desert.{{issue|date=January 2013}} They get sealed inside with nuclear weapons and are activated for self-detonation. Outside the X-Men get involved with a fight against Bishop and the O*N*E and Domino wants to help them. Lorelei Travis notices that Cyclops is being controlled by Johnny Dee and recounts the story of the first few days at the 198 encampment. Outlaw is then used by Johnny Dee along with other mutants to attack Domino and Shatterstar. After holding Domino at gunpoint, Toad snaps her out of it. They are all freed from the bunker by combined X-Men, Avengers and military forces. Outlaw takes a leadership role throughout the crisis.<ref>''X-Men: Civil War'' #1\u20134 (2006)</ref>\n\nOutlaw was later kidnapped, bound and gagged along with [[Sandi Brandenberg]] by [[T-Ray (comics)|T-Ray]], one of Deadpool's nemeses.{{issue|date=January 2013}} Deadpool swiftly rescued them, seemingly killing T-Ray by skewering his head with his sword.{{issue|date=January 2013}} The two were reunited with a now-obese Agent X, after being experimented on by [[Hydra (comics)|HYDRA]],{{issue|date=January 2013}} and ended up under Deadpool's employ after being tentatively appointed head of Agency X by Hayden.{{issue|date=January 2013}} Outlaw and Sandi then joined [[Weasel (Marvel Comics)|Weasel]] to help bring Deadpool and Bob: Agent of HYDRA back to the present day, after Weasel accidentally transported the two to World War II.{{issue|date=January 2013}} After they were restored, the two stayed with the [[Fantastic Four]], allegedly to play cards.{{issue|date=January 2013}}\n\nAfter being critically wounded from a fight with the Punisher, Deadpool comes to Outlaw for assistance. She reveals that she and Agent X are no longer in a relationship.<ref>''Deadpool: Suicide Kings'' #2</ref> Deadpool later returns and remodels her house after it is destroyed during a fight with the Punisher. She then sleeps with Deadpool after seeing that he actually cares for her.<ref>''Deadpool: Suicide Kings'' #5</ref>\n\nRecently Outlaw has been seen on the mutant island of Utopia. During Second Coming, after the dome is set and the Nimrods arrive, Cyclops gathers mutants, including Inez, and delivers a speech saying that it's everyone's time to fight, today they are all combatants, today they are all X-Men.<ref>''New Mutants'' (vol. 4) #14</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nThe Nigel Higgins version of Outlaw has exceptional skills with firearms.\n\nThe Inez Temple version of Outlaw has some degree of superhuman strength, the exact limits of which aren't known. However, she can punch through brick walls with ease. The tissues of her body are somewhat more resistant to physical injury than that of an ordinary human. However, she is far from invulnerable and can be injured by weapons composed of conventional materials or with sufficient force, much like an ordinary human. Nonetheless she can withstand high caliber bullets without them penetrating, though she isn't totally impervious to them. In at least one instance after being shot with .45 caliber bullet from a moderate distance, Inez sustained no more injury other than some bruises. If injured, Outlaw is capable of healing herself somewhat faster from minor injuries than an ordinary human. Apart from her mutant powers, Outlaw has exceptional skills with firearms and with a lasso.\n\n==Alternate versions==\n===Deadpool Pulp===\nIn re-imagining of Deadpool set during the McCarthy era, the Inez Temple version of Outlaw is a fugitive from the United States after she is accused of stealing atomic bomb equipment.<ref>''Deadpool Pulp'' #1\u20134 (November 2010\u2013February 2011)</ref>\n\n===Deadpool MAX===\nIn this version, Outlaw is an insane asylum patient with dissociative multiple personality disorder with whom Deadpool has a brief relationship. She first poses as a psychiatrist to lure Deadpool there in order to extract his organs for illegal donations at the behest of a hospital doctor, but develops feelings for him and helps him escape.<ref>''Deadpool MAX'' #2</ref> Later on, she reappears as [[Domino (comics)|Domino]], asking Deadpool to elope with her as she reveals to be pregnant with his baby;<ref>''Deadpool MAX'' #6</ref> however, the pregnancy is soon revealed to be fake and, through the trust of a Deadpool in denial, she assumes an appearance similar to [[Black Widow (comics)|Black Widow]] under the name \"Honey Moon\", in which Deadpool has her committed to the asylum again.<ref>''Deadpool MAX'' #7</ref> She is seen later still as a Mrs. Claus-styled dominatrix called \"Santa Clawz\", with delusions of wanting to destroy Christmas by giving guns to children and forcing other inmates to make the weapons; only all they can do is draw guns on papers, and Deadpool and Bob quickly talk her down again.<ref>''Deadpool MAX X-Mas Special''</ref> Her \"Outlaw\" persona only appears in flashbacks told by [[Agent X (Marvel Comics)|Agent X]], another inmate whom she trained and asked to go after Bob and Deadpool for the US$10 million bounty on their heads.<ref>''Deadpool MAX II'' #4</ref>\n\n==In other media==\n===Video games===\n* The Inez Temple version of Outlaw appears as a member of the [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] team that confronts the [[Punisher]] in the final cutscene of the 2009 [[PlayStation Network]] game ''[[The Punisher: No Mercy]]''.<ref>{{cite video game|title = ''[[The Punisher: No Mercy]]''|developer = [[Zen Studios]]|publisher = [[Sony Computer Entertainment]]|date = 2 July 2009|platform = [[PlayStation 3]]|version = 1.0|scene = |level = |quote = }}</ref>\n\n===Film===\n* While not appearing in person, a life-sized cutout of the Inez Temple version of Outlaw is seen in ''[[Deadpool 2]]'', during the scene where Deadpool and Weasel interview the future members of [[X-Force]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20051121081608/http://www.uncannyxmen.net/db/characters/showquestion.asp?fldAuto=1616 Uncannyxmen.net character bio on Outlaw]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060206110926/http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix3/outlawax.htm a more detailed look at Outlaw]\n\n{{Punisher}}\n{{Deadpool}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Outlaw (Comics)}}\n[[Category:Characters created by Andy Lanning]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Dan Abnett]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Gail Simone]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1992]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 2002]]\n[[Category:Fictional Black British people]]\n[[Category:Fictional British people]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from Texas]]\n[[Category:Fictional gunfighters]]\n[[Category:Fictional mercenaries in comics]]\n[[Category:Fictional people from London]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters who can move at superhuman speeds]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters with superhuman strength]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics female superheroes]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics mutants]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics superheroes]]"}]}}}}
