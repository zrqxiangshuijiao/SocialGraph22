He initially was a sort of [[author surrogate]] or [[alter ego]] for writer [[Steve Gerber]], though Gerber is also shown to exist in the Marvel Universe. He was introduced in ''[[Man-Thing]]'' Volume 1, #2, a bit of a loner who rather easily befriended the nearly mindless monster. When in [[rural]] areas, he was frequently belittled for having a college education and a rather [[left-wing]] perspective. Later, under the pen of [[David Anthony Kraft]], he became friends with [[She-Hulk]], with slight romantic overtones that went nowhere.  The character is named after [[Richard Cory]], a nearly opposite character whose song was playing on the radio when Gerber created the character.<ref>letters column, ''Man-Thing'' #6</ref>\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n\nRichard Rory, an eternal [[pessimist]] who claims that he was dropped by the doctor at his birth,<ref>[http://www.photontorpedoes.com/archives/photon/mt-rory2.jpg ''Man-Thing'' #2]</ref> had been a [[disc jockey]] for an [[Ohio]] radio station when he is introduced at age 23. When he made fun of the [[Foolkiller]] on the air, the Foolkiller pursued him all the way to the [[Florida]] [[Everglades]]. There, he punched [[Steve Gerber (comics)|Steve Gerber]] in the face, mistaking him for the Foolkiller because they drove the same model car. Rory survived and the Foolkiller did not, after Rory pounced on him while he was shooting. He befriended [[Ruth Hart (Marvel Comics)|Ruth Hart]], a nurse from [[St. Louis]] who was [[Girlfriend|old lady]] to a biker named Snake. After some time together, in which Rory suggested [[marriage]], she went to [[New York City]] to pursue her nursing career, deciding the gentle but opinionated Rory was not her type. When he met her he mentioned that he could not get any further down, having caused his fianc\u00e9e's mother to have a heart attack by wearing a [[Halloween]] mask on a date.<ref>''Man-Thing'' #2 (Feb 1974)</ref>\n\nRory had several more adventures, most of which were resolved by Man-Thing, whom he had never feared, making an appearance. He also guided [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]] to Ted Sallis's old shack, which was being used by [[Gladiator (Melvin Potter)|Gladiator]] and [[Death-Stalker]].<ref>In ''Daredevil'' #113, he noted it was the site of several recent deaths. A footnote says that this is a reference to ''[[Tales of the Zombie]]'' #6, but as the cabin in that story was only a day's walk from [[New Orleans, Louisiana]], it is clearly a reference to a two-part text story in ''[[Monsters Unleashed (comics)|Monsters Unleashed]]'' #8-9. All stories in question are Gerber's, perhaps implying that the story was published in a different place than originally intended.</ref>\n\nHe decided to remain in [[Citrusville]], the nearest town to Man-Thing's swamp, and got a job at the local radio station. This was short-lived. Speaking out on the air against the Citrusville [[book burning]], Rory gets fired and Josefsen the mad Viking threatens him for being \"less than a man\". Deciding it is time to leave Citrusville for good, he is accompanied, at their insistence, by Man-Thing (now able to leave the swamp for extended periods after being run through Citrusville's sewage treatment plant), and Carol Selby, the daughter of the book burning instigator, Olivia Selby. As Carol is still in high school, he becomes a wanted fugitive, legally a kidnapper, but he cannot conscionably leave her in the madness that is Citrusville. He escapes with them to [[Atlanta]], but is eventually caught and given a prison rap in Citrusville, and Carol returned to her parents.<ref>''Man-Thing'' #20 (Aug 1975)</ref>\n\n[[Tony Stark]] briefly pays Rory a visit, knowing his connection to Man-Thing and seeking information, but his most important visitor is cellmate Greg Salinger, who is in on [[disorderly conduct]] charges. While in the cell together, Rory tells Salinger of his past, including details about the Foolkiller incident.<ref>''Omega the Unknown'' #9 (Aug 1977)</ref>\n\nWhen Rory is released, Ruth Hart allows him to stay in her [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan|Hell's Kitchen]] apartment, where she lives with ''[[Daily Bugle]]'' [[photographer]] Amber Grant and [[James-Michael Starling]], a young [[orphan]] and former patient with a mental link to [[Omega the Unknown]]. Greg Salinger has also come to New York, equipped with the Foolkiller gear Rory never dreamed he would seek for his own use. Searching for James-Michael, he helps the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]] deal with the Foolkiller, initially attempting to get Salinger to join the team, but it does little good, and [[Nighthawk (Marvel Comics)|Kyle Richmond]]'s mansion is burned to the ground by Foolkiller's purification gun when he learns that the team does not kill their foes.<ref>''Defenders'' #75 (Sep 1979)</ref>\n\nOmega the Unknown was killed by [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] police who erroneously believed that his attack on [[Ruby Thursday]] was unprovoked. The Defenders end their adventure with Richard, Dian Wilkins, (Starling's friend), and James-Michael (who does not survive) in Las Vegas, where Rory asks the Defenders to leave him to begin life anew.<ref>''Defenders'' #78 (Feb 1980)</ref>\n\nWhen we next see him, he is still down on his luck, wandering through the streets of Las Vegas. He finds a [[Dollar coin (United States)|silver dollar]] on the ground and decides to use it in the [[slot machine]] of a nearby [[casino]]. He hits the [[Progressive jackpot|jackpot]], and is horrified that no money comes out, assuming it is his constant bad luck. The manager explains to him that a prize that large can be given only in the form of a check. He places the entire amount on a single spin of the roulette wheel at the urging of a showgirl in the employ of the casino manager. Instead of losing, as the casino manager hoped, he wins, breaking the bank.<ref>''The Savage She-Hulk'' #7 (Aug 1980)</ref>\n\nWhile driving his new car, he gets involved in a minor accident with She-Hulk, who changes back into Jennifer Walters in the nearby alley. It does not take him long to realize that they are the same person, but he chooses to withhold that he knows. He decides what he really wants to do with his money is buy the Citrusville radio station that fired him, and Jennifer accompanies him. When She-Hulk shows up in the swamp, where he is briefly reunited with Man-Thing, Rory's suspicion that she is Jennifer is confirmed beyond doubt, but he still does not let on that he knows.<ref>''The Savage She-Hulk'' #8</ref>\n\nOne evening at the station, he believes he has made contact with an alien lifeform, but it turns out to be [[John Jameson (comics)|John Jameson]], the Man-Wolf, whose universe is in peril. A ruby necklace being worn by Jennifer acts as a conduit, as the universe is in fact, trapped inside her bloodstream.<ref>''The Savage She-Hulk'' #13 (Feb 1981)</ref>\n\nAfter this episode, with the radio station trashed, he returns to [[Los Angeles]] with Jennifer, where he becomes rival to her boyfriend, Daniel \"Zapper\" Ridge, in spite of sleeping only on her couch. Only when she walks into her house as She-Hulk with Richard there does he reveal that it is no surprise. At the end of She-Hulk's series, Rory wanders away, alone again, She-Hulk having, for a time, chosen Zapper, even though Rory, at great physical pain, was much more integral in getting Mr. Walters to accept that his daughter is She-Hulk than Zapper was.<ref>''The Savage She-Hulk'' #20; #24-25 (Sep 1981; Jan-Feb 1982)</ref>\n\nWith Zapper and Zapper's rich new wife, Rory showed up for Jennifer's [[Christmas]] [[party]] many years later, once again a wealthy man, this time [[Inheritance|inherit]]ed from an aunt he never knew he had, though with his track record, whether this is to last remains to be seen.<ref>''The Sensational She-Hulk'' #36</ref> It has been pointed out, however, that Gregory Ross Curtis, the new identity of the severely burned third Foolkiller Kurt Gerhardt, bears a striking resemblance to Richard Rory.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/foolk3.htm|title = Foolkiller (Kurt Gerhardt)}}</ref>\n\nHe was also among the group pulled out of time for She Hulk's trial by the [[Time Variance Authority]].<ref>''She-Hulk'' (vol. 2) #3</ref>\n\nIn his most recent appearance, he saves Stu Cicero, a supporting character of She-Hulk, from Man-Thing, but Stu drives off in Rory's [[Volkswagen van]], leaving him in the swamp to avoid his return in the ''She-Hulk'' title.<ref>''She-Hulk'' (vol. 2) #20</ref>\n\n==Notes and references ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Appearances list==\n''in chronological order''\n*''[[Man-Thing]]'' Vol. 1, #2-7 by Steve Gerber\n*''Giant Size Man-Thing'' #1 by Steve Gerber\n*''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]'' Vol. 1, #113-115 by Steve Gerber\n*''Man-Thing'' Vol. 1, #11-12, 17-20 by Steve Gerber (also flashback in #22)\n*''[[Iron Man]] Annual'' #3 by Steve Gerber\n*''[[Omega the Unknown]]'' #8-10 by [[Roger Stern]] (8) and Steve Gerber\n*''[[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]]'' #74-76, 78 by [[Ed Hannigan]] and [[Steven Grant]] \n*''Daredevil'' #140 by [[Bill Mantlo]] (flashback)\n*''[[The Savage She-Hulk]]'' #7, 8, 13-17, 19-22, 24, 25 by [[David Anthony Kraft]]\n*''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #225 by [[Roger Stern]] (flashback)\n*''[[The Sensational She-Hulk]]'' #36 by [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]]\n*''[[She-Hulk]]'' vol. 2 #3 and 20 by [[Dan Slott]]\n==External links==\n*[http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix7/roryrichardmt.htm Richard Rory] at the Appendix to the Marvel Handbook\n\n{{Steve Gerber}}\n{{Man-Thing}}\n{{She-Hulk}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Rory, Richard}}\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics male characters]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Steve Gerber]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Val Mayerik]]"}]}}}}
