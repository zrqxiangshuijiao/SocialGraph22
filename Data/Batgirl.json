Although the character [[Bette Kane|Betty Kane]] was introduced into publication in 1961 by [[Bill Finger]] and [[Sheldon Moldoff]] as Bat-Girl, she was replaced by [[Barbara Gordon]] in 1967, who later came to be identified as the iconic Batgirl.{{cn|date=September 2021}} The character debuted in ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #359 (January 1967) by writer [[Gardner Fox]] and artist [[Carmine Infantino]], introduced as the daughter of police commissioner [[James Gordon (comics)|James Gordon]].\n\nBatgirl operates in [[Gotham City]], allying herself with Batman and the original [[Robin (comics)|Robin]], [[Dick Grayson]], along with other [[List of Batman supporting characters#Bat-Family|masked vigilantes]]. The character appeared regularly in ''Detective Comics'', ''[[Batman Family]]'', and several other books produced by DC until 1988. That year, Barbara Gordon appeared in [[Barbara Kesel]]'s ''Batgirl Special'' #1, in which she retires from crime-fighting. She subsequently appeared in [[Alan Moore]]'s graphic novel ''[[Batman: The Killing Joke]]'' where, in her civilian identity, she is shot by the [[Joker (character)|Joker]] and left [[paraplegia|paraplegic]]. Although she is reimagined as the computer expert and information broker Oracle by editor [[Kim Yale]] and writer [[John Ostrander]] the following year, her paralysis sparked debate about the [[portrayal of women in comics]], particularly violence depicted toward female characters.\n\nIn the 1999 storyline \"[[No Man's Land (comics)|No Man's Land]]\", the character [[Huntress (Helena Bertinelli)|Helena Bertinelli]], known as [[Huntress (comics)|Huntress]], briefly assumes the role of Batgirl until she is stripped of the identity by Batman for violating his stringent codes. Within the same storyline, the character [[Cassandra Cain]] is introduced. Cain is written as the daughter of assassins [[David Cain (comics)|David Cain]] and [[Lady Shiva]] and takes the mantle of Batgirl under the guidance of Batman and Oracle. In 2000, she became the first Batgirl to star in an eponymous monthly comic book series, in addition to becoming one of the most prominent characters of Asian descent to appear in American comics. The series was canceled in 2006, at which point during the company-wide storyline \"[[One Year Later]]\", she is established as a villain and head of the [[League of Assassins]]. After receiving harsh feedback from readership, she is later restored to her original conception. However, the character [[Stephanie Brown (comics)|Stephanie Brown]], originally known as Spoiler and later Robin, succeeds her as Batgirl after Cassandra Cain abandons the role.\n\nStephanie Brown became the featured character of the ''Batgirl'' series from 2009 to 2011, prior to DC's [[The New 52]] relaunch, which established Barbara Gordon recovering from her paralysis following a surgical procedure and starring as the title character of ''Batgirl'' once again. Barbara later returned to the Oracle role with [[Infinite Frontier]] in 2020, and currently operates as both Batgirl and Oracle, with Cassandra and Stephanie also serving as Batgirls. The Barbara Gordon version of Batgirl has been adapted into various media relating to the [[Batman franchise media|Batman franchise]], including television, film, animation, video games, and other merchandise. [[Dan DiDio]], co-publisher of DC Comics, expressed that Barbara is the best-known version of the character.\n\n== Publication history ==\n{{Overly detailed|date=May 2017|section=yes}}\n\n===''Detective Comics'', ''Batman Family'', and other appearances (1961\u20131988)===\n[[File:Batgirl (Barbara Gordon - post-Zero Hour version).png|thumb|upright|Barbara Gordon as Batgirl,<br>art by [[Brian Stelfreeze]]]]\nFollowing the accusations of a homoerotic subtext in the depiction of the relationship between Batman and [[Dick Grayson|Robin]] as described in [[Fredric Wertham]]'s book ''[[Seduction of the Innocent]]'' (1954), a female character, Kathy Kane the [[Batwoman]], appeared in 1956 as a [[love interest]] for Batman.{{sfn|Daniels|2004|p=93}} In 1961, DC Comics introduced a second female character as a love interest for Robin.{{sfn|Daniels|2004|p=93}} Betty Kane as \"Bat-Girl\" arrived as the niece of, and Robin-like sidekick to, Batwoman, first appearing in ''Batman'' #139 (April 1961).<ref>\n{{Cite comic\n|writer=[[Bill Finger]]\n|penciller=[[Sheldon Moldoff]]\n|inker=[[Charles Paris]]\n|story=Bat-Girl!\n|title=[[Batman (comic book)|Batman]]\n|issue=#139\n|date=April 1961\n|publisher=[[DC Comics]]\n|url=http://www.comics.org/issue/16178/#128166\n}}\n</ref> The creation of the [[List of Batman supporting characters#Bat-Family|Batman family]], which included Batman and Batwoman depicted as parents, Robin and Bat-Girl depicted as their children, the [[Extraterrestrials in fiction|extraterrestrial]] [[imp]] [[Bat-Mite]] and the \"family pet\" [[Ace the Bat-Hound]], caused the Batman-related comic books to take \"a wrong turn, switching from superheroes to situational comedy\".{{sfn|Daniels|2004|p=93}}\n\nDC Comics abandoned these characters in 1964 when newly appointed Batman-editor [[Julius Schwartz]] judged them too silly and therefore inappropriate.<ref name=1stBatwoman>{{cite news\n|url=http://www.newsarama.com/dcnew/Batwoman/BatwomanHistory.htm\n|title=Remembering Kathy Kane: The First Batwoman\n|author=Grandinetti, Fred\n|work=Newsarama\n|access-date=2007-09-19\n|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929132840/http://www.newsarama.com/dcnew/Batwoman/BatwomanHistory.htm\n|archive-date=September 29, 2007\n|url-status=dead\n}}</ref> Schwartz had asserted that these characters should be removed, considering the Batman related comic books had steadily declined in sales, and restored the Batman mythology to its original conception of heroic vigilantism.{{sfn|Daniels|2004|p=93}} Bat-Girl, along with other characters in the Batman Family, were [[Retroactive continuity|retcon]]ned out of existence following the 1985 limited series ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]''.<ref>{{Cite comic\n|writer=[[Marv Wolfman]]\n|artist=[[George P\u00e9rez]]\n|title=[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]\n|issue=#1\u201312\n|date=April 1985 \u2013 March 1986\n|publisher=DC Comics\n}}<!--is this in a specific issue or a text piece in a specific collection--></ref> However, even though Bat-Girl did not exist in the Post-''Crisis'' continuity, a modified version of the character, Mary Elizabeth \"Bette\" Kane, introduced as the superhero [[Flamebird]], continues to appear in DC Comics publications.<ref>{{Cite comic\n|writer=George P\u00e9rez\n|artist=Various\n|story=Pieces of the Puzzle\n|title=Secret Origins Annual\n|issue=#3\n|date=1989\n|publisher=DC Comics\n|url=http://www.comics.org/details.lasso?id=45557\n}}</ref>\n\nSchwartz stated that he had been asked to develop a new female character in order to attract a female viewership to the [[Batman (TV series)|''Batman'' television series of the 1960s]].{{sfn|Daniels|2004|p=113, 115}} Executive producer [[William Dozier]] suggested that the new character would be the daughter of Gotham City's Police Commissioner James Gordon, and that she would adopt the identity of Batgirl.<ref name=\"Back38\">{{cite journal|last= Cassell|first= Dewey|date= February 2010|title = Growing Up Gordon: The Early Years of Batgirl|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue= #38|pages= 65\u201370|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}</ref> When Dozier and producer Howie Horowitz saw rough concept artwork of the new Batgirl by artist [[Carmine Infantino]] during a visit to DC offices, they optioned the character in a bid to help sell a third season to the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] television network.

Among them was a cover to ''Batgirl'' #41 by artist [[Rafael Albuquerque (artist)|Rafael Albuquerque]] that took its inspiration from ''The Killing Joke''. The cover depicts the Joker standing next to a tearful Batgirl, who has a red smile painted across her mouth. The Joker has one hand holding a revolver draped over Batgirl's shoulder and is pointing to her cheek with the other hand, as if gesturing to shoot her.\n\nThe cover quickly drew criticism for highlighting a dark period in the character's history, especially when juxtaposed with the youthful, more optimistic direction of the series at the time. The [[hashtag]] #changethecover drew dozens of posts on Twitter and Tumblr asking DC to not release the variant. DC ultimately withdrew the cover from publication at the request of Albuquerque, who stated, \"My intention was never to hurt or upset anyone through my art...For that reason, I have recommended to DC that the variant cover be pulled.\"<ref>Ching, Albert (March 16, 2015).

For the most part, she supports [[Cassandra Cain]] and [[Stephanie Brown (comics)|Stephanie Brown]] to operate as Batgirls, sharing the title.\n\n===Alternative versions===\nVarious alterations of Barbara Gordon as Batgirl have appeared in storylines published in and out of mainstream continuity titles. Variants of the character within continuity often appear in stories which involve time travel, such as the crossover limited series ''[[Zero Hour (comics)|Zero Hour: Crisis in Time]]'', a follow-up story preceded by the 1985 limited series ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' which altered mainstream continuity. Notable imprints of DC Comics such as ''[[Elseworlds]]'' and ''[[All Star DC Comics]]'' have also featured alternate versions of the character.\n\nThe ''Elseworlds'' imprint takes the company's iconic characters and places them in alternate timelines, places and events making heroes \"as familiar as yesterday seem as fresh as tomorrow\".<ref>{{cite book|author=Booker, M.

Betty Kane as \"Bat-Girl\" was depicted as the niece of, and Robin-like sidekick to, the original Batwoman. In 1964, however, editor Julius Schwartz asserted that Bat-Girl and other characters in the Bat-Family should be removed considering the decline in sales and restored the Batman mythology to its original conception of heroic vigilantism. During the ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' storyline, Betty Kane was retconned out of existence.\n \nMary Elizabeth \"Bette\" Kane is a reinvented version of the Betty Kane character during the Silver Age. As her original characterization was retconned out of existence during the ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' storyline, a discrepancy arose where her Bat-Girl character had joined the West Coast version of the Teen Titans, but simply disappeared. The character was reintroduced as Bette Kane and the alias of [[Flamebird]]. Following ''Infinite Crisis'', the character's past as Batgirl was hinted at as being a part of continuity. However, that reference included a revamped origin of the character and it may or may not have been the current Bette Kane.\n\n===Barbara Gordon===\n{{main|Barbara Gordon}}\n[[Image:Batgirls.jpg|thumb|upright|Barbara Gordon and Cassandra Cain as Batgirl, art by Matt Haley and David Hahn]]\nDuring the run of the Batman television series, DC editorial was approached about adding a female character back into the Batman family. Revising the character history and motivation, Julius Schwartz created Barbara Gordon. This character held the role of Batgirl from 1967 to 1988 when she was retired by DC editorial decision. The character's role was changed to a [[paraplegic]] source of information for all members of the Batman family and codenamed the \"Oracle\". She was later restored as Batgirl during ''The New 52'' relaunch of the entire DC publication line in 2011. This was also the case with the DC Rebirth (2016). After the suicide of her psychopathic brother James Gordon Jr., Barbara ponders her role as Batgirl, becomes Oracle and continues to support the Batman family behind the computer screen, with the option to occasionally return to the role of Batgirl. Above all, she takes on the role of mentor for Cassandra Cain and Stephanie Brown, who now share the title of Batgirl.\n\n===Cassandra Cain===\n{{main|Cassandra Cain}}\nDuring the ''[[Batman: No Man's Land|No Man's Land]]'' storyline, Cassandra Cain was given the role of Batgirl under the guidance of Batman and Oracle. Written as the daughter of assassins David Cain and Lady Shiva, she is trained from early childhood to read human body language instead of developing verbal and written communication skills as part of her father's conditioning to mold her into the world's deadliest assassin. However, after committing her first murder, she vows to never again use her martial-arts prowess to kill. In 2000, she became the first Batgirl to star in an eponymous monthly comic book series, as well as one of the most prominent characters of Asian descent to appear in American comics. The series was cancelled in 2006 and Cassandra Cain abandoned the role of Batgirl shortly thereafter. Years later, Cassandra rejoined the Batman family under the moniker the Blackbat. In ''The New 52'', Cassandra reappeared in the comic series ''[[Batman and Robin Eternal]]'' with a slightly different history. Here she is also the murderer of Harper Row's mother, an ally of Batman. She called herself Orphan for a while and became part of the Batman family as well as the Outsiders. She later shares the name Batgirl with her friend Stephanie Brown.\n\n===Stephanie Brown===\n{{main|Stephanie Brown (comics)}}\nStephanie Brown was formerly known as the Spoiler and then as the first in-continuity female Robin until her apparent death in 2006. Following her return to comics in 2009, she assumed the role of Batgirl. She maintained this position until 2011, the relaunch of the DC imprint under ''The New 52''. The character reappeared in the DCU in ''Batman'' (vol. 3) #28, as the Spoiler. Stephanie reappears in the series ''[[Batman Eternal]]'', where she again goes by Spoiler in an attempt to thwart her father's machinations. After ''[[DC Rebirth]]'', she joined Batman's new team of vigilantes where she became the girlfriend of Tim Drake aka Red Robin before they break up. Eventually she shares the title Batgirl with her friend Cassandra Cain.\n\n===Claimants===\n====Helena Bertinelli====\n{{main|Huntress (Helena Bertinelli)}} \nFor a brief time during 1999's ''No Man's Land'' storyline, Helena Bertinelli assumed the mantle of Batgirl. After violating Batman's code against extreme violence, she was stripped of the mantle and returned to her alias of the Huntress.\n\n====Charlotte \"Charlie\" Gage-Radcliffe====\n{{main|Misfit (DC Comics)}}\nAfter Cassandra Cain abandoned the role, a mystery character appeared as the new Batgirl in the ''Birds of Prey'' comic. Possessing superpowers, the teen claimed the empty mantle in an attempt to honor the character. However, Barbara Gordon quickly dissuaded the teen from continuing in the role. Charlie Gage-Radcliffe acquiesced, but modified her costume and changed her name to the Misfit.\n\n==Cultural impact==\nWhile Barbara Gordon and Cassandra Cain have both been the subject of academic analysis regarding the [[portrayal of women in comics]], commentary on Barbara Gordon's Batgirl has focused on her character's connection to the [[women's liberation movement]], doctoral degree and career as a librarian, while analysis of Cassandra Cain's Batgirl has focused on the character's double minority status as a woman and a [[person of color]]. Since her debut in DC Comics publication, and fueled by her adaptation into the ''Batman'' television series in 1967, Barbara Gordon's Batgirl has been listed among fictional characters that are regarded as cultural icons.<ref name=Early2003>{{cite book\n|author=Early, Frances H.\n|author2=Kennedy, Kathleen\n|title=Athena's Daughters: Television's New Women Warriors\n|publisher=[[Syracuse University Press]]\n|year=2003\n|page=187\n|isbn=978-0-313-33589-1\n}}</ref> Author Brian Cronin, in ''Was Superman A Spy?: And Other Comic Book Legends Revealed'' (2009) notes that following her 1967 debut, \"Batgirl was soon popular enough to appear regularly over the next two decades and Yvonne Craig certainly made an impression on many viewers with her one season portraying young Ms. Gordon.\"<ref name=Spy/> In 2011, [[IGN]] ranked Barbara Gordon 17th in the Top 100 Comic Books Heroes.<ref name=Top100IGN>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.ign.com/top/comic-book-heroes/17\n|title= Top 100 Comic Book Heroes\n|publisher=IGN Entertainment\n|access-date=2011-07-06}}</ref> Cassandra Cain's Batgirl has become one of the most prominent Asian characters to appear in American comic books, and her understated sexuality is notable as being contrary to the common sexual objectification of female characters, especially those of Asian descent.{{sfn|Brown|2011|p=175}}\n\n===Feminist interpretations===\n{{quote box|quote=In the late 1950s and early 1960s, before the feminist revolution, Schwartz's leading ladies included a reporter (Iris West in The Flash), a lawyer (Jean Loring in The Atom), and even the head of an aircraft company (Carol Ferris in Green Lantern). Shiera Hall was merely a secretary at the Midway City Museum, but as Hawkgirl she was a police officer on her native planet Thanagar and an equal partner to her husband Hawkman (Carter Hall) in their superheroic exploits. Then there was Zatanna, bravely traversing the dimensions in her search for her missing father (as chronicled in the recent DC trade paperback Zatanna's Quest). Barbara Gordon initially conformed to hackneyed stereotypes as a dowdy librarian, but her transformation into Batgirl could be seen in retrospect as a symbol of the emerging female empowerment movement of the 1960s. (Moreover, by the 1970s Barbara had given herself a makeover even in her \"civilian identity\" and ran for Congress.)|source=\u2014[[Peter Sanderson]], [[IGN]], 2005<ref name=Sanderson2007>{{cite web\n|last=Sanderson\n|first=Peter\n|author-link=Peter Sanderson\n|title=Comics in Context #67: Catch As Cats Can\n|url=http://comics.ign.com/articles/595/595646p7.html\n|website=IGN\n|date=2005-01-07\n|access-date=2007-11-22\n|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501095446/http://comics.ign.com/articles/595/595646p7.html\n|archive-date=2011-05-01\n|url-status=dead\n}}</ref>|width=350px}}\nIn ''The Supergirls: Fashion, Feminism, Fantasy, and the History of Comic Book Heroines'' (2009), author Mike Madrid states that what set Barbara Gordon as Batgirl apart from other female characters was her motivation for crime-fighting.

[[Dina Meyer]] starred as Barbara Gordon in the television series ''[[Birds of Prey (TV series)|Birds of Prey]]'' (2002). Although this series focused on her role as the Oracle, the series included flashbacks of the character's history as Batgirl.\n\nIn the film ''[[Batman & Robin (1997 film)|Batman & Robin]]'', [[Alicia Silverstone]] played a variation of the character: Barbara Wilson, [[Alfred Pennyworth]]'s niece. She appears in ''[[The Lego Batman Movie]]'' voiced by [[Rosario Dawson]]. The character is introduced as Barbara Gordon taking over from her father Jim Gordon to become the new Police Commissioner of Gotham. Towards the end of the film, she dons her cowl and teams up with Batman as Batgirl in addition to her role as Commissioner.\n\nIn ''The Dark Knight'' trilogy, James Gordon's wife is named Barbara Gordon, portrayed by Ilyssa Fradin in ''[[Batman Begins]]'' and Melinda McGraw in ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]''. This is not a reference to Batgirl Barbara Gordon. It's been long established, most notably in the famous Batman: Year One, that the wife of James Gordon is named Barbara.\n\nIn addition to live-action television and animation, the character has appeared in a number of video games included in the Batman franchise. She appears in ''[[The Adventures of Batman & Robin (video game)|The Adventures of Batman & Robin]]'' and ''[[Batman: Rise of Sin Tzu]]'' voiced by [[Tara Strong]]. She also appears in ''[[Lego Batman: The Videogame|Lego Batman]]'' for the [[personal computer|PC]], [[PlayStation 2]], [[PlayStation 3]], [[Xbox 360]], [[Wii]], [[Nintendo DS|DS]], and [[PlayStation Portable]].<ref>''[[Game Informer]]'' features a two-page gallery of the many heroes and villains who appear in the game with a picture for each character and a descriptive paragraph.

The other three Batgirls (Bette Kane, Stephanie Brown and Cassandra Cain) can be spawned and all three are playable in the Wii U version. Barbara Gordon has been featured in all four main games of the critically acclaimed [[Batman: Arkham|''Batman: Arkham'' series]], though she is only seen as Batgirl in the \"A Matter of Family\" [[Downloadable content|DLC]] for the last game, ''[[Batman: Arkham Knight]]'' (2015), in which she is playable. Set before the events of the series' [[Batman: Arkham Asylum|first installment]], the DLC's plot revolves around Batgirl and [[Tim Drake|Robin]] attempting to save the former's father, along with other police officers, from the [[Joker (character)|Joker]] at an abandoned amusement park located on an [[Oil platform|oil rig]]. A child version of Barbara Gordon made an appearance in the television series ''[[Gotham (TV series)|Gotham]]''.
