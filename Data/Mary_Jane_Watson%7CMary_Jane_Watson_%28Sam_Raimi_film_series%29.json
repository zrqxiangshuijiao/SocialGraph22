The character was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[John Romita Sr.]], and made her first appearance in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #25. Since then, she has gone on to become [[Spider-Man]]'s main love interest and later his wife. Mary Jane is the most famous and prominent love interest of [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]] due to their long history, as she is also represented in most Spider-Man media and adaptations.\n\nAlthough she made a brief first appearance in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #25 with a plant obscuring her exterior, Mary Jane's first official face reveal was in a cameo appearance ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #42. Designed and drawn by John Romita Sr., her entrance is regarded as one of the most iconic introductions in comic history, owing it to its build-up, her hyper-vibrant red hair and her most famous line, \"Face it, Tiger... you just hit the jackpot!\" Since then, 'Tiger' has been her most recognizable nickname for [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]], spanning comics and media adaptations.\n\nInitially set up by [[May Parker|Aunt May]] as a [[blind date]], redheaded party girl Mary Jane \"MJ\" Watson was depicted in her early appearances as [[Gwen Stacy]]'s competition. Though Peter dated her briefly before Gwen, both of them broke it off as Peter saw her flamboyance, flakiness and 'life of the party' personality as shallow and MJ does not want to be tied down by a man. She eventually became Peter's main love interest after Gwen's death at the hands of the [[Green Goblin]]. The pair formed a bond, as Mary Jane became a more open-hearted person. She and Peter got closer, fell deeply in love, had an on-off relationship for years and eventually married. Despite their marriage being undone due to the timeline manipulations by the villain [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]], Mary Jane and Peter retained a close friendship. They later resumed their romantic relationship for some time and are destined to have a daughter that will end Mephisto's eventual reign over the Earth.\n\nStarting from her memorable debut, Mary Jane Watson has earned a place in comic polls over the years\u2014making her the most popular \"non-powered\" character in the Marvel universe and one of the best known female love interests in superhero pop culture.\n\n[[Kirsten Dunst]] portrayed the [[Mary Jane Watson (Sam Raimi film series)|character]] in [[Spider-Man (2002 film series)|Sam Raimi's ''Spider-Man'' trilogy]], [[Shailene Woodley]] had an uncredited silent [[cameo appearance]] as the character in the 2014 film ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man 2]]'', [[Zendaya]] portrays a reimagined version of the [[MJ (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|character]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]], and [[Zo\u00eb Kravitz]] voiced the character in the 2018 animated film ''[[Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse]]''.\n\n== Publication history ==\nMary Jane Watson is mentioned in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #15 (August 1964), and is initially used as a running joke of the series, as [[Peter Parker]]'s [[Aunt May]] repeatedly attempts to set her unwilling nephew up on a date with her. Parker (also known as Spider-Man) consistently worms his way out of meeting Mary Jane who, aside from a brief appearance in #25 (June 1965) with her face obscured, is never actually seen until ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #42 (November 1966).<ref>{{cite book|last1 = DeFalco|first1 = Tom|author-link = Tom DeFalco|editor-last = Gilbert|editor-first = Laura|chapter= 1960s|title = Marvel Chronicle A Year by Year History|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|year = 2008|page = 119|isbn =978-0-7566-4123-8|quote= After teasing the readers for more than two years, Stan Lee finally allowed Peter Parker to meet Mary Jane Watson.}}</ref> [[Peter David]] wrote in 2010 that artist [[John Romita Sr.]] \"made the definitive statement of his arrival by pulling Mary Jane out from behind the oversized potted plant [that blocked the readers' view of her face in issue #25] and placing her on panel in what would instantly become an iconic moment\".<ref>{{cite book|last1 = David|first1 = Peter|author-link = Peter David|last2 = Greenberger|first2 = Robert|author2-link = Robert Greenberger|title = The Spider-Man Vault: A Museum-in-a-Book with Rare Collectibles Spun from Marvel's Web|publisher = [[Running Press]]|year = 2010|page = [https://archive.org/details/sinatrahollywood0000knig/page/38 38]|isbn = 978-0-7624-3772-6|url = https://archive.org/details/sinatrahollywood0000knig/page/38}}</ref> Romita has stated that in designing Mary Jane, he \"used [[Ann-Margret]] from the movie ''[[Bye Bye Birdie (1963 film)|Bye Bye Birdie]]'' as a guide, using her coloring, the shape of her face, her red hair and her form-fitting short skirts\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Saffel|first=Steve|title= Spider-Man the Icon: The Life and Times of a Pop Culture Phenomenon|publisher=[[Titan Books]]|year= 2007|isbn= 978-1-84576-324-4|chapter= A Legend Is Born|page= 27}}</ref>\n\nAccording to co-creator [[Stan Lee]], he and Romita had intended for [[Gwen Stacy]] to be Spider-Man's one true love, and introduced Mary Jane \"just for fun\", but that \"somehow, Mary Jane seemed to have all the personality, and much as we tried to make Gwen more attractive, we couldn't!

Fans surprisingly liked Mary Jane more and demanded for her to replace Gwen's role as Peter Parker's main love interest as readers found Mary Jane more exciting and that \"no matter how we [i.e. Lee and his artist/co-plotter collaborators] wrote it, Mary Jane always seemed more interesting!\".<ref>{{cite news|last=Fisch|first=Sholly|title=The Wedding of the Year|work=[[Marvel Age]]|issue=54|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]|date=September 1987|pages=12\u201315}}</ref><ref name=\"Thomas 30\" />\nThe names \"Mary Jane\" and \"MJ<!--no dots-->\" are also common slang terms for [[marijuana]].

Gwen didn't have an edge. She was just a nice person.

DeMatteis]] made Mary Jane and her marriage to Spider-Man one of the central themes of the critically acclaimed \"[[Kraven's Last Hunt]]\", published the same year as the wedding. DeMatteis commented that \"'Kraven's Last Hunt' has a lot of darkness in it, but the story primarily is about Peter and his journey into the light and the power of simple human love.

In 2007, Quesada presided over the controversial \"[[Spider-Man: One More Day|One More Day]]\" storyline, which he also drew, in which Peter and Mary Jane's marriage is erased from history and everyone's memories by the devil [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]]. Quesada states he is an avid fan of the Peter and MJ relationship, and in several interviews has claimed that the alternate [[Marvel Comics 2|MC2]] universe, in which Peter and Mary Jane are happily married, is a \"natural progression\" of the characters.\n\nThe erasing of Peter and Mary Jane's marriage was initially adopted in the newspaper strip as well, but due to negative reader reaction Lee later revealed it to be a bad dream.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Cassell|first=Dewey |date=October 2010|title=One Day at a Time: The Amazing Spider-Man Newspaper Strips |journal=[[Back Issue!]]|issue=44| page=64|publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}</ref> Mary Jane remains Spider-Man's wife in the newspaper strip continuity.\n\nAlthough the marriage stayed erased, Mary Jane and Peter Parker became a couple again during [[Nick Spencer]]'s run in ''Amazing Spider-Man''.

Initially, she competed with others for Peter's affection, most prominently with [[Gwen Stacy]] and the [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]].

It is not until ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #42 (November 1966) that her face is actually seen.

However, they eventually become irritated with each other and Peter subsequently chooses to date Gwen. Mary Jane, who becomes [[Harry Osborn]]'s former love interest and former girlfriend for about a year, remains a close friend to Peter and Gwen.\n\nDespite her enjoyment of life, her friendships, and dating, Mary Jane refuses to be tied down for too long. When her relationship with Harry Osborn comes to an end, it has significant impact on Harry, driving him to a drug overdose.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #96\u201397 (May\u2013June 1971)</ref> This in turn creates a [[Unintended consequences|boomerang effect]], driving his father [[Norman Osborn]] to the brink of insanity, temporarily restoring his memories as the [[Green Goblin]].<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #121 (June 1973)</ref>\n\nAfter the Green Goblin murders Gwen in [[The Night Gwen Stacy Died|''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #121]], Mary Jane attempts to comfort Peter.

He questions her ability to ever care about people like him and Gwen, and states \"You wouldn't be sorry if your own mother died,\" unaware that her mother had actually died. Mary Jane is hurt by Peter's comments. She attempts to leave, but hesitates as she approaches the door, and ultimately chooses to stay with him.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #122 (July 1973)</ref> This served as a turning point in their relationship, and over the next couple of years, she and Peter become very close friends. Eventually, upon realizing the feelings that they share for one another, they decide to take their relationship to the next level, having sex in the process.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #149-150</ref> Their relationship has a few initial hurdles, such as MJ's hot temper and Peter's always dashing off to be Spider-Man. Following the events of the original clone saga, Peter realizes that Mary Jane is the girl he has always loved, and the two begin dating again.\n\nDespite loving Peter, MJ does not wish to be tied down. Yet, she allows the relationship to progress and is left with a difficult decision when Peter proposes to her.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #182</ref> After taking a short time to consider, she turns him down.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #183</ref> Following a series of traumatic experiences involving Peter's absences and his costumed alter ego endangering his Aunt May, a spiritually exhausted MJ leaves New York for several months.

Following an attack on Peter by [[Puma (comics)|Puma]], she breaks down and admits her knowledge of Peter's [[secret identity]] in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #257. After learning of her own family history in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #259, Peter finds a new respect for her and begins to truly understand her. MJ makes it clear to Peter that knowing his identity changes nothing about her feelings, and that she only loves him as a friend, her best friend.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #259 (December 1984)</ref>\n\nDespite the one-shot graphic novel ''Amazing Spider-Man: Parallel Lives'' and ''Untold Tales of Spider-Man'' #16 revealing that Mary Jane discovered Peter's secret when she noticed Spider-Man climbing out of Peter's bedroom window after his uncle's murder, many comics published before this revelation claimed that she had simply \"figured it out\", with the details of how and when left ambiguous to the reader.\n\nAfter yet another period of reconsidering his priorities in life, Peter contemplates letting go of the Spider-Man mantle, with Mary Jane backing the decision, but his relationship with Felicia Hardy soon resumes.

When she rejects his advances, he kidnaps her, but she manages to escape. While Caesar is briefly incarcerated, he uses his powerful business connections within the city and has her blacklisted as a model. She gets a role on the soap opera ''Secret Hospital'', but is unhappy with her character's air-headed and mean personality. On top of that, Caesar, who has been released from prison and is still obsessed with Mary Jane, plots to kidnap her again\u2014this time intending to whisk her away to a private island he owns in the Caribbean. After luring Mary Jane to an abandoned studio and threatening to kill her, Caesar is confronted by Officer Goldman, a policeman assigned to Mary Jane's original case against him. Goldman then shoots Caesar dead, saving Mary Jane's life. Although she successfully petitions her boss to adjust her character's personality, a deranged fan tries to kill Mary Jane out of hatred for the actions of her soap opera character. Mary Jane quits her job out of fear for her own safety and returns to modeling. This, along with Peter's role as Spider-Man, triggers a growing divide. She briefly flirts with actor Jason Jerome, who tries to tempt her into a secret affair. She resists out of faithfulness to Peter, but her weak rebuffs fail to convince Jerome, and she realizes she is enticed by him in spite of herself.<ref>''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #166\u2013171. Marvel Comics.</ref> However, she eventually realizes that her craving for romance can be filled by her husband as easily as an extramarital affair, and she pointedly rejects Jerome's advances while rebuking his behavior.<ref>''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #172. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nDue to this stress, and the seeming return of her husband's parents, Mary Jane begins smoking (a habit she had quit in high school), only increasing the tension between her and Peter. Peter ultimately convinces her to stop smoking when he tricks her into visiting Nick Katzenberg suffering heavily from lung cancer. When his parents are discovered to be fakes, Peter is unable to cope with the knowledge and disappears for a time. Mary Jane visits her sister Gayle and her father for the first time in years, and finally reconciles with them. Meanwhile, Peter overcomes his problems on his own. When she and Peter reunite, both are happier than they had been in a long time.\n\n=== Pregnancy ===\nDuring the 1994\u201396 \"[[Clone Saga]]\" storyline, Peter's clone, [[Ben Reilly]], appears. Mary Jane discovers that she is pregnant. While she experiences some complications in her pregnancy, Reilly's scientist friend Seward Trainer helps her. Peter and Ben are told by Trainer that Ben is the real Peter Parker, and Peter is the clone. After conducting the tests themselves (tests which Seward rigged) they confirm Seward's story. A disbelieving Peter, while arguing with Ben, strikes Mary Jane. After this, he decides to quit as Spider-Man, because the stress of his double life is endangering his wife and unborn child. Peter, acting on hypnotic suggestion by the [[Jackal (Marvel Comics)|Jackal]], attempts to kill Mary Jane, but is prevented by Ben Reilly (as the Scarlet Spider), his teammates the [[New Warriors]], and [[Kaine Parker|Kaine]]. Later, Peter and Mary Jane leave New York and move to Portland, Oregon. They live there peacefully for several months, adapting happily to normal life after an accident causes subtle damage to Peter's genetic structure that disrupts his ability to use his powers. However, they miss New York City and their friends, and move back, a strange illness culminating in the restoration of Peter's powers. During the [[Onslaught (Marvel Comics)|Onslaught]] crisis, Mary Jane is scanned by a [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinel]] robot, who detects genetic abnormalities in her [[fetus]].<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #415 (Sep 1996)</ref>\n\nSoon afterward, when Mary Jane's baby is already past due, she is poisoned by [[Alison Mongrain]], an agent of the [[Green Goblin]]. Mary Jane's baby is [[Stillbirth|stillborn]].<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #418</ref> Combined with Ben's death in a battle with the reborn Norman Osborn and the revelation that the tests identifying Peter as the clone were actually rigged as part of Osborn's plan to break Peter's spirit, Peter returns to the role of Spider-Man.<ref>''Peter Parker: Spider-Man'' #75</ref>\n\n=== Marital problems ===\nMary Jane returns to college to major in [[psychology]], but the stress of the ongoing manipulations of Norman Osborn take their toll. After the Gathering of Five incident and the return of Aunt May, Mary Jane begs Peter to quit being Spider-Man.\n\nHe is happy to do so for several months, but soon feels the tug of his great power and great responsibility to be a hero. Meanwhile, Mary Jane is offered a new modeling contract and reaches new heights of success. Peter becomes Spider-Man again behind Mary Jane's back, which puts strain on their marriage. At the same time, she begins receiving lewd and threatening phone calls from an anonymous stalker. Mary Jane is flying across America when her airplane explodes in midair in ''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 2 #13 (January 2000). Peter is shocked and goes into deep denial over her death. Although he is set up with several other women, and his friends encourage him to move on, he believes she is still alive. Her mysterious stalker, an unnamed, telepathic mutant, has telepathically connected to Peter in some way, and wants to take over his life. He kidnapped Mary Jane as part of his plan and held her hostage for several months. The stalker kills himself after finally gleaning enough of Peter's personality and morality to discover that he had done terrible things. Peter and Mary Jane are reunited in ''[[Peter Parker: Spider-Man]]'' #29 (June 2001).\n\nThe stress of her captivity drives Mary Jane away. She moves to [[Los Angeles]] and immerses herself in acting \u2014 starring as the doomed love interest in the film ''Lobster-Man''. Although missing Peter after he fails to meet her on a visit back to New York, she refuses to talk to him; Aunt May gets Peter to visit her in Los Angeles,<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 2 #43 (September 2002)</ref> however the two remain separated. Peter's encounter with the supernatural Spider-Wasp Shathra eventually leads to the two of them flying to New York and Los Angeles to see each other. Despite missing each other at their respective homes, they meet in an airport in Denver, Colorado where they reconcile after a brief encounter with Doctor Doom and Latverian terrorists.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 2 #50 (April 2003)</ref>\n\n=== \"Civil War\" ===\nDuring the events of the 2006\u20132007 \"[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]\" storyline, when Peter and Mary Jane's apartment and Aunt May's house are burned down by Charlie Weiderman, and Spider-Man joins the [[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]], Mary Jane and Aunt May accompany him to live in [[Stark Tower]]. Mary Jane immediately feels at home with the New Avengers and is happy to finally be a part of Spider-Man's world.\n\nThe [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]] events forced Peter to stage a secret transfer of Mary Jane out of Stark Mansion, feeling that with the loss of his [[secret identity]] and his doubts about [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]]'s ideas, Mary Jane had become a hostage in a luxurious house. Now residing in a cheap motel, her whole life had been affected, from her increasing difficulties in finding a new job as an actress to her being an easy target and prey, along with Aunt May, for the superpowered foes of Spider-Man.\n\nPeter, Mary Jane, and Aunt May are targeted by an assassin working for Spider-Man's old foe, the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]]. When Peter returns to the Parker family's motel hideout, the assassin takes aim at Peter and fires, but hits Aunt May instead.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #538</ref> Peter and MJ scramble to save Aunt May's life, rushing her from hospital to hospital while trying to maintain their fragile cover of anonymity. In trying to keep May alive and hidden from Spider-Man's enemies, they become fugitives on the run.\n\n=== \"One More Day\" ===\nDuring the 2007 \"[[Spider-Man: One More Day|One More Day]]\" storyline, Peter is forced to decide whether he will accept [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]]'s offer to save Aunt May in return for wiping the knowledge and memory of Peter and MJ's life together as husband and wife from the face of reality, which would leave only a single, subconscious piece of their souls to remember their love and life together, allowing [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]] to feast on the pain exhibited by those vestiges for eternity.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #544</ref>\n\nMJ, despite loving Peter, accepts Mephisto's offer, but only with the caveat that Mephisto promises to restore Spider-Man's secret identity. She also asks to put his life back as it was and have a chance at happiness. Mephisto accepts these terms, and in the revised timeline, which begins at the end of ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #545, and is further explained in the following issues, MJ and Peter were never married but instead \"dated seriously for years\".\n\nAccording to interviews conducted with then-Marvel editor-in-chief [[Joe Quesada]], every story prior to this story remains [[canon (fiction)|canon]] (this would later be contradicted as the events of later stories imply MJ never fell pregnant). Quesada also stated that a gap of undefined duration occurred between pages in \"One More Day\", during which the couple separated. By the end of that period, MJ has moved to California to become an actress, but continues to visit New York from time to time. In the epilogue to \"One More Day\", she attends a \"coming home\" party held by ex-[[Harry Osborn]] during one such visit, with Peter catching a small glimpse of her before she left, after ignoring her.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #545 (2007)</ref>\n\n=== New life ===\nAt the end of ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #560, as part of the \"[[Spider-Man: Brand New Day|Brand New Day]]\" storyline, Mary Jane makes her return as the girlfriend of actor Bobby Carr. In ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #561, Mary Jane is seen getting into bed with Carr, and is later attacked by Paperdoll. Concealing herself in the panic room, Mary Jane observes a battle between Spider-Man and Paperdoll, and communicates with Spider-Man over the intercom. Mary Jane says that she and Spider-Man made a great team \"in another life\" and longingly touches a monitor screen showing his face, hinting that she still has strong feelings and misses him.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #561</ref>\n\nPeter does not learn that Mary Jane is the girlfriend of Carr nor that she was the voice on the intercom. Mary Jane is seen at the conclusion of the issue contemplating a phone call to Peter, but is hesitant to do so. She is asked for an autograph by Sara Ehret, an associate of [[Jackpot (comics)|Jackpot]]. Mary Jane tells her she does not know when she will return to New York. She left a message on Peter's machine but it was cut off before she could say anything.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #591</ref>\n\nMary Jane has been living on the West Coast pursuing her acting career. She returns to New York after Carr is found to be taking Mutant Growth Hormone for a movie role, supplied by the [[White Rabbit (comics)|White Rabbit]]. Carr complains that now she would tell them all about his drug use. His shallowness makes MJ walk away from him and take a TV job, which takes her back to New York City.\n\nMary Jane and Peter agree to meet with each other. Peter does not remember when or where as he had been drunk, and is further delayed due to his activities as Spider-Man. MJ also was drunk (while waiting for Peter to muster his courage in order to talk to her) and while she recalls their meeting she has overslept it. Issue 605 flashbacks to Mary Jane recalling a fight with Peter while he was dressed as Spider-Man, where she said that she did not care where he was and that he had a responsibility to their relationship. Peter begins to explain about his [[Uncle Ben]], but Mary Jane interrupts him to say that he cannot let a single moment define his life.\n\nIn the 2010 \"[[One Moment in Time (comics)|One Moment in Time]]\" storyline, it is revealed that Mary Jane whispered to Mephisto that Peter would not agree to the deal unless Mary Jane tells him to make it, and that Mephisto will leave Peter alone forever when the deal is done. Mephisto replies \"Agreed, as far as I'm concerned\u2014this never happened.\" MJ did that to protect Peter. In present time MJ shows up at Peter's door. They talk about how they have been acting towards each other lately and both agree they want to be friends. They recall how Peter missed what was supposed to be their wedding day due to his activities as Spider-Man,<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #638</ref> leading MJ to demand that he retire from crimefighting. His refusal to do so convinced MJ that they must remain unmarried, since any children they might have would be endangered by his being a superhero.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #639</ref>\n\nMary Jane goes to check on Anna Watson, just in time to stop a hitman, who goes after her. Spider-Man saves Mary Jane and dispatches the hitman. Spider-Man brings the wounded Mary Jane to Doctor Strange, who performs a healing spell on her. Peter insists that Doctor Strange should make people forget he is Spider-Man.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #640. Marvel Comics</ref> Peter enters a protective shell to shield himself from the changes. At the last moment, he leaps out of the shield and pulls Mary Jane in with him so she will not forget either. Back in the present, Mary Jane explains that, although she still loves him, she is not strong enough to be at his side. She tells him he has to move on and find somebody who can be with him.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #641. Marvel Comics</ref>\n\nPeter soon begins a new relationship with [[Carlie Cooper]]. Though initially jealous, MJ decides to respect their relationship, and encourages Peter to reveal his secret identity only to her.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #652</ref>\n\n=== \"Spider-Island\" and \"Ends of the Earth\" ===\nDuring the \"[[Spider-Island]]\" storyline, much of New York City becomes infected with a virus that gives its inhabitants Peter's Spider-like abilities. MJ, who did not manifest any powers, finds herself caught in a series of riots across the city.<ref name=\"ASM670\">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #670. Marvel Comics</ref> Saved by the intervening [[Future Foundation]], MJ later locates Peter and Carlie, the latter having also been granted spider-powers. MJ encourages Peter to use his civilian disguise when displaying his powers and rally the city against the chaos. She would later attain spider-powers herself and come to the aid of defenseless citizens, her prolonged contact with Peter during their relationship granting her a degree of immunity that protected her from [[Queen (Marvel Comics)|Adriana Soria]]'s mutative side-effects of the transformation. Peter successfully cures all of New York.<ref name=\"ASM672\">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #672. Marvel Comics</ref><ref name=\"ASM673\">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #673. Marvel Comics</ref>\n\nShortly after, Carlie Cooper breaks up with Peter, having deduced his secret identity. Conflicted over her lingering feelings for Peter, Carlie confides in Mary Jane, and the two begin to bond over their experiences with Peter.\n\nIn the 2012 storyline \"[[Ends of the Earth (Marvel Comics)|Ends of the Earth]]\", Mary Jane purchases a nightclub.<ref name=\"ASM688\">Slott, Dan (w). ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #688. Marvel Comics</ref>\n\n=== \"Dying Wish\" and ''The Superior Spider-Man'' ===\nMary Jane remains in the role of best friend and confidant to Peter until he begins to take an interest in her romantically again. They begin dating again. Unknown to MJ, Peter has had his mind swapped by [[Otto Octavius]]. The real Peter Parker, trapped in his rival's dying body, breaks out of prison and attempts to switch back, only for his body to eventually give out on him before he can complete the procedure. As a last resort, Peter downloads all of his memories and experiences into Octavius' mind, convincing his foe to develop some sense of responsibility.<ref name=\"ASM700\">[[Slott, Dan]] (w), [[Ramos, Humberto]] (p). ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #700. Marvel Comics</ref> Octavius, as Peter, continues to date Mary Jane after this, but she begins noticing distinctly different character traits displayed by him, such as a heavy intake of alcohol and his rude behavior towards his loved ones.<ref>Slott, Dan (w). ''The Superior Spider-Man'' #1. Marvel Comics</ref> Octavius intends to become more intimate with her and makes several advances, only to be rebuffed each time. In desperation and frustration, Octavius relives Peter's memories with MJ, which infuriates Peter. After one of Octavius' Spider-Bots detect Mary Jane in trouble and saves her from the Vulture gang, Mary Jane moves to kiss him, but Octavius, who has by now developed genuine feelings for her, rebuffs her, and breaks up with her, though vowing to continue to protect her.<ref>Slott, Dan (w). ''The Superior Spider-Man'' #2. Marvel Comics</ref>\n\nPeter's mind is returned to his body, and informs Mary Jane that it was Octavius' mind in control of Peter's body for the past several months. Mary Jane tells him that she knows Octavius' actions were not Peter's fault, but she cannot let his dual life affect her anymore. She recognizes and admires the choices Peter has made in his life, but now she wants to build her own life, mostly thanks to the successes she has enjoyed with her nightclub and her new relationship with Ollie.<ref>Slott, Dan (w). ''The Superior Spider-Man'' #31. Marvel Comics</ref>\n\n=== All-New, All-Different Marvel ===\nAs part of the [[All-New, All-Different Marvel]] event, Mary Jane Watson is in Chicago, Illinois hosting the opening of her newest nightclub Jackpot. Having ended her relationship with Ollie, Mary Jane had opened this nightclub after MJ's got destroyed during a superhero battle. When a Belhilio is quickly killed by an energy blast from Madame Masque, people start to run away as Iron Man and Doctor Doom arrive to confront her.<ref>''Invincible Iron Man'' Vol. 3 #4</ref> With Mary Jane's assistance, Masque is apprehended, but during the fight the nightclub is irrevocably damaged. Three days later, Iron Man approaches Mary Jane Watson in Grant Park while she is mourning the loss of her club and offers her a job working for him.<ref>''Invincible Iron Man'' Vol. 3 #5</ref> Mary Jane later waits for Tony Stark at Stark Tower, but their audition is interrupted by [[F.R.I.D.A.Y.]], who tells them that War Machine is missing. Before Tony becomes Iron Man and flies to Tokyo, Mary Jane gives Tony the emergency number for Peter Parker.<ref>''Invincible Iron Man'' Vol. 3 #7</ref> It is revealed that Mary Jane declined Tony Stark's offer due to being uncomfortable around F.R.I.D.A.Y.<ref>''Invincible Iron Man'' Vol. 3 #8</ref> However, Tony sends F.R.I.D.A.Y. to plead Mary Jane to help him stop the board of directors from seizing his company while he is off on a mission. Mary Jane claims to the board of directors that she is the new executive administrator, and she and F.R.I.D.A.Y. convince the board that the company is in safe hands.<ref>''Invincible Iron Man'' Vol. 3 #11</ref>\n\nIn the ''Amazing Spider-Man'' series, it is revealed that she has eventually accepted Tony's employment offer when she and Tony attend a Parker Industry event, making Peter very uncomfortable. Later, she catches up with Betty Brant and Harry Osborn, and the three discover that businessman Augustus Roman is actually the powerful being known as Regent who is imprisoning heroes and villains to add to his own strength. Spider-Man and Iron Man try to stop Regent, but are defeated due to Regent's overwhelming power. With few options left, Mary Jane dons Peter's [[Iron Spider]] armor and uses her experience in Iron Man's suit and her brief spider powers in Spider-Island to assist Peter and Tony in battling Regent. During the fight, Mary Jane and Tony distract Regent long enough for Peter, Harry, and [[Miles Morales]] to release the rest of the prisoners. Mary Jane's attitude towards Peter during her time with him reminds Peter not to let his work take priority over his loved ones. Spider-Man warns Tony not to take Mary Jane for granted as Peter did not realize he lost Mary Jane until after she moved on.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 4 #12\u201315</ref>\n\nAfter \"[[Civil War II]]\", Tony was put into a comatose state and his body went missing due to his own covert machinations. Mary Jane along with [[Riri Williams]] and [[Amanda Armstrong]] went on a search for him, and it was not until F.R.I.D.A.Y. made a calculated analysis that the A.I. duplicate of Tony would know exactly where to find him. However, Tony was continually complicating the search by sending them to other locations, believing he needed his privacy until he was finally ready.\n\nAfter Peter's company went belly up, and he got a new career as the Daily Bugle's science editor, Mary Jane started being more supportive of Peter getting his life back on track. After a less than stellar [[Alchemax]] demonstration, Mary Jane and Peter started being more romantically involved, but as Peter still wore his Spider-Man suit, Mary Jane was conflicted: she wanted Peter to stop being Spider-Man but people really counted on him and she did not want to be the one to do that. She has Peter exit her apartment as Spider-Man so if anyone sees they will just think she was talking with him because she knows Stark.\n\nAfter Norman Osborn becomes the Red Goblin, MJ received a warning from Peter and adjusted Stark Tower's defences against a Symbiote intruder. However, because Venom arrived before Red Goblin, the defenses only injured Venom and had no effect on the Red Goblin. Surviving with minor injuries after a short skirmish, MJ urged Peter to absorb the Venom Symbiote, which would give him the edge to stop his arch-enemy. She, along with others attacked by Red Goblin, were cured of his Carnage spikes by Flash Thompson with the Anti-Venom symbiote.\n\n=== Fresh Start ===\nAs part of the [[Fresh Start (comics)|Fresh Start]] relaunch event, Peter's personal life took serious knocks in both his civilian and heroic life: his doctorate was determined to be based on plagiarized work (due to him having received the doctorate when Doctor Octopus was controlling his body and the scientist used his own work) which led to him being fired from the ''Bugle'', while the Kingpin tried to separate Spider-Man from other heroes by making him the only vigilante he would accept in the new anti-vigilante New York. However, his personal life picked up when he began reconnecting with Mary Jane more regularly and they talked about recent events. Finally, Peter told Mary Jane that he needed her in his life once again, prompting Mary Jane to decide on a \"fresh start\" and resume her relationship with him one more time.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 5 #1</ref>\n\nAs she and Peter resume dating, Mary Jane is encouraged by a returning Carlie Cooper to join a special support unit for associates, friends and partners of superheroes run by Jarvis called The Look Ups.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 5 #8</ref> Hesitant at first, Mary Jane eventually shares with the group her feelings for Peter, the loss of her job at Stark Industries, and her anxieties and occasional doubts about her importance to him. Afterwards, Jarvis compliments Mary Jane and tells her she is indispensable. MJ lets Peter know this when they spend the night together shortly after Peter's battle with the Thieves Guild. Peter admits to Mary Jane that he revealed his secret identity once more to Felicia Hardy, but Mary Jane tells him that she is not envious of this and understands.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 5 #10</ref>\n\nAfter Peter's return as a college student, Mary Jane joined him for a dinner visit with the Connors family, as Peter and Curt discussed Peter's being Curt's teacher assistant job offer. While Peter was reluctant to take the offer, Mary Jane tried to argue he take it, as the chance could help him going forward.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 5 #15</ref> While Peter is ill from fever, Mary Jane tries to care for him, but he goes running head long into danger as Taskmaster and Black Ant captured Curt Connors' son, Billy, and she worriedly awaits Peter as he departs.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 5 #16</ref> As she waits, she tries to alleviate her anxiety unaware that an unknown entity ([[List of Marvel Comics characters: K#Kindred|Kindred]]) is stalking her to get to Peter; but Kindred does not hurt her, viewing her as an innocent. After waking up, she tripped on Peter's dropped clothing and broke a window, and as she was cleaning herself up Peter returned in his black suit (courtesy of Kraven) in a rushed panic believing some terrible had befallen her, but Mary Jane assured him that she was safe.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 5 #18</ref><ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 5 #23</ref>\n\nWhile attending a play with Carlie Cooper (Peter missing the planned date as he attempts to find the missing Curt Connors), Mary Jane gets unwittingly involved in an attack by the new Electro, who takes the lead actress hostage and attempts to ransom her online, only to change plans due to the low response to finding out how many people would pay to kill her. After Carlie causes a distraction, Mary Jane is able to switch places with the actress and trick Electro into a trap that knocks the villain out. The subsequent popularity of Mary Jane's speech prompts new public interest in her former acting career, to the point that her old agent calls her about new offers.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 5 #25</ref>\n\nMary Jane accepts one of these new offers, and with Peter's encouragement and support, heads off for a two-month stint in Hollywood filming a new movie. Peter had hoped to accompany Mary Jane to the airport, but he was forced to cancel those plans to help out his sister [[List of Marvel Comics characters: T#T|Teresa Parker]]. By the time Peter's mission had concluded, MJ had departed. The two would have a conversation by phone later that evening where Mary Jane assured Peter she understood why he could not take her to the airport and gives him all her love. It is revealed Peter had intended to propose to Mary Jane again had he been able to see her off.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 5 #29</ref>\n\nSoon after filming started, Mary Jane discovered Mysterio's disguise as the movie's producer, who swore to her that this project was supposed to be an authentic depiction of his life.<ref>''The Amazing Mary Jane'' #1</ref> At first grudgingly, Mary Jane cooperated with him when the [[Savage Six]] began attacking the project after the Vulture felt offended for the \"unauthorized\" usage of his person in the plot.<ref>''The Amazing Mary Jane'' #1\u20136</ref> During an appearance on a talk show, Mary Jane witnessed a sinister, oni-masked individual committing a murder, and was placed under [[witness protection]].<ref>''The Amazing Mary Jane'' #6</ref>\n\nMary Jane ultimately returned to New York<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man.LR'' #51</ref> amidst the chaos inflicted by Peter's allies the Order of the Web, who had been possessed by Kindred. Mary Jane is caught in a head-on collision but survives and is rescued by Norman Osborn. Norman takes her back to Ravencroft where he reveals to her that he is now a changed man, cleansed of his sins, and that Kindred is his son Harry Osborn.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man.LR'' #52</ref> Mary Jane agrees to help Norman reach Harry and is brought to Kindred's lair, where she finds Peter and the Order of the Web are now captives. Harry tortures Peter, demanding that he confess to something, but MJ tells Harry Peter has no recollection of the precise sin. She tells Harry she blames herself for his downward spiral and offers to sacrifice herself. Norman suddenly attacks and seemingly cuts down Mary Jane with a pumpkin bomb, which enrages Harry.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 5 #55</ref> A panicked Peter checks on Mary Jane, but she assures him the bomb is a blank and that this all part of the plan. Kindred is ultimately captured by the alliance of Norman and Wilson Fisk.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 5 #56</ref>\n\nMary Jane decides to remain in New York and help Peter deal with the fall out of Kindred's attack. She takes him to the old theatre where she got her big break and encourages him to use performance art to vent out his frustrations. Peter does so and he eventually breaks down, MJ comforts him. After Peter heads off to attend class at ESU, Mary Jane discovers Mysterio was eavesdropping. Mysterio asks Mary Jane if she will ever tell her boyfriend about their working arrangement, MJ tells him Peter has enough on his mind, and asks Mysterio about Kindred, suspecting he knows the truth, but Mysterio does not commit to an answer <ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 5 #60</ref>\n\nPeter and Mary Jane eventually attend the premiere of MJ's new movie, and Peter is formerly introduced to Cage McKnight, still in the dark over his true identity. MJ tells Mysterio she will tell Peter the truth later tonight. Peter has a surprise of his own as he is planning to propose to Mary Jane when the movie is over, but the Savage Six take the opportunity to attack, eager for a taste of revenge on Mysterio. As the crowds in the movie theatre disperse, Mary Jane stops to help people who have fallen over, and stands her ground against the Tarantula. Peter switches to Spider-Man and comes to her rescue. Doctor Octopus and the four of his team then attack the theatre. Mysterio assists Mary Jane, exposing his identity to Peter and the Sinister and Savage teams. Mary Jane confesses to a concerned Peter that she knew who Mysterio was all along and vouches for him. Mysterio tries to tell Peter that he and Mary Jane's deal with Mephisto is to blame for everything that is presently happening, but Peter is far too distracted by the warring factions.\n\nOtto offers Beck the opportunity to join the Sinister Six, as long as he helps them capture Mary Jane. Mysterio escapes, taking MJ with him, promising her that the 'devil will get his due'<ref>''Sinister War'' #1</ref>\n\nBeck takes Mary Jane to his old studios, he reveals to her of his prior demise and descent into hell, but that he was offered a chance at renewed life by Harry Osborn. Beck did as instructed and 'did his bidding', in exchange, Kindred opened up new worlds for Beck to explore such as the Ultimate Universe. Over time, the visits from Kindred became less frequent and Beck let his guard down, believing himself to be free, until Kindred had use for him again. Beck then reveals to Mary Jane that he was instrumental in helping her come to terms with Harry's 'death' in his guise of Doctor Ludwig Rinehart, although Mary Jane can barely recall this. Despite Mary Jane's pleas, Mysterio remains loyal to Kindred's plan and leaves her to his master's mercy<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 5 #71</ref>\n\nKindred unmasks to reveal the features of what appears to be Gwen Stacy, but is in actuality the husk of Sarah Stacy, the alleged daughter of Gwen and Norman Osborn. Mary Jane learns Kindred is still Harry using Sarah's body as a host, and that she nor her brother Gabriel was never truly Norman or Gwen's child, but clones created by an A.I version of Harry. Mary Jane also discovers that Mysterio tampered with her memories disguised as her therapist, which led her to believe the cloned twins were Gwen's children. Kindred tells Mary Jane the time has come to face her own sins and opens a doorway to Hell.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 5 #72\u201373</ref>\n\nMary Jane flees into one of Kindred's portals and arrives at Sarah and Gabriel's home in Paris, where she tends to a stricken Peter. She and Peter briefly banter until Norman arrives to warn them that Sarah and Gabriel are preparing to ambush them. As Peter holds his own against the twin Kindred, Norman admits to Mary Jane that he made a deal with Mephisto, to which MJ reacts with shock. Norman's son Harry, now revealed to have been a clone of the original, arrives to help tip the scales in Peter's conflict with Kindred, but is eventually, and brutally, cut down and killed. Peter is also eventually buried under rubble. Mary Jane comes to his rescue. Their unwavering commitment to one another rids the Kindred spirits of Mephisto's influence, and the Stacy twins are finally allowed to die.\n\nIn Las Vegas, Doctor Strange is involved in a high stakes gambit with Mephisto to free the true Harry Osborn's soul from the grasp of the devil, Upon succeeding, Strange asks Mephisto why he has attempted to claim Peter Parker.

As Doctor Strange departs, he reminds Mephisto that the love Peter shares with those closest to him will always enhance his life and make every one of them better. The vision of Mephisto's future changes to show it is a red-headed Spider-Woman, not Peter, who ultimately thwarts the devil's reign.\n\nMary Jane and Peter make their way home to heal and face the dawn of a new day together as a loving, and seemingly 'unbreakable', couple.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 5 #74</ref>\n\n===Spider-Man Beyond===\nIn the wake of Harry's death, Mary Jane advises a grieving Peter to perhaps devote some time to properly process the loss and take a break from being Spider-Man. Before Peter can consider these plans though, he is caught up in a battle with the perilous [[U-Foes]] that incapacitates him, leading to his hospitalisation.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 5 #75</ref> His clone, Ben Reilly, contacts Mary Jane and May Parker. Mary Jane is angry with Ben, believing him to be responsible for Peter's predicament. Peter then slips into a coma, but not before giving Ben his blessing to take the reins as Spider-Man in his absence.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 5 #76</ref>\n\nPeter eventually recovers and awakens from his coma, Mary Jane continues to look after him, and at one point saves him from a serial killer stalking the wards of the hospital<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 5 #82</ref>\n\nPeter's condition eventually draws out Felicia Hardy, and she and Mary Jane unite to save Peter from the clutches of criminal The Hood, who is need of his cloak.

The being tells Peter a path of blood has led him to his door and that Peter must come with him.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 5 #93</ref>\n\n===Six Months Later/Hellfire Gala===\nFollowing an incident that decimates a section of [[Pennsylvania]], Peter finds himself alienated from the superhero community and on bad terms with Mary Jane. The two have broken up and Mary Jane is now seemingly dating a man named Paul, with kids seeing Mary Jane as a mother figure, with the daughter heavily resembling her.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man Vol.6#1</ref> Despite their lack of communication, Mary Jane still shows concern for Peter when Felicia Hardy pays her a visit asking about his present whereabouts. <ref>''Amazing Spider-Man Vol.6#4''</ref> \n\nSometime later, Mary Jane and her Aunt Anna have become brand ambassadors for medical treatments supplied by the mutant island nation of [[Krakoa]], with an ailing Anna now suffering from [[dementia]]. Mary Jane arranges a meeting with Norman Osborn to verify that the treatments are safe to use. At Oscorp, she meets up with Peter, who apologises for routinely trying to call her when she did not want to be contacted. Mary Jane accepts his apology and attempts to tell him something truthful about how she is presently feeling when the two are interrupted by Paul. It is implied Paul has had a visceral encounter with Peter in the past. Mary Jane and Paul depart, with MJ telling Paul she has the assurances she needs to try out the medicines, and makes preparations to attend the annual [[Hellfire Gala]]. <ref>''Amazing Spider-Man vol.6#7'</ref>\n\nMJ later finds an intruder in her Aunt's house, the X-Men's former ally turned nemesis [[Moira MacTaggart]], who attacks her and renders her unconscious, intending to take her place at the Gala by disguising herself as her. <ref>''Free Comic Book Day 2022: X-Men#1''</ref>\n\nUsing Mary Jane as a 'meat puppet', Moira infiltrates the Gala and interacts with several in attendance, including her son Proteus and MJ's ex boyfriend Peter. Eventually, the X-Men uncover the truth behind Moira's infiltration, and Mary Jane temporarily breaks free of Moira's control to try and warn Logan of her predicament. Eventually, Moira escapes Krakoa along with a clone of Mr. Sinister, only for Peter and Wolverine to follow them. Later, Moria is seen meeting with Druig of the Eternals revealing the secrets of the Five's resurrection protocols. Moira has abandoned Mary Jane, with the implication that she has killed the Krakoan ambassador. <ref>Hellfire Gala 2022#1</ref>\n\nHowever, this is not the case, and Peter and Logan are able to successfully rescue Mary Jane. Upon returning to New York, Peter offers to talk to Mary Jane, but she refuses, Peter asks if it's because of Paul. When she confirms this is so, Peter challenges MJ on her feelings for Paul, but MJ angrily says this isn't about him, but about something she thought he understood: responsibility, and walks away<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man Vol. 6#9''</ref>\n\n== Other versions ==\n===''The Amazing Spider-Man: The Daily Comic Stri''p===\n\nAs a major character in the [[Spider-Man in other media#Comic strips|comic strip]] version of ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'', Mary Jane was a prominent character, flirting with Peter and serving as a persistent love interest. Mary Jane spent many years of the strip employed at a computer store. Peter would propose to Mary Jane several times in the strip only for her to reject these advances. Unlike her 616 variant, Mary Jane did not have exisiting knowledge of Peter's duel identity, only finding out when Peter finally confessed during the 1986 run of comic strips. Peter would propose to Mary Jane once again but she feared accepting would mean they would have children that could be afflicted with side-effects from Peter's radioactive blood, and rejected the proposal. Mary Jane briefly departed New York but eventually returned, fully prepared to leave Peter behind once and for all after becoming envious of the attention he was receiving from another woman. Peter assured Mary Jane his heart was always set on her and proposed one more time, this time Mary Jane accepted and they quickly eloped. \n\nMary Jane's stance on not having children with Peter ultimately also mellowed, and she would discuss the possibility of parenthood several times with her husband in the ensuing years. She would also begin to encourage Peter to spend more time vacationing with her. \n\nIn time, Mary Jane grew tired of her job selling computers and seized several opportunities to become an actress, spending time by herself in Los Angeles, with Peter eventually coming over to visit and spend the Christmas holidays with her. \n\nIn years past, Mary Jane's character constantly needed saving by Spider-Man. This resulted in a complaint by a reader that saw the strip dropped by the [[Toronto Star]] in the late '70s and early '80s. Mary Jane being in constant danger is often because she has risked her life to save Peter by joining in his battles, facing off against [[Doctor Doom]], [[Morbius, the Living Vampire|Morbius]], [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]]. and [[Doctor Octopus]]. Peter and MJ remain happily married despite all of these obstacles. MJ has also covered for Peter by taking photographs of his battles. After taking a photo of Sabretooth, Peter suggested they share the credit for the photo, but MJ refused, insisting she was \"just an actress\".{{citation needed|date=October 2020}}\n\nRecently, Mary Jane's successful stint with her Broadway play, ''Picture Perfect'', has given her and Peter financial stability, though Peter occasionally displays personal jealousy of MJ making more money, a fact MJ has teased him about whenever he contemplates quitting his regular job as a photographer, forcing him to reconsider to soothe his competitive ego. Despite these hang-ups, Peter continues to supports his wife's job and ambitions unconditionally. The Parkers at one point discussed moving into a new house using the revenue she was earning from the play, but nothing so far has come of those plans. Mary Jane's play was eventually forced to temporarily close due to the theatre needing much-needed maintenance. Producers of an old direct-to-video movie MJ starred in called ''Marvella'' eventually contacted her and offered her a contract to reprise her role, with a three-month filming schedule in New York. The filming brought her and Peter into conflict with Peter's old foe [[Mysterio]].{{citation needed|date=October 2020}}\n\nDuring the ''[[Spider-Verse]]'' event, the pair were visited by [[Morlun]]. Despite Morlun being a match for Peter's strength, MJ valiantly stands up to the intruder and encourages her husband. Due to the temporal instability affecting this reality, Morlun quickly realizes it will take weeks to accomplish a simple feat. The Master Weaver of the Inheritors then pulls him out of the reality, and privately elects to rebel against his masters, preserving this universe within a pocket dimension and safeguard it from any further Inheritor attacks. This action also prevents this universe from being affected by the reality-shattering events of [[Secret Wars]], and thus it does not form a part of the patchwork planet [[Battleworld]].<ref>{{cite comic|title=Spider-Verse|date=November 12, 2014|issue=#1|volume=1|publisher=Marvel Comics|page=33\u201334|story=Spider-Man|writer=[[Dan Slott|Slott, Dan]]|artist=[[Tom Grummett|Grummett, Tom]]|letterer=Lanham, Travis}}</ref>\n\nDuring production of ''Marvella II'', a brainwashed Harry Osborn, in the guise of The Hobgoblin, attacked her and Peter. The Black Widow, [[Natasha Romanov]] offered to serve as MJ's bodyguard for the duration of filming, but Mary Jane grew envious of the Black Widow spending time investigating Harry with her husband. Eventually Harry was stopped and Natasha made it clear to Mary Jane she had no interest in Peter romantically.{{citation needed|date=October 2020}}\n\nFollowing adventures in which she was pursued romantically by [[Sub-Mariner]] and [[Madame Xanadu|Xanadu]], Mary Jane learned that ''Marvella II'' had been given a theatrical release, and that she was to commence a publicity tour across the nation. She and Peter journeyed to Los Angeles by car, stopping in New Mexico along the way to team with [[Rocket Raccoon]] against the likes of [[Ronan the Accuser]] and a [[Kree]] sentry.{{citation needed|date=October 2020}}\n\nPeter and MJ briefly part ways when Peter decides to attend his Aunt's wedding to the Mole Man, while MJ moves forward with the tour. After an adventure with Mole Man (who calls off the wedding to rule over his people once more), Peter reunites with MJ in Florida where they help Bruce Banner battle The Lizard. MJ resumes her tour while Peter returns to New York. During a battle with The Kingpin, Mary Jane's theatre is destroyed by a helicopter crash. MJ catches wind of this on the news, but is not angry with Peter. She returns home and tells Peter ''Marvella II'' was not received well critically and is projected to bomb. She suggests she and Peter spend time in Australia until her play can be moved to a new theatre venue. When Peter was taken over by [[The Purple Man]], Mary Jane teamed up with [[Luke Cage]] to free him. Afterwards, Peter and MJ headed off to Australia, at which point the newspaper strip concluded.\n\n=== What If? ===\n* A widowed Mary Jane appears in ''What If?

Art by Stanley Lau.]]\nFollowing on from the events of ''Secret Wars'', where deadly incursions have laid waste to most of the multiverse, Battleworld, a planet composed of the remains of alternate realities, is created by [[Doctor Doom]] and [[Doctor Strange]], with each reality on the world divided into different domains. In this domain called the Regency, Mary Jane is married to Peter and they have a daughter named '''Annie May Parker.''' Spider-Man is seemingly the only hero left in the domain after the powerful Regent (Augustus Roman) kills the Avengers and establishes himself as ruler of the domain, with Peter opting to retire as Spider-Man to raise Annie and live up to his vows as a father. Peter did not fight Regent initially to protect his family from Venom and ends up killing Eddie Brock in the process at Mary Jane's request.{{issue|date=October 2020}}\n\nEight years later, Mary Jane is still struggling as an actress, while her husband is forced to make money off of photos he cannot publish for fear of making The Regent's forces look bad. Mary Jane takes Annie to school and instructs her not to reveal her powers in public even if the situation calls for it. However, they are forced to confront Regent eventually and stand their ground with some of the remaining heroes. After Annie gains a costume and assists her father in combat, Mary Jane obtains armor that acts similarly to Regent's tech which drained the powers of heroes to make him stronger in order to assist her family. She and Peter defeat the tyrant and resume their peaceful family life with Annie.{{issue|date=October 2020}}\n\nIn the follow-up series, Mary-Jane uses a modified version of the armor she used in the fight against Regent, which now replicates Spider-Man's powers and allows her to assist her family as Spinneret. However, every time she taps into Peter's powers, it weakens him significantly. She now operates her own clothing store in addition to being a mother and superhero.{{issue|date=October 2020}}\n\nIn an attempt to spare Peter from this, Mary Jane learns of a bio-enhanced suit in the possession of old family friend Liz Allan, and acquires it from her. However, the suit is revealed to be the [[Alternative versions of Venom#Secret Wars|Venom symbiote]], which briefly attempts to take control of Mary Jane and use her against Peter, attempting to gain revenge for Peter killing Eddie Brock. Peter uses the Regent tech to weaken the symbiote, allowing Mary Jane to retaliate and bring the symbiote under her control. The symbiote is eventually destroyed in their final battle with the Green Goblin and she continues raising Annie into her teenage years, designing a new costume for her older daughter in the process. Mary Jane takes the moniker '''Spinneret''' and Annie goes by '''Spiderling'''.{{issue|date=October 2020}}\n\nIt is implied that the 616 Peter, Mary Jane, and Regent retain memories of their counterparts from this Battleworld.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 4 #15</ref>\n\nThe Parker family of this world finally meet the Peter Parker of Earth 616 in the 2018 event ''[[Spider-Geddon]]''.

Its popularity led to the publication of two sequels: ''[[1602: New World]]'' and ''[[Spider-Man: 1602]]''. The character of Marion Jane Watsonne is introduced in ''[[Spider-Man: 1602]]'' #3. The Watsonne family are a theatrical troupe, originally from the same village in Scotland as [[Spider-Man|Peter Parquagh]]. Marion, an actress, must pose as a boy in England, because women are not allowed on the stage. In France, where Peter sees her, she is under no such restrictions. Marion encounters Peter when he saves the life of her brother, Graeme. After a brief stint as the troupe's acrobat, Peter is kidnapped by [[Doctor Octopus#Marvel 1602|Baron Octavius]] (this reality's version of [[Doctor Octopus]]). When he escapes, he discovers the troupe has been hired by Octavius and moved to Vienna. With her family locked in the dungeon and herself being used as bait to lure Peter into a trap, Marion and Peter are reunited. After a violent battle with several 1602 versions of the [[Green Goblin]], the [[Lizard (comics)|Lizard]], and [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]], the two find happiness with each other and presumably wed, but Peter is eventually killed by Morlun. On a final note, a preserved sample of Peter's blood is found 400 years later and becomes the basis for the Super-Soldier formula that would create [[Captain America]].{{issue|date=February 2013}}\n\n=== ''Marvel Zombies'' and ''Marvel Zombies Return'' ===\nIn ''[[Marvel Zombies]]'', an infected Peter Parker arrives home to save Mary Jane and Aunt May but he loses control and eats them instead. After he has eaten, Peter is consumed by the guilt and grief of what he has done to the last two people who ever loved him, refusing to take off his mask so he will not have to look himself in the eyes again. This guilt is a major plot point. ''[[Marvel Zombies Return]]: Spider-Man'' reveals that MJ was zombified after Peter ate her. She reappears in an alternative reality and is later seen being eaten by a [[Sinister Six#Marvel Zombies Return|zombified Sinister Six]] that the original zombie Spider-Man accidentally created when he succumbed to his hunger while trying to stop his enemies.<ref>''Marvel Zombies Return'' #3</ref>\n\n=== MC2 Universe ===\n[[File:Amazing Spider-Girl 8.jpg|thumb|Mary Jane Watson on the cover of ''[[Amazing Spider-Girl]]'' #8.]]\nIn the ''[[Marvel Comics 2|MC2]]'' universe, which depicts an alternative future timeline for the [[Marvel Universe]], Mary Jane remains married to Peter Parker. Peter's original clone [[Kaine Parker|Kaine]] reunited Mary Jane with her baby daughter in this continuity. Kaine had found the child living with agents of [[Norman Osborn]]. Mary Jane's daughter became [[Spider-Girl (Mayday Parker)|Spider-Girl]], alias [[May \"Mayday\" Parker]]. Many years later, after a complicated pregnancy, Mary Jane would give birth to a baby son, [[Benjamin Richard Parker|Benjamin]]. She is a respected fashion designer and businesswoman, secretly opening a store selling Spider-Girl related merchandise to pay for May's and Ben's educations. She has recently become a [[guidance counselor]] at May's school, where she learns of the anti-mutant group ''Humanity First''. She also becomes a mother figure to [[Alternative versions of Venom#Mayhem|April Parker]], the unstable symbiotic clone of Mayday for a time.{{issue|date=February 2013}}\n\nWhile caring for Baby May, Alison Mongraine became quite attached to the girl. Because of this, she returns years later to make contact with May. May and Mary Jane forgive Alison, who sincerely regrets her crime and loves the girl like her own child.{{issue|date=February 2013}}\n\nDuring the [[Spider-Verse]] event, the Parkers come under attack from Daeomos, brother to [[Morlun]], and a member of a powerful dimension-hopping family of parasites called Inheritors, who, like Morlun, feed on the animal totems of the living. As [[Daemos]] brings the Parker home crashing down around them, Mary Jane hands over Baby Benjamin to her daughter and instructs her to keep him safe, while she elects to stay behind and assist her husband in delaying the Inheritor. Mary Jane is heard to scream off-panel as Mayday evacuates the house with her brother. Peter is shown to have perished at Daemos' hand. Mayday is saved by other Spider-Men from alternate realitys who have been trying to rescue as many Spiders as possible from the Inheritors, and she vows to kill Daemos and avenge her fallen family. It is later revealed Benjy is the \"scion\" sought after by the Inheritors who will play a major part in a prophecy that will lead to their defeat. Ultimately, Baby Benjy is rescued and Mayday instead shows mercy to the Inheritors when she is presented with an opportunity to slay that family's own father, Solus.{{issue|date=October 2020}}\n\nWhen Mayday returns to her home dimension, she discovers Mary Jane and her boyfriend Wes are alive, MJ having managed to pull Wes out of the house before it collapsed. MJ confirms to Mayday that her husband is dead but that he would be glad to know his family are safe and sound. MJ suggests Mayday wear her father's costume in his honor. Mayday decides to retire from being Spider-Girl and becomes Spider-Woman.{{issue|date=October 2020}}\n\nIn ''Spider-Verse Team-Up #3'', while in hiding on a radiation-ravaged Earth inhabited by an alternate version of Peter's Uncle Ben, a grieving Mayday confesses to this Ben that she hopes  there are variants of her and her brother who are still together with their families. This was intended by the original ''Spider-Girl'' creative team as an 'out' for their loyal long-term readership, implying that the Mayday featured in the Spider-Verse event was herself just one of many similar variants and not necessarily the 'original' that Marvel had promoted for twelve years. ''Spider-Verse'' scribe [[Dan Slott]] would go on to strongly contest this on message forums.\n\nIn the follow-up event, ''Spider-Geddon'', Mayday reacts to a romantic kiss between the Peter and Mary Jane of the ''Renew Your Vows'' reality, mentioning that her mother's biggest desire is to also kiss her husband one last time. It is revealed at the conclusion of the story that the mystical Spider-Totem known as The Other has resurrected her father back on her world.<ref name=\"Spider-Geddon #5\"/> Dan Slott would take credit for deciding to bring back MC2 Peter.\n\n=== ''Spider-Island'' ===\nIn the ''Secret Wars'' Battleworld version of ''[[Spider-Island]]'', Mary Jane, [[Carlie Cooper]], [[Betty Brant]], and [[Sharon Carter]] were mutated into spider monsters by the Spider Queen and were used as bait for the resistance, as they also had bombs and tracking devices implanted in them. Spider-Man, Agent Venom, and Iron Goblin manage to subdue them and use Curt Connors' Lizard formula to mutate them into reptilian humanoids which freed them from the Spider Queen's control while the Vision removed the bombs from them just before they exploded.{{issue|date=October 2020}}\n\n=== ''Spider-Man: Reign'' ===\nIn the alternative future seen in ''[[Spider-Man: Reign]]'', Mary Jane died of terminal disease due to prolonged exposure to Peter's radioactive body fluids, her last words being \"Go...\" as he leaped out of a window to respond to sirens. It is believed that Mary Jane was trying to say \"Go get 'em, Tiger\". After her death, Peter buried his red and blue costume with her, wearing a black suit until his retirement. However, with the coming of the [[Sinister Six#Spider-Man: Reign|Sinner Six]] (and thanks to some encouragement from the tentacles of the now-deceased [[Doctor Octopus#Spider-Man: Reign|Doctor Octopus]]), Peter reclaims his original suit from Mary Jane's coffin and returns to his life as Spider-Man.<ref>''Spider-Man: Reign'' #3</ref> After the Six are defeated and the WEBB surrounding New York is destroyed, Peter visits Mary Jane's grave, assuring her that he will be with her again some day, but, for now, he still has his responsibility.<ref>''Spider-Man: Reign'' #4</ref>\n\n=== ''Spectacular Spider-Man'' magazine ===\nIn the [[UK]] based ''Spectacular Spider-Man'' Magazine, which is aimed at considerably younger readers, Mary Jane is Peter's love interest, but possesses no existing knowledge of his dual identity.

Through unknown means she is eventually returned to the side of Spider-Man (now dubbed 'Patient Zero') and joins his tribe, despite not being infected. After a few years she becomes pregnant with Patient Zero's child; late in her pregnancy she is abducted by the Kingpin and taken hostage. Patient Zero sends the Punisher to rescue her, but he is captured and tortured for the location of Patient Zero. Mary Jane threatens to kill herself so that she will not reveal Patient Zero's location, but the Kingpin calls her bluff. Eventually Deadpool creates a distraction that allows her to free Punisher, who annihilates all of the cannibals and kills Kingpin. Mary Jane is reunited with Patient Zero, but is left distraught when Punisher kills him. Grieving, she is sent away from Manhattan by Punisher.<ref>''Punisher Kills the Marvel Universe'' (November 1995).</ref>\n\n=== Age of X ===\nWhen the Anti-Mutant group known as the Human Coalition decided to also target the Mutates, Peter send his pregnant wife Mary Jane away to France in order to ensure her safety.<ref>''Age of X Universe'' #1.

In this continuity, Mary Jane is the most popular girl at Midtown High (her high school in Queens, NY) and even has the title of [[homecoming queen]]. She is briefly infatuated with Spider-Man and the two go on a date. After their date, she realizes that she would much rather be with Peter Parker. The ongoing series was preceded by two four-issue [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]], ''[[Mary Jane (comic)|Mary Jane]]'' and ''[[Mary Jane: Homecoming]]'', intended to appeal to female [[manga]] readers and the fans of the Mary Jane novels.{{issue|date=February 2013}}\n\n=== ''Spider-Man: Fairy Tales'' ===\nIssue #1 of ''Spider-Man: Fairy Tales'' mimics the fairy tale of [[Little Red Riding Hood]]. In this version of the fairy tale, Mary Jane's character mimics that of Little Red Riding Hood, and [[Spider-Man|Peter]] is one of the woodsmen. Peter is not very strong but he is fast, agile, and \"can climb better than most anyone.\" Working together, Peter and Mary Jane manage to kill the evil wolf. The two later become engaged.\n\nIn issue #4, a gender-reversed version of [[Cinderella]], Mary Jane is a servant girl in the house of [[Green Goblin|Sir Osborn]], and is in love with Peter Parker.

In 1977, Mary Jane is Harry Osborn's fianc\u00e9e and runs a discoth\u00e8que called \"Studio 54.\" When Peter attends one night to support her, she drunkenly lashes out at him for not taking action in his personal life after he questions her relationship with Harry, revealing that she knew Peter was Spider-Man in the process. A year later, Harry breaks up with her and leaves her with a massive fortune after he accidentally killed Peter's wife, Gwen Stacy. After Peter and Gwen's clones leave New York to begin a new life, she comforts Peter in his apartment.\n\nBy 1984, she is now married to Peter and gave birth to two twins named Benjamin and Claire. She grows intolerable of Peter's absences as Spider-Man as she takes care of the twins and the elderly May around the time where Peter acquires the black suit. After Peter nearly lets the symbiote take over him while attacking Kraven, she leaves him and takes the twins with her. For the next 11 years, she raises the twins as a single mother in Portland while Peter continues to be CEO of Parker Industries and Spider-Man in New York. After he allows his clone Ben Reilly to take over his life in 1995, he returns to her and the children.\n\nIn 2006, Peter returns to New York shortly after Morlun kills Ben to draw the vampire out to him and prevent Tony Stark from taking over his company.

After Benjamin deduces that Morlun is vulnerable when feeding off life force, he allows Morlun to briefly feed of him to protect his mother and allow Claire the chance to impale the vampire on a tree. While he survived the encounter, Morlun's attack cripples him for life. In 2019, Mary Jane and their children say goodbye to Peter for the last time before he goes into space and sacrifices himself to save the world from Doctor Doom's reign.

Originally known as \"Mary\" to her friends, she later picks up the \"MJ\" nickname. Unlike the original MJ, Ultimate Mary Jane is a brilliant student and expresses her true feelings instead of masquerading as a party girl. She has an eruptive temper and has even physically attacked some of the bullies at her school, resulting in a detention. At one time, MJ had expressed her wish to become an actress, then a \"teacher who cares\". She now has an interest in journalism. She and Peter begin dating in ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #13. In that issue she becomes the second person to learn of Peter's secret identity and the first Peter reveals it to. She mends Peter's spare Spider-Man costumes, once calling herself the [[Betsy Ross]] of superheroes. Although Peter and MJ love each other very much, Peter's Spider-Man identity places a strain on their relationship. The relationship is further complicated when [[Gwen Stacy#Ultimate Marvel|Gwen Stacy]] enters their lives.{{issue|date=February 2013}}\n\nLater, Peter began to fear for Mary Jane's safety more than ever when the [[Alternative versions of Green Goblin#Ultimate Marvel|Green Goblin]] kidnaps her and flings her off the [[Queensboro Bridge]] in a twisted attempt to gain Peter's allegiance. MJ survives, but the experience leaves her traumatized. She later grows angry and jealous when she believes that a new girl, Gwen Stacy, has feelings for Peter. MJ ends their relationship in issue #32, although the pair soon reconciles in issue #41. When MJ's father reads her diary and finds her referring to something as the \"bridge incident\", he tells MJ that she is not allowed to see Peter anymore. Furious, she runs away to an old factory but Peter finds her. MJ's parents separate soon after.{{issue|date=February 2013}}\n\nIn the ''Hobgoblin'' arc (#72-78), it was revealed that Harry and Mary Jane engaged in a brief romance around the same time Peter was bitten.

After realizing his life as a superhero will always endanger MJ, Peter ends their relationship in issue #77. Shortly thereafter, Mary Jane goes out with a character named [[Molten Man#Ultimate Marvel|Mark Raxton]]. After one date, however, she changes her mind, resolving instead to prove herself to Peter and to get him back. When Raxton asks what MJ finds so special about Parker, she simply replies \"Everything\". She has since shown difficulty in moving on from Peter and in dealing with the state of their friendship, especially after Peter has dated [[Alternative versions of Kitty Pryde#Ultimate Marvel|Kitty Pryde]], but Peter has shown an interest in reconciling their differences, and becoming friends again.{{issue|date=February 2013}}\n\nAs part of the ''[[Clone Saga#Ultimate Marvel|Clone Saga]]'' arc, MJ is kidnapped from her bedroom by [[Kaine Parker#Ultimate Marvel|a facially disfigured clone of Peter Parker]] who is determined to give her powers so that she is no longer in danger from his enemies.

Upon learning this, she becomes very angry and transforms into a huge, red, goblin-type creature (referred to by Bendis as Ultimate [[Demogoblin#Other versions|Demogoblin]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.606studios.com/bendisboard/showthread.php?t=90899&page=3 |title=No Ultimate Spider-Man #101 thread?

When the real Peter Parker and [[Ultimate Spider-Woman|Spider-Woman]] show up, she calms down and resumes her original form, just in time for Peter to render his clone unconscious. MJ is taken to the [[Fantastic Four#Ultimate Marvel|Fantastic Four's]] [[Baxter Building]] and when she wakes up, she is afraid and angry, causing another transformation. She spots the Peter clone who is in the building, calms down once again and reverts to her normal self. She is then given what is believed to be a cure for the effects of the OZ formula.{{issue|date=February 2013}}\n\nDuring the epilogue of the ''Clone Saga'' arc, Peter and MJ rekindle their romance, much to Kitty's dismay. Although MJ seems physically cured,<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #105</ref> her ordeal has left her badly traumatized, and she suffers from panic attacks and is haunted by the scarred visage of Peter's disfigured clone. [[Alternative versions of Invisible Woman#Ultimate Marvel|Sue Storm]] suggests that Peter keep a close eye on MJ and seek a psychiatrist to help her. In issue #107, MJ sees Peter talking to Kitty and it angers her. Her hand starts to tremble and her fingernails briefly become claws but she calms down, indicating that her cure might not be permanent or complete, but was never explored further. In issue #112, it is seen that Mary Jane daydreams a scene where she fights against Spider-Man and [[Ultimate Fantastic Four|the Fantastic Four]] in her mutated form.{{issue|date=February 2013}}\n\nMary Jane decides to actively pursue a career in [[broadcast journalism]], and she begins a series of on-location webcast reports in New York with Peter as her cameraman. She constantly messes up her surname, causing her to lose her temper, much to Peter's amusement. She eventually helps Kitty Pryde track down Peter when he is captured and unmasked by [[Shocker (comics)#Ultimate Marvel|The Shocker]].{{issue|date=February 2013}}\n\nIn ''Death of a Goblin'', when Spider-Man asks why they cannot cure Harry and Norman, one of the [[S.H.I.E.L.D.#Ultimate Marvel|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agents tells Peter that the cure for OZ does not work.{{issue|date=February 2013}} Later Mary-Jane's hand starts to transform, though she controls it.{{issue|date=October 2020}}\n\nThe third ''Ultimate Spider-Man Annual'' deals with what is described as a \"heavily controversial topic\". Fans have speculated that this will prove to be Peter and MJ exploring a sexual relationship despite their young age; thus far, the only hints of sexual intercourse have been brief encounters interrupted by changes in circumstance (e.g., Aunt May bursting into the room before they can kiss) and an attempt by [[Alternative versions of Wolverine#Ultimate Marvel|Wolverine]] to make some sort of advance to her when he was briefly trapped in Peter's body. However, by the end of the story, Peter, despite knowing that he and MJ love each other, knew that they are not ready to go to the next level of their relationship, so the idea is postponed. That issue shows that Mary Jane has a knack as a detective, as she figured out that a police officer was on the take from someone, whom the [[NYPD]] has dubbed \"[[Mysterio#Ultimate Marvel|Mysterio]]\", and has the crooked cop set up surveillance equipment at the police department after Peter informed MJ of the police chase. Mysterio later escapes, but not before vowing to get even with Spider-Man.{{issue|date=February 2013}}\n\nIn the six months since the events of ''Ultimatum'', Peter and Mary Jane have once again broken up and become estranged. Mary Jane especially has become withdrawn and consumed in her work for the school webcast. Although Peter was now in a relationship with Gwen Stacy, he and MJ started to repair their friendship. Gwen eventually broke up with Peter, realizing he loved MJ more. Her appearance has also drastically changed as she now has much shorter hair and wears glasses. She would gradually ditch this look as she and Peter reunited as a couple. Peter would later seemingly perish in battle with Norman Osborn and the Sinister Six while saving his Aunt May's life. Mary Jane contemplated writing a tell-all expos\u00e9 on how Fury had failed Peter after his death, but abandoned the idea when she saw Fury's genuine remorse at how he had failed to protect Peter.{{issue|date=February 2013}}\n\nWhen the Peter Parker of Earth-616 [[Spider-Men|briefly crossed into the Ultimate universe]], Gwen called Mary Jane to inform her about his presence, but even after seeing the older Peter leave the house, MJ was unable to bring herself to talk to him, running away when Peter noticed her.<ref>''Spider-Men'' #4 (August 2012)</ref>\n\nIt is eventually revealed that Peter somehow survived his fateful ordeal, waking up in an abandoned lab in San Francisco. Peter made his way back to New York and reunited with Mary Jane. The two dug up his grave to find no body in the casket. After reuniting with Aunt May and Gwen, and meeting up with [[Miles Morales]], Peter helped his successor confront Norman Osborn, who indicated his OZ formula had effectively granted any infused with it immortality, himself and Peter included. Upon defeating Osborn, Peter elects to leave New York, with Mary Jane deciding to travel with him, and the two depart the city in her family car.{{issue|date=October 2020}}\n\nDuring the ''[[Secret Wars (2015)]]'' event and the tie-in ''Ultimate End'', the Ultimate Universe was destroyed by a reality-breaking Incursion and formed part of the patchwork planet [[Battleworld]]. Despite appearances from Miles, 616 Peter, Ganke, Gwen and Aunt May, both Ultimate Peter and Mary Jane are absent from the story.{{issue|date=October 2020}}\n\nAt the conclusion of the 2017 event ''[[Spider-Men II]]'', it is revealed that the Ultimate Universe had been restored to the multiverse and that Peter has returned to New York with Mary Jane and had now fully reestablished himself as Spider-Man ([[Miles Morales]] having been integrated into Earth 616 history following the events of ''[[Secret Wars]]''). Mary Jane makes a brief appearance contacting Peter to let him know he is late for a party.{{issue|date=October 2020}}\n\n=== ''King-Sized Spider-Man Summer Special'' ===\nMary-Jane plays a starring role in ''Un-Enchanted Evening'', a 23-page out-of-continuity short story in the ''King-Sized Spider-Man Summer Special''. In the tale, MJ and her friends [[Millie the Model]] and [[Patsy Walker]] accidentally end up in the middle of a plot by [[Enchantress (Marvel Comics)|Enchantress]] to kidnap and brainwash [[Clea]], [[She-Hulk]], [[Jean Grey]], [[Scarlet Witch]], and Patsy, turning them into her personal army.

Peter communicates with MJ as he battles a new, younger Vulture, the two sharing a bit of banter, before Peter cuts her off to prevent a mugging. Mary Jane continues to wait for Peter until the restaurant prepares to close, she then learns on the news that Peter was shot while preventing the mugging and left for dead. She heads out to the hospital where she finds a great deal of New York have paid Peter a visit to show their gratitude. Mary Jane finally gets her turn to see him and they flirt some more before sharing a kiss, Mary Jane whispers something in Peter's ear, which Peter interprets as all the times she's saved him. Peter later leaves the ward to prevent another mugging, with Mary Jane angrily telling him to get back to bed. The medical staff all figure out that they are married, but are advised not to confirm it outright.  Mary Jane and Peter return to their apartment that they share with their pet dog Daily, where Mary Jane admits to Peter that she ate his birthday cake, just as she does every year. <ref>Amazing Fantasy#1000</ref>\n\n== In other media ==\n=== Television ===\n[[File:Mary Jane Watson TAS.jpg|thumb|Mary Jane Watson in <br>''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man: The Animated Series]]'']]\n* Mary Jane Watson appeared in the 1960s ''[[Spider-Man (1967 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'' episode \"The Big Brainwasher\", voiced by [[Peg Dixon]].

film series]]. Based on the [[Mary Jane Watson|character of the same name]], she is portrayed by [[Kirsten Dunst]]. In the films, Mary Jane is [[Peter Parker (Sam Raimi film series)|Peter Parker]]'s [[girl next door|next-door neighbor]], childhood crush, and primary love interest. Though Mary Jane dates several other men in the first two films, she ultimately falls in love with Peter and Spider-Man and discovers they are one and the same. Despite his strong feelings for her, Peter initially declines a relationship with her in order to keep her safe, but they eventually become a couple in the end.\n\nDespite being portrayed as a [[damsel in distress]] throughout the film series, Dunst's interpretation of the character has been generally well-received.\n\n==Character design and portrayal==\n===Comic book origins===\n[[Mary Jane Watson]] was first introduced into [[Spider-Man]] comics story-lines in ''The Amazing Spider-Man #42'' in 1966, despite being mentioned earlier in the comics.<ref name=\"TheAmazing\" /> She was conceived as competition to [[Gwen Stacy]] as Spider-Man's primary love interest, and is characterized as a free-spirited, outgoing personality as opposed to Gwen's more serious, academic nature. Peter Parker initially dates Gwen after he stops going out with Mary Jane due to what he sees as her shallow personality while Mary Jane refuses to be tied down in one relationship. Despite this, Mary Jane became more popular with fans and following Gwen's [[The Night Gwen Stacy Died|death in the comics]], Peter and MJ begin to rekindle their relationship and eventually marry despite ups and downs in the comics.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Mary Jane Or Gwen Stacy: Who Should Spider-Man Be With? |url=https://vocal.media/geeks/mary-jane-or-gwen-stacy-who-should-spider-man-be-with |access-date=2020-08-24 |website=Geeks|first=Alex|last=Hodgson |archive-date=2020-08-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200826025821/https://vocal.media/geeks/mary-jane-or-gwen-stacy-who-should-spider-man-be-with |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===Casting and execution===\nActress [[Kirsten Dunst]] was cast as Mary Jane Watson for the 2002 Spider-Man film, with Mary Jane having been cemented in comics lore as Peter Parker's primary love interest by then.

She runs with the stereotypical popular crowd in school, being surrounded by people who have enticing physical features and great skills in ways of performing arts or sports. Mary Jane is somewhat naive, but always knows what's going on. While individuals in MJ's high school clique are rude, snobbish, arrogant, vain and uncaring, Mary Jane is a loyal friend and a warm individual, capable of intense love and real feelings. Mary Jane does not let the attention she gets from boys get to her head. Instead, she uses her looks merely as an advantage for acting and modelling and works to develop independence and smarts. Despite her popularity, MJ struggles with insecurity and an urge to impress people she deems important, both of which most likely come from her abusive father, and is an indecisive dater before Peter finally commits to her. She also deals with the harsh reality of being an actress and has her own struggles in each film.<ref name=\"Spidey Films vol. 1\">{{cite news|first=Richard|last=George|title=Spider-Man in Film Volume One|publisher=IGN|date=April 19, 2007|url=http://uk.comics.ign.com/articles/782/782199p1.html|access-date=June 7, 2007|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328144530/http://uk.comics.ign.com/articles/782/782199p1.html|archive-date=March 28, 2012}}</ref>\n\nShe never bullies or judges Peter Parker and is friendly towards him, despite him being in the unpopular crowd, and even flirts with him and calls him \"Tiger\" (an homage to her catchphrase in the comics).<ref name=\"TheAmazing\">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #42 (November 1966)</ref> MJ generally has no one treat her with respect for anything other than her looks, which she may not have noticed until after high school graduation, before she and Peter develop a stronger friendship. It is quite possibly because of this, Mary Jane becomes so smitten by Spider-Man so quickly and later falls for Peter (oblivious that they are one and the same) as he is very kind to her other than just for her looks. After her kiss with Spider-Man, MJ was shown to be a great deal happier and almost ecstatic, because it had perhaps been her first kiss with someone who loved her back for more than just aesthetic reasons.<ref name=\"Spidey Films vol. 1\" /> Unfortunately, her involvement with Spider-Man also makes her a common target by his enemies, making her require his rescue in all three films, as noted by Emily Kubincanek of ''[[Film School Rejects]]''.<ref name=\"FilmRejects\">{{Cite web |last=Kubincanek |first=Emily |date=2017-07-11 |title=The Cinematic Evolution of Spider-Man's Love Interests |url=https://filmschoolrejects.com/cinematic-evolution-spider-mans-love-interests/ |access-date=2020-09-04 |website=Film School Rejects |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nWriting in 2020 after the release of ''[[Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse]]'', Adadora Asidianya of ''CBR.com'' looked back at Mary Jane's live-action portrayal in the Raimi films and noted that she provides a grounding presence for Peter in the films, also commending her positive outlook in life despite her toxic upbringings.<ref name=\"CBR 2020\">{{Cite web |last=Asidianya |first=Adadora |date=2020-07-01 |title=Spider-Man: 10 Things We Should've Seen From Mary Jane In Into The Spider-Verse |url=https://www.cbr.com/mary-jane-spider-verse-film-missing/ |access-date=2020-08-25 |website=CBR |language=en-US |archive-date=2020-08-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200826025818/https://www.cbr.com/mary-jane-spider-verse-film-missing/ |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n===''Spider-Man'' (2002)===\n{{main|Spider-Man (2002 film)}}\nMary Jane first appears as [[Peter Parker (Sam Raimi film series)|Peter Parker]] narrates the first few minutes of the film. She is depicted as a popular girl at [[Midtown High School (comics)|Midtown High School]] and the ex-girlfriend of star athlete [[Flash Thompson]], while Peter, her next-door neighbor who has had a crush on her since they were in first grade, is an academically gifted but shy outsider. Peter struggles to catch the school bus until MJ asks the driver to stop for him. Later, their class attends a field trip to a lab at [[Columbia University]]. Peter's friend [[Harry Osborn (Sam Raimi film series)|Harry Osborn]] flirts with MJ before Peter takes a picture of her for the school newspaper, after which a genetically-altered spider bites him, ultimately giving him his abilities. Peter then saves Mary Jane from slipping in the school cafeteria with his new abilities the next day and inadvertently triggers a fight with Flash, though he is able to easily dodge Flash's punches and knocks him out with one punch. Peter later apologizes to MJ for the fight while she confides in him about wanting to escape her abusive, alcoholic father and pursue an acting career.\n\nShe breaks up with Flash during high school graduation and takes up work as a waitress while looking for acting gigs. While Mary Jane starts dating Harry, she and Peter begin to form a closer friendship. Peter rescues her as Spider-Man when the [[Norman Osborn (Sam Raimi film series)|Green Goblin]] attacks a parade she was attending with Harry, and again later on from a gang in an alley. Mary Jane thanks Spider-Man with a kiss without him revealing his identity. MJ grows distant from Harry due to his desire to please his father, Norman, at her expense and also subsequently develops feelings for Peter when she realizes how much he cares for her, causing Harry to break up with MJ upon seeing her and Peter holding hands.\n\nNorman, who is the Green Goblin and has deduced Peter is Spider-Man, kidnaps Mary Jane upon realizing Peter loves her, thanks to his son's unwitting confession. The Goblin forces Peter to choose between saving Mary Jane and a [[Roosevelt Island Tramway]] car full of children, all of whom he holds hostage on top of the [[Queensboro Bridge]]. Spider-Man opts to save both, and despite a struggle, manages to lower MJ and the kids onto a boat, after which the Goblin whisks Spider-Man away for a final confrontation which results in the Goblin's death. At Norman's funeral, Mary Jane tells Peter that she loves him and they kiss. Peter, who decides that for her protection they can't be together, gently rejects her and insists they can only be friends. As he leaves, a saddened Mary Jane realizes that her kiss with Peter reminds her of the one she shared with Spider-Man and suspects that he is the superhero.\n\n===''Spider-Man 2'' (2004)===\n{{main|Spider-Man 2}}\nTwo years after the events of the first movie, Mary Jane has found success as a model and [[Off-Broadway]] actress. Maintaining her friendships with both Peter and Harry, she continues to pine for Peter, but as he continues to reject her, she starts dating astronaut [[John Jameson (comics)|John Jameson]], the son of Peter's boss [[J. Jonah Jameson (film character)|J. Jonah Jameson]]. Struggling to balance his vigilantism as Spider-Man with his personal life, Peter fails to make it to one of Mary Jane's performances of ''[[The Importance of Being Earnest]]''.\n\nFed up with being Spider-Man and after losing his powers, Peter tosses his suit away and is able to handle his job and studies and decides to pursue MJ, though she pushes him away when John proposes to her. After Mary Jane kisses John, in a manner that is reminiscent of the upside-down kiss between her and Spider-Man from the first film, she realizes that she does not love John and still wants a relationship with Peter. Later, she meets Peter in a coffee shop where she asks for a kiss to confirm her belief that he is Spider-Man. She even asks him if he loves her which he falsely replies, \"I don't\", for the sake of his superhero responsibilities and her safety. Before they can kiss, [[Otto Octavius (film character)|Doctor Octopus]] attacks the cafe, kidnapping Mary Jane.\n\nPeter regains his abilities and takes up being the web-slinger once more, fighting Doc Ock on a runaway [[New York City Subway]] train before being subdued and delivered to Harry, who wants revenge on Spider-Man for allegedly killing his father. After Harry unmasks Peter, he reluctantly provides Doc Ock's and Mary Jane's location so Peter can save her. Peter defeats Doctor Octopus this time as the latter tries to create a fusion reactor capable of destroying the city, and unmasks himself to both Doctor Octopus and MJ, confirming her suspicions that Peter and Spider-Man are in fact one and the same. Peter finally confesses his love for MJ, rescuing her as Doctor Octopus regains control of himself from the malicious AI in his tentacles and repents of his prior actions, sacrificing himself to destroy the reactor. Peter explains his reasoning for not being with her, then allows her to reunite with John. However, MJ leaves John at the altar during their wedding and runs to Peter's apartment, stating that she is willing to accept any risks that come with being in a relationship with Peter. The two finally become a couple, and Mary Jane sees Peter off as he swings into action as Spider-Man to help out a situation, uttering her catchphrase ''\"Go get 'em, Tiger!\"''\n\n===''Spider-Man 3'' (2007)===\n{{main|Spider-Man 3}}\nHaving dated Peter for one year, Mary Jane experiences some struggles in her personal life, losing her [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] role because of bad reviews and experiencing friction with her boyfriend when an [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|alien symbiote]] takes him over and brings out the darker parts of his personality which as a result makes him distance himself from her to focus on capturing and killing his uncle's actual killer, [[Flint Marko]].<ref name=\"web\">{{cite magazine|first=Steve|last=Daly |title=World Wide Web |page=3 |magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=April 17, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070422201143/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0%2C%2C20035326_3%2C00.html |url=https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20035326_3,00.html |access-date=April 20, 2007 |archive-date=April 22, 2007 |url-status=dead}}</ref> She also faces competition for Peter's affections in the form of his lab partner [[Gwen Stacy]]. After she confides in Harry about her problems, Harry, who had suffered [[amnesia]] from a prior fight with Peter as the New Goblin, regains his memories after they unwittingly kiss and frightens MJ into breaking up with Peter, setting up a second confrontation between the two former friends which leaves Harry's face disfigured.\n\nPeter, now under more influence from the symbiote, later brings Gwen to a jazz club where MJ has found work in an attempt to make her jealous, though Gwen catches on and apologizes to Mary Jane. He then gets into a fight with the club's bouncers and unintentionally hits Mary Jane, leading him to realize what the symbiote suit has turned him into. He leaves and disposes of the symbiote suit, which unintentionally falls onto [[Eddie Brock]], Gwen's failed suitor and Peter's bitter rival and fellow photographer, to create Venom. Brock, who also holds a grudge on Peter for having him fired for defaming Spider-Man and stealing his girlfriend, finds out his secret identity, teaming up with Flint Marko to lure and kill Spider-Man, capturing MJ as bait, though she is able to protect herself this time. The subsequent battle pits Spider-Man and the New Goblin (who no longer begrudges Peter after discovering the truth about his father's death) against Venom and the Sandman; the two villains are defeated, but Harry loses his life in the process, dying with MJ and Peter at his side after taking a blade intended for Peter.\n\nSometime after Harry's funeral, Peter arrives at MJ's jazz club, and the two begin to mend their relationship, sharing a dance.<!-- DO NOT ADD A SECTION FOR NO WAY HOME-->{{efn|After Peter is temporarily transported to [[Marvel Cinematic Universe|an alternate reality]] during the events of the [[Marvel Studios]] film ''[[Spider-Man: No Way Home]]'', he reveals his relationship with Mary Jane remains \"complicated\" before adding the two worked it out \"after a long time\".}}\n\n==In other media==\n===Television===\n*Mary Jane also appears in ''[[Spider-Man: The New Animated Series]]'', a [[computer-generated imagery|CGI]]-animated television series serving as a loose alternate continuation of the first ''Spider-Man'' film.
