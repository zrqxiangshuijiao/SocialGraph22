A [[Skrull]] impersonator of Equinox appeared in ''Avengers: The Initiative'' #12 (June 2008) and #18.\n\nEquinox received an entry in the ''[[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe|All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z]]'' #4 (2006).\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nEquinox is an African-American youth who gained superhuman powers due to accidental exposure to his father's malfunctioning equipment after a lab accident (his mother is Margay Sorenson, head of [[natural sciences]] at [[Bard College]]).<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #60 (Aug. 1977)</ref>\n\nEquinox's powers were similar to the combined abilities of superheroes the [[Human Torch]] and [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]], with whom he first battled,<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #23</ref> as well as enhanced strength and durability. He engages in conflict with the superheroes [[Spider-Man]], [[Henry Pym|Yellowjacket]], and the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]], during which his origin was revealed, the three heroes managing to apparently cure him using technology conceived by his mother and constructed in the [[Baxter Building]] while the [[Fantastic Four]] were away.<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #59-60 (July\u2013Aug. 1977)</ref>\n\nYears later, he fights the [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]].<ref>''Marvel Comics Presents'' #147</ref> Afterwards, Equinox joined Vil-Anon, a twelve-step program dedicated to helping individuals overcome their criminal tendencies.<ref>''Spider-Man Unlimited'' vol. 2 #12</ref>\n\nEquinox appears during the ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'' event, and when the registration law is announced, he wants to leave the country again. He contacts [[Vienna (comics)|Vienna]] to make him a new fake identity, but unbeknownst to him, Vienna  secretly works for [[Heroes for Hire]] who  apprehend Equinox and several other supervillains.<ref>''Heroes for Hire'' vol. 2 #1</ref>\n\nEquinox is next seen as a member of the [[Montana]] team of the [[Fifty State Initiative]], [[Freedom Force (comics)|Freedom Force]], alongside [[Challenger (comics)|Challenger]], [[Cloud 9 (comics)|Cloud 9]], Think Tank, and Spinner.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #12</ref>\n\nDuring the ''[[Secret Invasion]]'' storyline, Equinox was revealed to be a [[Skrull]] infiltrator and attacked his teammates. The Skrull-Equinox not only had the abilities of [[Firestar (Marvel Comics)|Firestar]] and Iceman to match the real Equinox' powers, he also had some of Spider-Man's abilities. He froze [[Hardball (comics)|Hardball]], Ryder and Riot (of the [[Skrull Kill Krew]]) in ice and broke the glass over Think Tank's brain. The Skrull-Equinox was sniped in the head by [[Cloud 9 (comics)|Cloud 9]] using adamantium bullets.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #18</ref>\n\nAfter the invasion is over, the real Equinox is seen, although miscolored, in a support group meeting with the others that had been replaced by Skrulls.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #20</ref> Equinox has since retaken active service with the Freedom Force. Due to his criminal past, Norman Osborn chooses his team between the ones assembled by Stark to help some other Initiative teams to apprehend the seceding Heavy Hitters team.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #28</ref>\n\nAt the start of the ''[[Ends of the Earth (Marvel Comics)|Ends of the Earth]]'' storyline, Equinox is on a rampage. To defeat him, Spider-Man uses his own version of [[Green Goblin]]'s glider and bombs.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #682</ref>\n\nFollowing the ''[[Avengers vs. X-Men]]'' storyline, Equinox participates in a prison riot. [[Mimic (comics)|Mimic]] and [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] respond to the riot. Copying the powers of Equinox, [[Armadillo (comics)|Armadillo]], and [[Man-Bull]], Mimic and Rogue stop the riot.<ref>''X-Men: Legacy'' #275</ref>\n\nEquinox returns in the ''[[All-New, All-Different Marvel]]'' when he is brainwashed by [[Kang the Conqueror]]'s splintered half [[Mister Gryphon]] to attack the Avengers. Mister Gryphon creates multiple temporal replicas of Equinox by having his future selves aid him in his assault.<ref>''All-New, All-Different Avengers'' #5</ref> However, he is defeated when [[Spider-Man (Miles Morales)|Spider-Man]] pretends to be under Kang's influence so that he can identify the earliest version of Equinox present as the only one surprised at his conversion and then knock him out, eliminating all the future Equinoxes as well.<ref>''All-New, All-Different Avengers'' #6</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nEquinox possesses both pyrokinesis and cryokinesis as well as superhuman strength and durability. He continually undergoes \"thermal transitions\" so that part of his body is always aflame and part of his body is covered with ice. The strain of these powers has driven him increasingly insane over time.{{issue|date=December 2011}}\n\n==In other media==\n\n===Video games===\n* Equinox appears in ''[[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance 2]]'', voiced by [[Jimmie Wood]]. He is shown injected with a controlling nanite and unleashed upon the heroes when they infiltrate Prison 42.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.marvel.com/universe/Equinox Equinox] at Marvel.com\n* {{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/equinoxs.htm|Equinox}}\n* [http://www.marveldatabase.com/Equinox Equinox] at Marvel Wiki\n\n{{Ant-Man and Wasp}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Equinox (Comics)}}\n[[Category:Characters created by Gil Kane]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Len Wein]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1974]]\n[[Category:Fictional African-American people]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters with fire or heat abilities]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters with ice or cold abilities]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters with superhuman strength]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]"}]}}}}
