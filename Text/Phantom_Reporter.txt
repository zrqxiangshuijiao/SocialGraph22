He had no known superpowers until he inherited the powers of the hero known as [[Fiery Mask]].\n\n==Publication history==\n{{expand-section|date=April 2020}}\nFor several decades, the character's only appearance was in ''[[Daring Mystery Comics]]'' #3, published by [[Timely Comics]], the forerunner to Marvel Comics, during the period known to fans and historians as the [[Golden Age of Comic Books]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Nevins |first1=Jess |title=Encyclopedia of Golden Age Superheroes |date=2013 |publisher=High Rock Press |isbn=978-1-61318-023-5 |page=207}}</ref>\n\nHe appears in ''[[The Twelve (comic)|The Twelve]]''.<ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/news/newsitem.cgi?id=11312 Mystery Men's Dozen: Brevoort Talks \"The Twelve\"], July 26, 2007, [[Comic Book Resources]]</ref><ref>[http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=125392 12 Days of the Twelve: The Phantom Reporter] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929123702/http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=125392 |date=2007-09-29 }}, August 15, 2007, [[Newsarama]]</ref> His one Golden Age story has been reprinted in ''The Twelve'' #0.\n\nHis origin was told in ''Daring Mystery 70th Anniversary Special'', and his Golden Age story was again reprinted.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n\nDick Jones was ex-All American [[Fullback (gridiron football)|fullback]], ex-collegiate boxing, wrestling and fencing champ. He actually has three identities: Dick Jones, reporter; Van Engen, millionaire; and Phantom Reporter, costumed crime fighter. <ref>''Daring Mystery Comics'' #3 (1940)</ref> He put on a mask so he could redress the wrongs he couldn't as a reporter.<ref>''Daring Mystery 70th Anniversary Special'' (2009)</ref>\n\n===The Twelve===\n{{Main|The Twelve (comics)}}\nJones and eleven other heroes, such as [[Blue Blade]], the first Electro and the [[Black Widow (Claire Voyant)|Black Widow]], are in Berlin during the last days of World War 2. The story starts from his perspective. Purely by chance they assemble and investigate the headquarters of the S.S. As part of a plot to reinvigorate the Nazis, they are captured and placed in suspended animation. The scientists responsible are killed in various incidents and the twelve are not found until 2008. \n\nTo reduce the culture shock the government agency recreates life from decades ago. Jones notices oddities, such as a female nurse having earring holes and wearing bizarre stockings. This snaps the illusion for the group.<ref>''The Twelve'' #1 (2008)</ref> \n\nJones also deals with his growing attraction to the Black Widow.\n\nSoon, he is offered a job with the ''[[Daily Bugle]]''. For the editors at the ''Bugle'', the Phantom Reporter's first-hand experience of America's past \u2014 specifically all the good and ill that was present \u2014 will be invaluable to their readers. He accepts the job, writing his first article on the sacrifice and patriotism of his generation of heroes.<ref>''The Twelve'' #3 (2008)</ref> Dying, Fiery Mask transmits his power to him.<ref>The Twelve #11, 2012</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.reocities.com/jjnevins/reporter.html The Phantom Reporter] at [[Jess Nevins|Nevins, Jess]], [http://www.reocities.com/Athens/Olympus/7160/gaguide.html A Guide to Golden Age Marvel Characters].
