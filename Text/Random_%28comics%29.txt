The character was created by writer [[Peter David]] for the series [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]]. He was originally presented as an opponnent of X-Factor, but he later became their reluctant ally.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nThe complete origin of Random is unclear. It appears that he was created from a mass of protoplasm by [[Dark Beast]], making Random the continuation of an experiment that Dark Beast began while [[Mister Sinister|Sinister's]] lead scientist in the [[Age of Apocalypse]] reality. It is also possible that Random was born normally and then captured and experimented on by Dark Beast. Following Dark Beast's experimentation, the young Random is given the name of Alex, and he uses this name while serving as McCoy's helper in the sewers beneath [[New York City]] when he worked with the [[Morlocks (comics)|Morlocks]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}\n\n\"Alex\" eventually escapes, shifting his appearance to that of a muscle-bound man and creating the identity of bounty hunter Random. It is unknown if the name Marshall Evan Stone III is his real name or just a name he created for his new Random persona. According to the memories of Charlie Ronalds, a person with Random's powers killed Charlie's parents when Charlie was very young, though Random has never been confirmed as the killer.<ref>''X-Factor'', vol. 1 Annual #8 (1993)</ref>\n\nIn his first encounter with the government-sponsored [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]] team, Random is called in (presumably by the government) to bring back a group of [[Genosha]]n renegades called the X-Patriots, who refuse to leave a hospital where one of their comrades is being treated. Random and X-Factor clash and, wanting to end the fight quickly, team leader [[Havok (comics)|Havok]] buys out Random's contract.<ref>''X-Factor'', vol. 1 #88 (Mar. 1993)</ref>\n\nBecause of his success as a bounty hunter, Random is contracted to go after X-Factor member [[Polaris (Marvel Comics)|Polaris]]. During their battle, Random tells her that the same government that employs her hired him to kill her. Polaris doesn't believe him, but he assures her that there are mutant haters in the government. After a brief scuffle, Polaris leaves, later confessing to Havok that she felt Random was holding back during the fight, as if he wanted her to win.<ref>''X-Factor'', vol. 1 #95 (Oct. 1993)</ref>\n\n===Joining X-Factor===\nAfter X-Factor encountered the religious fanatic [[Haven (comics)|Haven]], Random visits X-Factor members [[Wolfsbane (comics)|Wolfsbane]] and [[Strong Guy]], confessing to them that the government agents who had previously hired him are now after his life as well. In exchange for protection, he agrees to tell X-Factor who hired him to kill Polaris. The team sets out to find Haven, and [[Forge (comics)|Forge]] hires Random's services against Haven for $15,000 and a new car, so he tags along. When they locate Haven, she transports Random and the rest of X-Factor to a pocket dimension where she shows them how much they really need her. In this world, Random begins to revert to his protoplasmic state, causing Haven to point out that she knows the truth behind his bloodthirsty fa\u00e7ade. When she returns the team to the real world, Random is completely [[gelatin]]ous but quickly pulls himself together and refuses to talk to the team about it.<ref>''X-Factor'', vol. 1 #100 (March 1994)</ref>\n\nFollowing Haven's defeat, Forge pays Random and offers him a permanent job on the team, which he declines. Shortly thereafter, Random, Forge, and Polaris track down Colonel Malone, the man who hired Random to kill Polaris. The trio find him, but he commits suicide before they can question him. However, Malone's assistant informs them that the government never planned on killing Polaris\u2014they only wanted to test her limits as part of their plan to use her as a [[fail-safe]] against [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]].
