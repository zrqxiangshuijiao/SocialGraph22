Cancelled after [[X-Force]] interfered. \n* '''[[Prime Sentinel]]s''' - Created by [[Bastion (comics)|Bastion]] and ''[[Operation: Zero Tolerance]]''. They were at first disabled humans infected with Nano-Sentinel technology at Prospero Clinic under the believe that they were being equipped with cybernetic nanotech implants to replace their lost limbs. Unbeknownst to many of them, they became sleeper agents for Operation: Zero Tolerance, as they would, upon activation by a mutant attack or near the presence of one, transformed into armored beings with powerful weapons systems.\n[[File:Sentinel Marvels Vol 1 2.png|thumbnail|250px|Sentinels in ''Marvels'' #2 (February 1994).

New units are produced based on the currently available resources \u2013 salvaged parts, weapons and sometimes even entire vehicles \u2013 which give this particular type of Sentinel a very diverse, rag-tag appearance. Due to both this and their design flexibility, a wide variety of different shapes and forms have been observed. The Mega-Sentinels used to destroy [[Genosha]] and Nanosentinels both belong to this kind of Sentinel. The technology used in Nano-Sentinels is also employed by [[Weapon Plus]] for their artificial evolution experiments and the creation of their Super-Sentinels.\n* '''Mark VIII''' - Sentinel Squad [[Office of National Emergency|O*N*E]], designed by [[Iron Man|Stark Enterprises]].

In the film, the prototypes are said to be built using space-age polymers and are equipped with chest-mounted vent-like structures that grant flight capabilities as well as arm-mounted Gatling guns while the future Sentinels have become smaller, sleeker, and built with adaptive mechanical scales and hands that can reform into blades. This version of the Sentinel program was originally created in the 1970s, with Bolivar Trask experimenting on mutants to accelerate his research, though he found little success in gaining support for his project. After [[Mystique (character)|Mystique]] assassinated Trask in 1973, the U.S. government approved the Sentinel program, captured Mystique, and experimented on her to give the Sentinels the ability to adapt and utilize mutant powers. However, they subsequently target humans due to their potential for having mutant descendants, culminating in a dystopian future where most of humanity and mutantkind are nearly extinct by 2023. Using [[Kitty Pryde]]'s new ability to project the minds of others into their past selves, the surviving X-Men project [[Logan (film character)|Logan]]'s mind back into his 1973 self to rally [[Charles Xavier (film character)|Charles Xavier]] and [[Magneto (film character)|Erik Lehnsherr]]'s younger selves and avert Trask's assassination. Mystique defeats Lehnsherr, but Xavier and [[Hank McCoy]] convince her not to kill Trask, causing the U.S. government to realize that not all mutants are a threat to humanity and abandon the Sentinel program.\n* The 1973 Sentinels from ''X-Men: Days of Future Past'' make a cameo appearance in ''[[X-Men: Apocalypse]]'' (2016) as Danger Room simulations.\n\n===Video games===\n[[File:Xm-coa.png|right|200px|thumb|Sentinel (right) fighting [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] in ''[[X-Men: Children of the Atom (video game)|X-Men: Children of the Atom]]''.]]\n* The Sentinels appear in the ''[[X-Men (arcade game)|X-Men]]'' arcade game.\n* The Sentinels appear in ''[[Spider-Man/X-Men: Arcade's Revenge]]'' as part of [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]]'s levels.\n* The Sentinels appear as [[boss (video games)|bosses]] in ''[[X-Men: Mutant Apocalypse]]'' as part of the [[Genosha]] stage.\n* The Sentinels appear in ''[[X-Men 2: Clone Wars]]''.\n* A non-standard 10' tall Sentinel appears as a [[player character|playable character]] in ''[[X-Men: Children of the Atom (video game)|X-Men: Children of the Atom]]''.\n* A non-standard 10' tall Sentinel appears as a secret assist character in ''[[Marvel vs. Capcom: Clash of Super Heroes]]''.\n* A non-standard 10' tall Sentinel appears as a playable character in ''[[Marvel vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes]]''.\n* The Sentinels appear in ''[[X-Men: Mutant Academy]]'' as part of Cyclops's intro.\n* The Sentinels appear as background characters in ''[[X-Men: Mutant Academy 2]]''.\n* The Sentinels appear in ''[[X-Men: Next Dimension]]'', with a male and female Prime Sentinel available as playable characters.\n* The Sentinels appear in ''[[X-Men Legends]]'' , voiced by [[Scott MacDonald (actor)|Scott MacDonald]].<ref name=\"btva\"/> This version of the Sentinel program includes regular Sentinels, Sentinel Alpha, a Sentinel Controller, a Sentinel Weapons Platform, and a Sentinel Advanced.\n* The Sentinels appear in ''[[X-Men Legends II: Rise of Apocalypse]]''.\n* The Sentinels appear in ''[[X-Men: The Official Game]]''.
