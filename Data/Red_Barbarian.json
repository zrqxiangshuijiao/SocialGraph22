The duo scheme to steal the secret [[disintegrator ray]] [[blueprint]]s of Tony Stark. The Actor is sent to impersonate Stark and get the plans. The Actor succeeds in doing so, through the means of changing from disguise to disguise, and even learns the [[secret identity]] of Iron Man. However, Iron Man manages to get back the classified papers from The Actor and he in return impersonates The Actor impersonating Iron Man and rushes to meet the Red Barbarian. The general is tricked and believes that Iron Man is The Actor in disguise. When he demands for the blueprints, Iron Man replies that the suitcase (in which the blueprints are supposedly in) is [[booby-trapped]] and it can only be opened four hours later, and then leaves. Just then, The Actor returns. The Red Barbarian thinks he is the imposter and shoots him, before he can tell the general Iron Man's secret identity.\n\n===2010s===\nThe Red Barbarian is missing in action for many years, until he is \"revived\" (without a prior [[back story]]), [[Unageing|unaged]] and acting as a [[Prison warden|warden]] (under the name of Colonel Andre Rostov) in the [[gulag]] where [[Bucky Barnes]] is serving time in for killing two [[Russia]]n citizens many years back, and tortured Barnes for the information involving \"Zephyr codes\" for his own profit.<ref>''Captain America'' #616-619 (March-June 2011)</ref> He is seen living a life of luxury in the [[Bahamas]] until he is assassinated by the Winter Soldier.<ref>''Winter Soldier Volume 1: The Longest Winter'' (Part 5 of 5; May 2012)</ref>\n\n==Other versions==\n* The Red Barbarian plays an essential role in the ''Iron Man and the Armor Wars'', a version of the classic [[Armor Wars]] storyline.<ref>''Iron Man and the Armor Wars'' #2</ref><ref>''Iron Man and the Armor Wars'' #3</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}6\n\n==External links==\n* [http://comicbookdb.com/character.php?ID=54813 Red Barbarian] at the Comic Book Database\n*[http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/redbarba.htm Red Barbarian] at the Appendix to the Marvel Handbook\n\n{{Stan Lee}}\n\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1963]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Robert Bernstein]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Don Heck]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Stan Lee]]\n[[Category:Fictional generals]]\n[[Category:Fictional Soviet Army personnel]]\n[[Category:Fictional Russian people]]\n[[Category:Fictional Soviet people]]\n[[Category:Fictional Eastern European people]]"}]}}}}
