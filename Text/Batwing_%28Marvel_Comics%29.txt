Jimmy was lost in the caverns and drank water that \"tasted like metal.\" He was eventually rescued and returned to his mother. Soon the chemicals began to take effect and Jimmy sprouted wings. His mother proclaimed him a [[demon]], causing Jimmy to run away. He continued to mutate into a [[bat]]-like creature and ended up stealing food to survive. He arrived in [[New York City]] and made his home under an old pier. Jimmy began stealing food from people dining on rooftops scaring people in the process. Thus, the people began to dub him Batwing.\n\nWhen New York City [[Councillor|Councilman]] Randolph Cherryh was once dining with his girlfriend, Batwing appeared and stole some of his apples which humiliated Randolph. Randolph Cherryh placed a bounty on him which Peter Parker decided to take part on during his financial problems. Randolph arranged for a party as part of a trap. When Batwing came, the police sprang and began shooting, only for Peter Parker in his alias of [[Spider-Man]] to web up the guns and pursue Batwing. Batwing battled with Spider-Man before fleeing back to where he lived under the pier. When Spider-Man followed Batwing to the pier, he discovered that Batwing was just a scared kid who was stealing food to survive. Spider-Man read some of his history before Jimmy ran off right into the Councilman who secretly followed in his helicopter. Randolph did not care if Batwing was just a youngster, and he was about to kill the boy when Spider-Man webbed down his men. Batwing fled despite Spider-Man's offer to get [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]] or [[Hank Pym]] to help cure him. Randolph vowed to ruin Spider-Man's life before having his mouth webbed and himself being shoved into a garbage can.<ref>''Untold Tales of Spider-Man'' #2</ref>\n\nSpider-Man continued to bring food to Jimmy who still fears people like Randolph Cherryh.<ref>''Untold Tales of Spider-Man'' #7</ref>\n\nSpider-Man later asked Dr. Curt Connors to use his expertise to help cure Jimmy. When an accident causes Connors to become the [[Lizard (comics)|Lizard]] again, Batwing helps Spider-Man track him down and cure Connors. Connors and Jimmy leave New York for someplace quiet where Jimmy can be cured.<ref>''Untold Tales of Spider-Man'' #9</ref>\n\nWhen Connors' cure fails, Batwing returns to New York and battles Spider-Man again. With his father dead and his mother rejecting him, Jimmy hopes for death. Spider-Man locates Jimmy's mother and tells her that Jimmy is still her son, regardless of his condition, and that she was wrong to reject him. Just as Batwing is about to be shot by the [[New York Police Department]], Jimmy's mother intervenes and tells her son that she still loves him. Upon hearing this and knowing that he is loved, Jimmy reverts to his human form, and the police retreat. Jimmy goes home with his mother, finally receiving the love that he desperately needs.<ref>''Untold Tales of Spider-Man'' #24</ref>\n\nAfter the superhero ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'', Batwing enters the [[Fifty State Initiative]] as one of the recruits at [[Camp Hammond (comics)|Camp Hammond]] along with [[Gorilla Girl]], [[Prodigy (Ritchie Gilmore)|Prodigy]], [[Butterball (Emery Schaub)|Butterball]] and others.
