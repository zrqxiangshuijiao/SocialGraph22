Art by [[Jack Kirby]].]]\n'''The Master Mold''' first appeared in ''The X-Men'' #15\u201316 (Dec. 1965\u2013Jan. 1966), and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]].\n\nThe character subsequently appears in ''The Incredible Hulk'' Annual #7 (1978), ''X-Factor'' #13\u201314 (Feb.\u2013March 1987), ''Power Pack'' #36 (April 1988), ''Marvel Comics Presents'' #18\u201324 (May\u2013July 1989), ''The Uncanny X-Men'' #246\u2013247 (July\u2013Aug. 1989), ''The Sensational She-Hulk'' #30 (Aug. 1991), and ''Cyclops: Retribution'' #1 (Jan. 1994).\n\n'''The Master Mold''' received an entry in ''[[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe#Publication history|The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Update '89]]'' #5.\n\n==Fictional Character Biography==\n'''Master Mold''' was created by Dr. [[Bolivar Trask]] during the original run of X-Men comics. In the 1960s, out of fear for a race of superhuman mutants that could dominate the whole world and enslave normal human beings, Trask makes '''Master Mold,''' a super-computer in the shape of a giant [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinel]] robot, that will control and facilitate the construction of the Sentinels which are mechanical warriors programmed to hunt and capture superhuman mutants. Unbeknownst to all, the original '''Master Mold''' is also programmed by the time-traveling Tanya Trask ([[Madame Sanctity]]), part of the Askani Sisterhood, with the mission to find and destroy [[Apocalypse: The Twelve|The Twelve]]: a group of mutants that are linked to the rise of [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]], which the ruthless Sanctity considered an event that must be stopped at all costs.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men Minus 1'' (1997)</ref> For unknown reasons, some of the mutants that are cataloged as the Twelve are not part of the group. '''The Master Mold''' has Trask captured, and decides to take over humanity to keep it safe.{{issue|date=March 2013}}\n\nThe original '''Master Mold''' is eventually destroyed when Trask sacrifices himself by causing an explosion to prevent the Sentinels taking over humanity, but several other '''Master Molds'''' are later built by other people who want to manufacture Sentinels. In the late 1980s, the remains of '''Master Mold''' merges with [[Nimrod (comics)|Nimrod]], an advanced Sentinel from the future, thanks to the [[Siege Perilous (comics)|Siege Perilous]] to form the being called [[Bastion (comics)|Bastion]], which acts like an almost-human Master Mold during the late 1990s and early 2000s.{{issue|date=March 2013}}\n\nAnother '''Master Mold''' appeared in ''The Incredible Hulk'' Annual #7. It claimed to be [[Steven Lang (comics)|Steven Lang]] who was thought to be dead after Project Armageddon. It said that he (as Lang) did not die immediately from the crash of his flying gunship; he managed to pull himself out of the wreckage and crawl to his greatest weapon, Master Mold, which merged with Lang when he tried to activate it. It was nearly destroyed by the [[Hulk]] who was with [[Warren Worthington III|Angel]] and [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]] in Master Mold's meteor space base. It was completely destroyed when the base exploded, after Hulk, Angel, and Iceman managed to escape.{{issue|date=March 2013}}\n\n'''Master Mold''' also claimed the name and identity of Stephen Lang during a story arc ''Marvel Comics Presents'' #17\u201324, later reprinted in the graphic novel ''Cyclops: Retribution'': '''Master Mold''' creates the Retribution Virus, designed to wipe out mutantkind. It blames [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] entirely for its death as Stephen Lang. He hypnotizes [[Moira MacTaggart]] and uses her to unleash the virus, infecting Cyclops, [[Callisto (comics)|Callisto]], and [[Banshee (comics)|Banshee]], who is completely incapacitated. However, MacTaggart breaks free of his grasp. While she attempts to cure the virus, Cyclops and Callisto team with Conscience (another artificial construct developed from Lang's brain engrams) to stop Master Mold and save mutantkind as well as all  humanity, which had become threatened by the virus. Cyclops, though weakened from the effects of the disease, nearly single-handedly destroys the '''Master Mold''' before finally succumbing to his illness and falling unconscious. As '''Master Mold''' prepares to kill Cyclops and finish unleashing the virus, he is suddenly attacked by a cured Banshee who uses his sonic scream to \"finish the job that Cyclops started\" and destroys '''Master Mold'''. The virus is then cured before it has a chance to spread.{{issue|date=March 2013}}\n\nAnother '''Master Mold''' is built in secret in the jungles of [[Ecuador]]. This particular '''Master Mold''' builds a new breed of Sentinels, known as Wild Sentinels, which are capable of assimilating non-organic materials to assume different shapes, most of them insectoid, as well as a breed of Nano-Sentinels. This '''Master Mold''' is taken over by [[Cassandra Nova]] who uses the Wild Sentinels to destroy [[Genosha]] and in her subsequent plan to destroy the X-Men. Following their defeat at the hands of [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]]'s X-Men team, the [[Children of the Vault]] escaped and regrouped in the Ecuadorian '''Master Mold'''.{{issue|date=March 2013}}\n\nIn ''[[X-Men: Second Coming]]'', [[X-Force]] travels to the [[Days of Future Past]] timeline where there are two '''Master Molds''', one of them producing Nimrods and another one protecting the first '''Master Mold'''.{{issue|date=March 2013}}\n\nAfter the latest [[Tri-Sentinel]] was destroyed by an Isotope Genome Accelerator duplicate of [[Spider-Man]], a saddened [[Mendel Stromm]] was approached by a [[Harry Osborn#Kindred|mysterious benefactor]] who began to give him a '''Master Mold''' that specializes in creating Tri-Sentinels.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 5 #4. Marvel Comics.</ref> After the two Spider-Men reunite into one body, Spider-Man was able to take remote control of the Tri-Sentinels and send them back to the '''Master Mold''' base to destroy it.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 5 #5. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nIn ''[[House of X]]'', the Orchis Project, a grouping of Earth scientists centered on human survival in the face of an ascendant Mutant population creates the Mother Mold, a Master Mold variant designed to create other '''Master Molds''''.<ref>''House of X'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> It is later revealed that the Mother Mold will be the Sentinel generation that lead directly to the creation of Nimrod.<ref>''Powers of X'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n==Capabilities==\nDr. Bolivar Trask equipped '''Master Mold''' with powerful weaponry and the ability to speak; Master Mold was also mobile so that it could defend itself from mutant attackers or so that it can be relocated easily if Trask had to find a new headquarters. The Steven Lang Master Molds were also capable of self-repair.\n\n==Other versions==\nThe [[Ultimate Marvel]] Universe equivalent of '''Master Mold''' are two individuals: \n* The first equivalent has a possible future where [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] is used as an original template to create an army of Sentinels which share his personality traits. However, present day [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] and Wolverine discover the mutilated body and he asks them to kill him in order to cease the production.<ref>''Ultimate Fantastic Four/X-Men'' Annual #1</ref> \n* The second equivalent is [[Jason Stryker|William Stryker]]'s mutant power to [[Technopathy|infuse some of his brain patterns]] on the [[Nimrod (comics)|new Sentinels]] to built a giant Sentinel called Master Mold which houses his mind.<ref>''Ultimate Comics: X-Men'' #11</ref>\n\nIn the alternate reality of ''[[Weapon X]]: Days of Future Now'', one of [[Madison Jeffries]]' Boxbots dubbed ''Bot'' becomes the new Master Mold and traps Jeffries within its body in order to use his powers to build new Sentinels without exhausting Jeffries.<ref>''Weapon X: Days of Future Now'' #1</ref>\n\nIn ''[[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]] Forever Master Mold'', '''Master Mold''' is bonded to [[Cameron Hodge]] by Apocalypse to form '''Master Meld'''.<ref>''X-Factor Forever Master Mold''</ref>\n\nIn ''[[What If (comics)|What If?]] Age of Ultron'' series set in an alternative future, Wolverine, the Hulk, Peter Parker and a Ghost Rider travel to the [[Savage Land]] in order to confront an older [[Ezekiel Stane]] using a surviving '''Master Mold''' to reproduce Stark Iron Man armors. Stane uses an unnamed girl, described as an orphan, the sole remaining Trask descendant, and referred to only as 'Ms. Trask', in order to operate the Master Mold that had apparently been left behind in the Savage Land. Seeking to unleash a wave of the armors upon the world, Stane is stopped and this '''Master Mold''' ultimately destroyed.<ref>''What If? Age of Ultron'' #2</ref>\n\n==In other media==\n===Television===\n[[Image:Mastermold2.jpg|Master Mold in the ''X-Men Animated Series''|right|thumb]]\n* Master Mold appears in ''[[X-Men: The Animated Series]]'', voiced by [[David Fox (actor)|David Fox]] in season one and [[Nigel Bennett]] in seasons three and four. During season one, [[Bolivar Trask]] and [[Henry Peter Gyrich]] attempt to develop Master Mold from their [[Genosha]]n facility via a hydro-electric dam. While [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] floods the facility, Trask and Gyrich relocate to a secret [[Washington, D.C.]] facility to complete Master Mold by the season one finale. However, they lose control of him as Master Mold kidnaps [[Robert Kelly (character)|Robert Kelly]] and dozens of world leaders in an attempt to replace their brains with computers and bring them under his control as well as kill humanity upon concluding that they are also mutants, only to be foiled by [[Professor X]] and [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]]. As of season four, it is revealed Master Mold's head survived and commissioned Sentinels to steal top-secret, indestructible, lightweight plastics to create a new body for himself as well as kidnap Trask and Gyrich for betraying him along with Professor X to graft his new body into him and take his powers. The X-Men eventually rescue the captives while [[Morph (comics)|Morph]] seemingly destroys Master Mold's head. In a possible dystopian future, Master Mold has taken over the U.S. and placed mutants in concentration camps.\n* A female Master Mold appears in ''[[Wolverine and the X-Men (TV series)|Wolverine and the X-Men]]'', voiced by [[Gwendoline Yeo]]. This version was created by Bolivar Trask to serve as a processing terminal for his Sentinels. In a possible dystopian future, Master Mold and her Sentinels have taken over the world, captured mutants to upgrade themselves, and converted humans into cyborgs to serve as wardens in their detention facilities. In the hope of averting this future, Professor X tasks [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] with reforming the X-Men and destroying Master Mold in the present. While Wolverine destroys her present body and the X-Men eventually succeed in averting the Sentinel-controlled future, she secretly transfers her programming into a damaged Sentinel and escapes.\n\n===Video games===\n* Master Mold appears in ''[[Spider-Man and the X-Men in Arcade's Revenge]]'' as the final boss of [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]]'s stage.\n* Master Mold appears as a background character in ''[[X-Men: Children of the Atom (video game)|X-Men: Children of the Atom]]''.\n* Master Mold appears in ''[[X-Men 2: Clone Wars]]''.\n* Master Mold appears in ''[[X-Men Legends]]''.
