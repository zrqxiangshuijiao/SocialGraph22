Created by writer [[Zeb Wells]] and artist [[Skottie Young]], she debuted in ''New Warriors'' vol. 3 #4. Little is known about her at this time. She is a superhero who avoided being killed in the opening shots of Marvel's [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]] by not reuniting with the team after their [[reality show]] was cancelled the first time in ''New Warriors'' vol. 3 #6.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n\n===New Warriors===\nDebrii was introduced by the New Warriors' TV producer, Ashley, and so was the only member of [[Night Thrasher]]'s revised team to have not been hand-picked by him. The TV company's board of directors felt that there was no \"friction\" in the current team \u2014 they all liked each other too much \u2014 and that the show would get better ratings if an unknown quantity was added to the team. Debrii's abrasive, antagonistic personality was perfect in this regard; she did not get on well with any of the team members, frequently making snide comments about [[Microbe (comics)|Microbe]]'s relatively useless powers and constantly arguing with [[Namorita]].<ref>''New Warriors'' vol. 3 #4\u20136</ref>\n\n===Civil War===\nDebrii was one of the former Warriors who felt the sting of the growing anti-New-Warriors movement when her secret identity was \"outed\" online through a New Warriors [[hate site]], after which her car was overturned and set on fire.<ref>''[[She-Hulk]]'' vol. 2 #8 (2006)</ref>\n\nAfter the death of [[Bill Foster (comics)|Black Goliath]] at the hands of a cloned [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], Debrii was compelled to become involved and joined up with [[Captain America]]'s Secret Avengers.<ref>''Civil War'' #4</ref>\n\n===Initiative===\nDeborah has been identified as one of the 142 registered superheroes who are a part of the [[Avengers: The Initiative|Initiative program]].<ref>[[Avengers: The Initiative]] #1</ref><ref>[http://marvel.com/news/story/947/avengers_the_initiative_1_character_map Avengers: The Initiative #1 Character Map]</ref> She was one of the former Warriors that was accused of [[Gauntlet (comics)|Gauntlet]]'s beating. In truth it was her fellow recruit [[Slapstick (comics)|Slapstick]] who performed the crime, he was sick of Gauntlet insulting his dead friends.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #6 (2007)</ref>\n\nDebrii later quit the Initiative, along with [[Vance Astrovik|Justice]], [[Rage (comics)|Rage]], and Slapstick forming the a team called [[Counter Force (Marvel Comics)|Counter Force]].<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #12</ref> She later returned to Camp Hammond with the team, now calling themselves the New Warriors again,<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #21</ref> and battled [[Ragnarok (comics)|Ragnarok]], the clone of Thor.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #22</ref><ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=preview&id=2083 Preview: Avengers: The Initiative #22]</ref>\n\nDebrii eventually quits the team, and leaves the country to go into hiding with [[Heavy Hitters (comics)|Heavy Hitters]] members Nonstop and Telemetry.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #28</ref><ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=24211 Christos Gage's War \"Initiative\"]</ref> After the fall of Osborn, she is no longer a fugitive but remains in Paris, working as the snarky judge of a TV talent competition, \"Superpouvoir.\"<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #35</ref>\n\n===Fear Itself===\nDuring the ''[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]'' storyline, Debrii appears at a meeting held by [[Prodigy (Ritchie Gilmore)|Prodigy]] regarding magical hammers that have crashed into the Earth.<ref>''Fear Itself: Youth In Revolt'' #1</ref> Debrii and other heroes then battle [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]], who was transformed into Kuurth: Breaker of Stone, in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]].<ref>''Fear Itself: Youth In Revolt'' #3</ref> She and Rage then appear rescuing survivors and help the team in their battle against [[Thor Girl]], who had recovered her designate powers.<ref>''Fear Itself: Youth In Revolt'' #4, 6</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nDebrii is described as a \"low level telekinetic magnet\".<ref>''New Warriors'' vol. 3 #4, page 20</ref> She is able to move masses of huge objects in her immediate vicinity at will, and is capable of manipulating many such objects at one time. She can use any \"debris\" around her to defend herself from attacks, or to attack her enemies. During the New Warriors' battle with the [[Mad Thinker]]'s Intellectual Robots, she took control of a pile of scrap metal, crafting a shell in the form of a large monster around her body, and manipulating this creation as a weapon.\n\nIn the ''New Warriors'' series where they star on a reality television show Debrii is actually considered a low level electromagnetic telekinetic. Although she is able to move massive amounts of debris she cannot lift anything really heavy with her powers. She can also levitate herself a little (probably not faster as she can comfortably walk), but cannot really fly.<ref>''New Warriors'' vol. 3 #4 (April 2009), p. 20</ref>\n\n==Other versions==\n\n===Age of X===\nIn the ''[[Age of X]]'' reality, a memory experience by Tempo revealed that a woman resembling Debrii was captured by the Sapien League and paraded down the street as a dangerous mutant.<ref>[[Mike Carey (writer)|Mike Carey]] (w), Clay Mann (p), Jay Leisten (i), \"Age of X\" (Chapter 1), ''X-Men: Legacy'' #245 (April, 2011)</ref> However, since the anti-mutant forces of this reality also targeted the non-mutant Spider-Man as part of their anti-mutant purge,<ref>Age of X Universe #1</ref> this is not confirmation that Debrii is a mutant, even if the unnamed woman in Tempo's memories is Debrii.\n\n==In other media==\nDebrii was set to appear in the [[Marvel Television]] live-action ''[[New Warriors (TV pilot)|New Warriors]]'' TV series, portrayed by [[Kate Comer]] before it was cancelled.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/marvels-new-warriors-squirrel-girl-cast-milana-vayntrub-derek-theler-topline-freeform-comedy-1019588|title = Marvel's 'New Warriors' Sets its Cast \u2014 Including Squirrel Girl (Exclusive)| work= [[The Hollywood Reporter]]| first= Lesley | last= Goldberg| date= July 10, 2017 |publisher= | access-date= January 11, 2022}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url= https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/tv/2017/04/19/sneak-peek-squirrel-girl-leads-freeform-series-new-warriors/100581106/| title= Exclusive sneak peek: Squirrel Girl leads the team of Freeform's 'New Warriors' |last=Truitt |first= Brian| work=[[USA Today]]| date=April 19, 2017 |access-date= April 19, 2017| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170420052727/https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/tv/2017/04/19/sneak-peek-squirrel-girl-leads-freeform-series-new-warriors/100581106/| archive-date= April 20, 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://thegww.com/exclusive-marvels-new-warriors-is-dead-superhero-show-fails-to-find-a-new-home/ |title=Exclusive: Marvel's 'New Warriors' is Dead; Superhero Show Fails to Find a New Home |last= Polito |first=Thomas |website=The GWW| date=September 15, 2019|access-date= September 15, 2019| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20190916081056/https://thegww.com/exclusive-marvels-new-warriors-is-dead-superhero-show-fails-to-find-a-new-home/| archive-date=September 16, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Marvelwiki|Debrii|Debrii}}\n* {{comicbookdb|type=character|title=Debrii|id=1645}}\n* [http://worldofblackheroes.com/2011/08/03/debrii-deborah-fields/ Debrii] at World of Black Heroes\n\n{{Initiative}}\n\n[[Category:Fictional African-American people]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics female superheroes]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics superheroes]]"}]}}}}
