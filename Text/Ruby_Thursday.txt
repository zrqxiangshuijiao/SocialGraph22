She is usually depicted as a member of the [[Headmen]]. She is named for the [[Rolling Stones]] song, \"[[Ruby Tuesday (song)|Ruby Tuesday]]\".\n\n==Publication history==\nRuby Thursday first appeared in ''[[The Defenders (comic book)|The Defenders]]'' #32-33 (February\u2013March 1976), and was created by [[Steve Gerber]], [[Sal Buscema]] and [[Jim Mooney]].\n\nThe character subsequently appears in ''Defenders'' #35 (May 1976), ''Defenders'' Annual #1 (October 1976), ''[[Omega the Unknown]]'' #9-10 (July, September 1976), ''Defenders'' #76-77 (October\u2013November 1979), ''The Sensational She-Hulk'' vol. 2 #1-3 (May\u2013July 1989), ''Web of Spider-Man'' #73 (February 1991), ''Deathlok'' #2-5 (August\u2013November 1991), ''Marvel Comics Presents'' #97 (December 1992), ''The Defenders'' vol. 2 #5 (July 2001), 8-10 (October\u2013December 2001), ''[[I Heart Marvel|I \u2665 Marvel: Outlaw Love]]'' (April 2006), ''She-Hulk'' vol. 2 #10 (October 2006), and ''Heroes for Hire'' #6-8 (March\u2013May 2007).\n\nRuby Thursday appeared as part of the \"Headmen\" entry in the original ''[[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe]]'' #5, and in ''The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Update '89'' #3, and she received an entry in ''The All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z: Update'' #4 (2007).\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nThursday was a scientist who grafted an organic computer to her head composed of malleable plastic that can assume any form she wills it to. She was recruited by [[Gorilla-Man#Arthur Nagan|Arthur Nagan]] into the supervillain group known as the [[Headmen]].<ref>''The Defenders'' #32</ref> Her residence at the time was a mansion in [[Laurel Canyon, Los Angeles|Laurel Canyon]].<ref name=autogenerated1>''The Defenders'' Annual #1</ref> Her intentions at the time of joining the headmen were to replace the head of every human with a plastic head like hers.<ref>''The Defenders'' #33</ref>\n\nShe ran for [[President of the United States]] as the candidate of the \"Global Head\" political party under the slogan \"New heads for old\".<ref>''The Defenders'' #40</ref> She was forced to drop out after Jack Norriss (associated with the superhero team known as the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]]) tricked her into revealing her non-human self at a public campaign event.<ref name=autogenerated1/> Shortly after the end of her presidential campaign, she was defeated by the Hulk and captured along with the rest of the Headmen by the Defenders.<ref name=autogenerated1/>\n\nShe later partners with a large purple creature called Dibbuk (named after, but unrelated to a [[dybbuk]]) and bases herself in Las Vegas. She robs [[Omega the Unknown]] of $55,000 in casino winnings in a Las Vegas hotel room. Omega chases her on foot in Las Vegas. Police arriving on the scene see a superhuman man in costume (Omega) appearing to assault a normal woman (Ruby) in her car. Omega starts brawling with the police and they open fire killing him.<ref>''Omega the Unknown'' #10</ref>\n\nAfter the death of Omega, Ruby notices that his body is made up of advanced organic cybernetics. She steals his body from a Las Vegas morgue and attempts to dissect it intending to incorporate its technology into her head. Confronted by the Defenders, her plastic head is struck by the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]]'s bio-electric \"sting\". The head breaks open and Dibbuk teleports a seriously wounded Ruby away.<ref>''The Defenders'' #77</ref> When next seen, her plastic head appears much smaller.\n\nRuby later participates in the plan to gain her ally [[Chondu the Mystic]] a new body; specifically, the body of a clone of [[She-Hulk]]. The Headmen hire the Ringmaster and his Circus of Crime, then later [[Mysterio]] in order to test She-Hulk for compatibility. She is subdued and cloned, but escapes with the aid of Spider-Man.<ref>''The Sensational She-Hulk'' vol. 2 #1-3 (May\u2013July 1989)</ref> Ruby is arrested by the New York city police.\n\nRuby begins running weapons procurement scams against [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M]]. She partners with and becomes romantically involved with the [[Answer (comics)|Answer]]. After having stolen money from A.I.M. on five occasions, A.I.M. hires the assassin [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]] to kill Ruby. He uses her relationship with Answer to draw her out of hiding and throws the [[Rolling Stones]] album ''[[Flashpoint (album)|Flashpoint]]'' (which contains the song \"[[Ruby Tuesday (song)|Ruby Tuesday]]\") into her chest apparently killing the biological portion of her body. The [[Answer (comics)|Answer]] saves her head after Bullseye leaves in hopes of reviving her later.<ref>''[[I \u2665 Marvel|I \u2665 Marvel: Outlaw Love]]''</ref>\n\nDuring the ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'', Ruby later is involved in a high-speed 'chase' through the streets of Manhattan. The super-heroine [[Patsy Walker|Hellcat]] ends up clinging to her bumper. Ruby uses her malleable head to fire a gun at Hellcat during the pursuit. The fight is ended with the intervention of She-Hulk and her allies. She-Hulk does not actually go for Ruby, she takes down Hellcat first for being an unlicensed superhero. The results of Ruby's rampage are shown in the forms of cars being shot up, people traumatized by this, and a cab ending up through the front window of a bookstore. Ruby herself is subdued by the weaponry of [[Two-Gun Kid]], a licensed bounty hunter for the state of New York.<ref>''She-Hulk'' #10 (Oct. 2006)</ref>\n\nRuby and the Headmen then fought the [[Heroes for Hire]] while attempting to transplant Chondu's head onto [[Humbug (comics)|Humbug]]'s body.<ref>''Heroes for Hire'' vol. 2 #6-8</ref> At some point, she was imprisoned in The Raft, which Wolverine broke her out of in his plan against Romulus. Ruby was contacted by Romulus and her daughter's life was threatened, forcing her to give Romulus the information to Wolverine's plans. When confronted by Wolverine, Ruby attacked, defeating him by impaling him with the tentacles she had formed with her head. Soon, [[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Cloak]], [[Silver Samurai]], [[Skaar (character)|Skaar]], and [[Hulk|Bruce Banner]] appeared, all battling Ruby Thursday. She held her own, but was eventually caught by Skaar and teleported back to The Raft by Cloak. It was later discovered The Answer is the one who had planned her escape.<ref>''Wolverine Origins'' #7</ref>\n\nFollowing the ''[[Avengers vs. X-Men]]'' storyline, Ruby Thursday is among the villains that are imprisoned at an unnamed prison. She participated in a prison riot until she and the other villains were defeated by [[Mimic (comics)|Mimic]] and [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]].<ref>''X-Men: Legacy'' #275</ref>\n\nAs part of the \"[[All-New, All-Different Marvel]]\" branding, Ruby Thursday subsequently attacks a police station with [[Gibbon (comics)|Gibbon]], [[Griffin (Marvel Comics)|Griffin]], and [[Shriek (comics)|Shriek]]. The quartet is subdued by [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Spider-Woman]]'s apprentice, [[Porcupine (comics)#Roger Gocking|Porcupine]].<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Dennis Hopeless|penciller = Javier Rodriguez|inker = Alvaro Lopez|colorist = Javier Rodriguez|letterer = VC's Travis Lanham|editor = Devin Lewis|title = Spider-Woman|volume = 6|issue = #1|date = 18 November 2015|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nRuby Thursday's head has been replaced with a mass of \"organic circuitry\". The red spherical mass can alter its shape so she can form tentacles and fire projectiles and energy blasts. If the sphere is removed from the body, Ruby can still control her body.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://marvel.com/universe/Ruby_Thursday Ruby Thursday] at Marvel.com\n* [http://marvel.wikia.com/wiki/Thursday_Rubinstein_(Earth-616) Ruby Thursday] at Marvel Wiki\n* [https://comicvine.gamespot.com/ruby-thursday/4005-11933/ Ruby Thursday] at Comic Vine\n* {{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix4/rubythursdayhm.htm|Ruby Thursday}}\n\n{{Defenders}}\n{{She-Hulk}}\n{{Steve Gerber}}\n\n[[Category:Characters created by Jim Mooney]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Sal Buscema]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Steve Gerber]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1976]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics female supervillains]]"}]}}}}
