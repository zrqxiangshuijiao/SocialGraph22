Upon choosing either Gamora or Drax the Destroyer to accompany him, Star-Lord arrives on the Kree ship to confront Hala the Accuser who plans to use the Eternity Forge to resurrect her son Bal-Dinn and the entire Kree race as the Kree and their entire planet were destroyed by [[Thanos]]. This apparently will require numerous sacrifices in the process. She critically wounds Peter with her [[lance]]. Rocket Raccoon manages to get the ship running to allow the two to escape from Hala the Accuser and Star-Lord manages to obtain the Eternity Forge back in the process which eventually heals him. In episode 2, Hala the Accuser pursues the Guardians of the Galaxy in order to obtain the Eternity Forge. After the Guardians of the Galaxy fight off a Kree ambush on the Milano, Hala the Accuser contacts Star-Lord telling him that he can't run forever and that the Eternity Forge will be hers.

The choices Star-Lord makes will either have Hala the Accuser burned but empowered by its destruction or successfully reviving Bal-Dinn with plans to revive the dead Kree that are with her. In episode 4, the episode returned with either Hala burned and empowered, or managed to get the Eternity Forge, successfully reviving her son and the dead Kree. Then the shrine begins to collapse, while the Guardians fight off Hala and the Kree, the Guardians fall off the shrine, and Hala watch them fall. Later on after the Guardians escape the Shrine, Hala and the Kree started a violent attack on D\u2019Bari V, killing millions to proceed to revive the rest of the dead Kree. In episode 5, the Guardians of the Galaxy and Mantis unite to fight Hala where Hala's outcome varies upon her defeat. One outcome will have her either be handed over to Bal-Dinn to face Kree justice or the Nova Corps. Another outcome will have Hala either killed by Bal-Dinn or dying when the remnants of the Eternity Forge leaving her body.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Hala_(Earth-616) Hala the Accuser] at Marvel Wiki\n* [https://comicvine.gamespot.com/hala/4005-124890/ Hala the Accuser] at Comic Vine\n* [https://comicbookrealm.com/report/character/26354/hala-the-accuser-hala Hala the Accuser] at Comic Book Realm\n\n{{Guardians of the Galaxy}}\n{{Brian Michael Bendis}}\n\n[[Category:Characters created by Brian Michael Bendis]]\n[[Category:Kree]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters who can move at superhuman speeds]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters with superhuman strength]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics extraterrestrial supervillains]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics female supervillains]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]"}]}}}}
