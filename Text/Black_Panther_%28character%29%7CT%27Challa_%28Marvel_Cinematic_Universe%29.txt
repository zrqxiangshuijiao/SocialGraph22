The character was created by writer-editor [[Stan Lee]] and artist-coplotter [[Jack Kirby]]. The character first appeared in ''[[Fantastic Four (comic book)|Fantastic Four]]'' #52 ([[cover-date]]d July 1966) in the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]]. Black Panther's real name is '''T'Challa''', and he is depicted as the king and protector of the fictional African nation of [[Wakanda]]. Along with possessing enhanced abilities achieved through ancient Wakandan rituals of drinking the essence of the heart-shaped herb, T'Challa also relies on his proficiency in science, rigorous physical training, hand-to-hand combat skills, and access to wealth and advanced Wakandan technology to combat his enemies.\n\nBlack Panther is the first superhero of [[Indigenous peoples of Africa|African descent]]<!--People of African descent include Africans. This is a stronger statement than simply saying \"first African superhero\".--> in mainstream American comics, having debuted years before early [[Black people|black]] superheroes such as Marvel Comics' the [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]] (1969), [[Luke Cage]] (1972), and [[Blade (comics)|Blade]] (1973) or [[DC Comics]]' [[John Stewart (comics)|John Stewart]] in the role of [[Green Lantern]] (1971). In one comic book storyline, the Black Panther mantle is handled by [[White Tiger (Kasper Cole)|Kasper Cole]], a multiracial [[New York City]] [[New York City Police Department|police officer]]. Beginning as an impersonator, Cole would later take on the moniker of [[White Tiger (comics)|White Tiger]] and become an ally to T'Challa. The role of Black Panther and leadership of Wakanda was also given to T'Challa's sister [[Shuri (comics)|Shuri]] while he was in a coma for a short time.\n\nBlack Panther has made numerous appearances in various television shows, animated films and video games. [[Chadwick Boseman]] portrayed the [[T'Challa (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|character]] in [[Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase Three|Phase Three]] of the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]]'s films: ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'' (2016), ''[[Black Panther (film)|Black Panther]]'' (2018), ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'' (2018), and ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'' (2019), and voiced alternate versions of the character in the first season of the [[animated series]] ''[[What If...?

In addition to ruling the country, he is also [[paramount chief]] of its various tribes (collectively referred to as the Wakandas). The Panther habit is a symbol of office (head of state) and is used even during diplomatic missions. The Panther is a hereditary title, but one must still earn it.\n\nIn the distant past, a [[meteorite]] made of the (fictional) vibration-absorbing mineral [[vibranium]] crashed in Wakanda, and was unearthed. Reasoning that outsiders would exploit Wakanda for this valuable resource, the ruler, King [[T'Chaka]], like his father and other Panthers before him, concealed his country from the outside world. T'Chaka's first wife N'Yami died while in labor with '''T'Challa''', and his second wife [[Ramonda (comics)|Ramonda]] was taken prisoner by Anton Pretorius during a visit to her homeland of [[South Africa]], so for most of his childhood T'Challa was raised by his father alone.<ref name=\"MCP13-37\">''Marvel Comics Presents'' #13\u201337 (February \u2013 December 1989)</ref> T'Chaka was murdered by the adventurer [[Klaw (Marvel Comics)|Ulysses Klaw]] in an attempt to seize the vibranium mound.

While on his Wakandan [[walkabout]] [[rite of passage]], T'Challa met and fell in love with apparent orphaned teen [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Ororo Munroe]], who would grow up to become the X-Men member Storm.<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #100 (December 1980), revised in ''Storm'' vol. 2 #1\u20136 (2006)</ref> The two broke off their relationship due to his desire to avenge his father's death and to become the type of man who could suitably lead Wakanda, but they would see each other over the years when they could.\n\nT'Challa earned the title and attributes of the Black Panther by defeating the various champions of the Wakandan tribes.

(TV series)|What If...?]]'' centered on the [[#Star-Lord|Star-Lord T'Challa variant]] introduced in the series was revealed to be have been in early development prior to Boseman's death, which placed the project in [[Development hell|\"limbo\"]]; series director [[Bryan Andrews (filmmaker)|Bryan Andrews]] nonetheless expressed interest in the spin-off being produced \"one day\" in Boseman's honor, with a different voice actor voicing the character.<ref name=\"VarietyOct2021\" />\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n===Pursuit of Bucky Barnes===\n{{further|Captain America: Civil War}}\nAt a conference in [[Vienna]] where the [[Sokovia Accords]] governing superhero activity are to be ratified, a bomb kills T'Challa's father, King [[T'Chaka (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|T'Chaka]] of Wakanda. Security footage indicates the bomber is [[Bucky Barnes (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Bucky Barnes]], whom T'Challa vows to kill. [[Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Steve Rogers]] and [[Sam Wilson (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Sam Wilson]] track Barnes to [[Bucharest]] and attempt to protect him from T'Challa and the authorities, but all four, including T'Challa, are apprehended by the Bucharest police and [[James Rhodes (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|James Rhodes]]. Impersonating a psychiatrist sent to interview Barnes, [[Helmut Zemo (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Helmut Zemo]] recites the trigger words to activate Barnes' brainwashing, and sends Barnes on a rampage to cover his own escape. Barnes briefly fights T'Challa while fleeing the building, where Rogers stops Barnes and sneaks him away, recruiting several other Avengers to help him go after Zemo. [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark]] assembles his own team composed of T'Challa, [[Natasha Romanoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Natasha Romanoff]], Rhodes, [[Vision (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Vision]], and [[Peter Parker (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Peter Parker]] to capture the renegades. Stark's team intercepts Rogers' group at [[Leipzig/Halle Airport]], where they fight (including personal confrontations against Barnes, [[Scott Lang (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Scott Lang as Giant-Man]], and [[Clint Barton (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Clint Barton]]), until Romanoff shocks T'Challa to allow Rogers and Barnes to escape. T'Challa tracks Rogers and Barnes to a Siberian Hydra facility, discovering that Zemo is the true perpetrator. While Rogers and Barnes are fighting Stark, T'Challa stops Zemo from committing suicide and takes him to the authorities. T'Challa grants Barnes asylum in Wakanda, where Barnes chooses to return to cryogenic sleep until a cure for his brainwashing is found.\n\n===King of Wakanda===\n{{further|Black Panther (film)}}\nWith T'Chaka having died, T'Challa assumes the throne. He and [[Okoye (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Okoye]], the leader of the [[Dora Milaje (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Dora Milaje]] regiment, extract T'Challa's ex-lover [[Nakia (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Nakia]] from an undercover assignment so she can attend his coronation ceremony with his mother [[Ramonda (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Ramonda]] and younger sister [[Shuri (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Shuri]]. At the ceremony, the Jabari Tribe's leader [[M'Baku (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|M'Baku]] challenges T'Challa for the crown in ritual combat. Although M'Baku initially has the upper hand, T'Challa defeats M'Baku and persuades him to yield rather than die.\n\nWhen [[Ulysses Klaue (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Ulysses Klaue]] and his accomplice [[Killmonger (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Erik Stevens]] steal a Wakandan artifact from a London museum, T'Challa's friend and Okoye's lover [[W'Kabi (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|W'Kabi]] urges him to bring Klaue back alive. T'Challa, Okoye, and Nakia travel to [[Busan]], [[South Korea]], where Klaue plans to sell the artifact to [[CIA]] agent [[Everett K. Ross (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Everett K. Ross]]. A firefight erupts and Klaue attempts to flee but is caught by T'Challa, who reluctantly releases him to Ross' custody. Erik attacks and extracts Klaue; Ross is gravely injured protecting Nakia. Rather than pursue Klaue, T'Challa takes Ross to Wakanda, where their technology can save him. As Shuri heals Ross, T'Challa confronts [[Zuri (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Zuri]] about [[N'Jobu]]. Zuri explains that N'Jobu planned to share Wakanda's technology with people of African descent around the world to help them conquer their oppressors. As T'Chaka arrested N'Jobu, the latter attacked Zuri and forced T'Chaka to kill him. T'Chaka ordered Zuri to lie that N'Jobu had disappeared and left behind N'Jobu's American son in order to maintain the lie. This boy grew up to be Stevens, a U.S. [[black ops]] soldier who adopted the name \"Killmonger\". Meanwhile, Killmonger kills Klaue and takes his body to Wakanda. He is brought before the tribal elders, revealing his identity to be N'Jadaka and claim to the throne. Killmonger challenges T'Challa to ritual combat, where he kills Zuri, defeats T'Challa, and hurls him over a waterfall to his presumed death. Killmonger ingests the heart-shaped herb and orders the rest incinerated, but Nakia extracts one first.\n\nNakia, Shuri, Ramonda, and Ross flee to the Jabari Tribe for aid. They find a comatose T'Challa, rescued by the Jabari in repayment for sparing M'Baku's life. Healed by Nakia's herb, T'Challa returns to fight Killmonger, who dons his own Black Panther suit. Fighting in Wakanda's vibranium mine, T'Challa disrupts Killmonger's suit and stabs him. Killmonger refuses to be healed, choosing to die a free man rather than be incarcerated. T'Challa establishes an outreach center at the building where N'Jobu died, to be run by Nakia and Shuri. In a mid-credits scene, T'Challa appears before the [[United Nations]] to reveal Wakanda's true nature to the world.\n\n===Conflict against Thanos===\n{{further|Avengers: Infinity War|Avengers: Endgame}}\nIn 2018, T'Challa brings a new robotic arm to Barnes. He then welcomes Rogers, Romanoff, Wilson, Rhodes, [[Bruce Banner (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Bruce Banner]], Maximoff, and Vision when they arrive in Wakanda, so Shuri can work on Vision. He along with the Wakandan army, Barnes, Rogers, Romanoff, Wilson, Rhodes, and Banner fight off the oncoming onslaught of [[Species of the Marvel Cinematic Universe#Outriders|Outriders]] and witnesses the arrival of [[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thor]], [[Rocket (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Rocket]], and [[Groot (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Groot]]. However, [[Thanos (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thanos]] arrives in Wakanda and completes and activates the Infinity Gauntlet, killing half of all life in the universe. As a result, T\u2019Challa disintegrates along with Barnes, Wilson, Maximoff, and Groot.\n\nIn 2023, T'Challa is restored to life when the surviving Avengers recreate the [[Infinity Gauntlet (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Infinity Gauntlet]]. He and the Wakandan army are brought by [[Stephen Strange (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Stephen Strange]] to the destroyed [[Avengers Compound (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Avengers Compound]] to join in the final battle against an alternate 2014 version of Thanos. T'Challa later attends Tony Stark's funeral, after he sacrifices his life to defeat Thanos and his army.\n\n==Alternate versions==\n{{Infobox character\n| color = #AF181F\n| name = Star-Lord T'Challa\n| franchise = [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]]\n| image = \n| image_upright = \n| caption = Star-Lord (T'Challa) voiced by [[Chadwick Boseman]] in \"[[What If...?]]\" (2021)\n| based_on = {{Plainlist|\n* {{Based on|[[Black Panther (character)|Black Panther]]|[[Stan Lee]]|{{quad}}[[Jack Kirby]]}}\n* {{Based on|[[Star-Lord]]|[[Steve Englehart]]|{{quad}}[[Steve Gan]]}}\n}}\n| adapted_by = Matthew Chauncey\n| voice = {{Plainlist|\n* Chadwick Boseman \n* Maddix Robinson (young)<ref name=\"Robinson\">{{Cite web |last=Gallagher |first=Simon |date=August 18, 2021 |title=What If\u2026?

However, [[Yondu Udonta (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Yondu Udonta's]] minions [[Kraglin (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Kraglin]] and [[Taserface (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Taserface]] mistakenly abduct a young T'Challa who agrees to join them in exploring the galaxy.\n\n20 years later, T'Challa becomes a famous galactic outlaw mercenary known as \"[[Star-Lord]]\". He restructured the Ravagers to be like the [[Merry Men]], stopped the robbery of the bank on Tarnax IV with some [[Skrulls (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Skrulls]] getting injured, provided weaponry to the Ankaran Resistance, saved the Kylosians from the Kree, and persuaded Thanos not to decimate half the universe with Thanos joining the Ravagers.\n\nAfter acquiring the Orb containing the [[Power Stone (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Power Stone]] on Morag while gaining [[Korath the Pursuer (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Korath the Pursuer]] as a new recruit, T'Challa and the Ravagers head to a bar on Contraxia. T'Challa then meets the bartender [[Drax (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Drax]] who thanked him for saving his family. The Ravagers are then approached by [[Nebula (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Nebula]], who proposes a heist to steal the Embers of Genesis, a cosmic dust form capable of terraforming ecosystems. Nebula and Yondu meet with [[Taneleer Tivan (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Taneleer Tivan]] on [[Knowhere (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Knowhere]], while T'Challa infiltrates his collection to find the Embers.\n\nHe discovers a Wakandan spacecraft containing a message from his father, T'Chaka. Nebula seemingly betrays the Ravagers, leading to T'Challa being captured and put on display for Tivan's assessment. She later rescues the Ravagers, revealing that she and T'Challa planned a ruse so she could acquire the Embers. T'Challa manages to escape his confinement and battles Tivan with Udonta's help. The two trap Tivan in his own display before handing over control to his assistant Carina. Afterwards, the Ravagers head to Earth where T'Challa reunites with his parents and younger sister in Wakanda.\n\nT'Challa leads the Ravagers to battle [[Ego (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Ego]] on Earth and save Peter Quill before the [[Watcher (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Watcher]] emerges and recruits him to join the [[Guardians of the Multiverse]] with the mission to defeat a variant of [[Ultron (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Ultron]] who is attempting to destroy reality. T'Challa joins [[Doctor Strange Supreme]], [[Captain Carter]], [[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thor]], [[Gamora (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Gamora]], and [[Killmonger (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Killmonger]] in a battle against Ultron. During the fight, T'Challa steals the [[Soul Stone]] in order to reduce Ultron's powers, but the Guardians are still overwhelmed. They eventually succeed after Natasha Romanoff injects [[Arnim Zola (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Arnim Zola]]'s analog consciousness into Ultron's A.I., shutting him down. T'Challa returns to his universe and teaches Quill how to shoot a blaster.\n\n===Zombie outbreak===\n{{Main|What If...

As the Avengers are attacked and turned into [[zombies]], T'Challa is rescued by Vision, but he soon learns that Vision only saved him so he could harvest T'Challa's body for the infected [[Wanda Maximoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Wanda Maximoff]]. When the remaining survivors arrive at Vision's base, [[Bucky Barnes (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Bucky Barnes]] finds T'Challa missing his right leg. As most of the heroes sacrifice themselves to fend off Maximoff and the rest of the zombies, T'Challa, along with [[Peter Parker (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Peter Parker]] and [[Scott Lang (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Scott Lang]], take the Quadjet to Wakanda, hoping to use Vision's Mind Stone to find a way to cure the population. Unbeknownst to them, Wakanda has been infected and taken over by a zombified Thanos.\n\n===American\u2013Wakandan War===\n{{Further|What If...

However, he is lured into a trap by Killmonger, who proceeds to kill both T'Challa and Rhodes, sparking a conflict between the United States and Wakanda. As a funeral for T'Challa is held in Wakanda, Killmonger convinces the Wakandans that T'Challa was killed by Rhodes and earns their trust. After ingesting the Heart-Shaped Herb, Killmonger meets T'Challa's spirit in the Ancestral Realm, where he warns Killmonger that his thirst for power would eventually consume him.\n\n==Reception==\n[[File:FanimeCon 2018 347 (40640219200).jpg|thumb|A [[cosplay]] of the Black Panther at [[FanimeCon]] 2018]]\nBoseman's performance as T'Challa / Black Panther has not only received critical acclaim from critics and audiences, but has become significant as one of the first superheroes of African descent to gain a leading role in a big-budget film.<ref>{{Cite web |author=Reuters Staff |date=2018-02-08 |title='Black Panther' gets superhero reception from critics |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-film-blackpanther-idUSKBN1FR01D |access-date=2020-10-16 |website=Reuters |language=en |archive-date=December 12, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201212043021/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-film-blackpanther-idUSKBN1FR01D |url-status=live }}</ref> With T'Challa's MCU debut in ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'', Eliana Dockterman, writing for ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', described the character's significance and wrote that he intrigued audiences in a supporting role.<ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Dockterman |first=Eliana |date=2016-05-05 |title=Why Black Panther's Debut in Captain America: Civil War Is So Important |url=https://time.com/4314966/black-panther-marvel-captain-america/ |access-date=2020-10-16 |magazine=Time |archive-date=October 1, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201001163847/https://time.com/4314966/black-panther-marvel-captain-america/ |url-status=live }}</ref> Two years later, Jamil Smith, also of ''Time'', wrote that T'Challa's character and the ''[[Black Panther (film)|Black Panther]]'' film in general were significant as they showed \"what it means to be black in both America and Africa\u2014and, more broadly, in the world.\" He describes T'Challa as a \"fictional African King with the technological war power to destroy you\u2014or, worse, the wealth to buy your land\" and argued that the film embodied \"the most productive responses to bigotry\" by showing the potential of minorities, especially those of black descent.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Smith |first=Jamil |date=2018-02-19 |title=Behind the Revolutionary Power of Black Panther |url=https://time.com/black-panther/ |access-date=2020-10-16 |website=TIME.com |archive-date=October 16, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201016021338/https://time.com/black-panther/ |url-status=live }}</ref> Likewise, [[Todd McCarthy]] of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' praised Boseman's performance, stating that he \"certainly holds his own\" among strong performances from other actors in the film.<ref name=\"THR_Review\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/black-panther-review-1080811|title='Black Panther': Film Review|last=McCarthy|first=Todd|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=February 6, 2018|access-date=February 6, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180206214759/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/black-panther-review-1080811|archive-date=February 6, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Awards and nominations===\nAwards and nominations received by Boseman for his performance as T'Challa include:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n!scope=\"col\"|Year\n!scope=\"col\"|Award\n!scope=\"col\"|Category\n!scope=\"col\"|Nominated work\n!scope=\"col\"|Result\n!scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"|Ref.\n|-\n! scope=row rowspan=\"2\"| [[2016 Teen Choice Awards|2016]]\n| rowspan=\"2\"|[[Teen Choice Awards]]\n| Choice Movie: Chemistry\n| rowspan=\"5\"|''[[Captain America: Civil War]]''\n| {{nom}}\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eonline.com/news/771305/teen-choice-awards-2016-captain-america-civil-war-leads-second-wave-of-nominations|title=Teen Choice Awards 2016\u2014Captain America: Civil War Leads Second Wave of Nominations|website=E!
