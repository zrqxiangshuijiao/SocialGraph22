When her world's government called for volunteers to become [[Spaceknights]] to battle the alien [[Dire Wraiths]], Landra was one of those who accepted the call.

She had a romantic relationship with a local young man, Steve Jackson. Brandy was the first person to meet the Spaceknight [[Rom (comics)|Rom]] when he landed on Earth, and helped him as he tracked down and banished the [[Dire Wraiths]] that had infiltrated the town.<ref>''Rom'' #1</ref> Brandy came to fall in love with Rom because of his nobility,{{issue|date=April 2019}} which caused friction between them and Steve.{{issue|date=April 2019}}\n\nNot long after the death of Landra (the original Starshine), Rom left Clairton to continue seeking out Wraiths elsewhere.<ref>''Rom'' #33</ref> Brandy felt strangely compelled to dig up Starshine's body. A Wraith [[Magician (fantasy)|sorcerer]] called Doctor Dredd then magically transplanted Brandy's body into the Starshine armor as part of an evil plan.<ref>''Rom'' #40</ref> This was something she had secretly yearned for; and afterwards, she left Clairton and accompanied Rom as he traveled the Earth.<ref>''Rom'' #44</ref>\n\nDuring their absence, all of Clairton's citizens were killed by female Dire Wraiths when they decided to take over from their males. Steve and Brandy's family were among the dead, which made her bitter and vengeful, even causing the Starshine armor she wore to morph into a more fierce-looking one.<ref>''Rom'' #49</ref> She continued to help Rom battle the Wraiths, until she was magically changed back into her human form by [[Hybrid (Jimmy Marks)|Hybrid]].<ref>''Rom Annual'' #3</ref>\n\nWhen all the Wraiths were finally defeated, Rom left for [[Galador (comics)|Galador]], leaving Brandy on Earth.<ref>''Rom'' #66</ref> Her desire to be with him was noticed by the cosmic entity the [[Beyonder]], who was active on Earth at the time. He granted her wish to be sent to Galador, where she hoped to be reunited with Rom.{{Issue|date= June 2009}} However, she arrived before he did, and it turned out that a second generation of Spaceknights had turned against the human Galadorians and killed most of them off.<ref name= Rom74>''Rom'' #74, January 1986</ref> Brandy joined the [[Resistance movement|underground resistance]], but ultimately all human Galadorians were killed, and Brandy herself was only saved by the timely arrival of Rom.<ref name= Rom74 /> With help from the original Spaceknights, Rom defeats the evil ones. He reclaims his \"humanity\" (human body parts) which he had until then thought lost.  Rom stays on Galador with Brandy while the other Spaceknights (who had lost their human bodies permanently) watch over them from space.<ref>''Rom'' #75</ref>\n\nBrandy was seen again at [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]]' wedding along with the now-human Rom; she appeared to be pregnant.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #418</ref>\n\nBrandy had two sons with Rom, both of whom became Spaceknights as well.<ref>''Spaceknights'' #1</ref>\n\nWhen the Builders come to Galador, Starshine helps defend the world along with [[Terminator (Marvel Comics)|Terminator]], Ikon, Firefall, and Pulsar.<ref>''Infinity'' #1</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nBoth Starshines derived their powers from their [[bionic]] Spaceknight armor. In addition to giving them superhuman strength and the ability to fly in space across interstellar distances, the armor could channel the extra-dimensional energy known as the Living Light from its eyes, which they could use to reveal the true form of a disguised Dire Wraith, or as destructive energy beams.\n\nAfter being separated from the Starshine armor, Brandy continued to display certain abilities. A \"ghost\" of Starshine saved Rom from Wraith darkness, and several times the outlines of her armor appeared around her, usually in times of stress. It was noted that when this occurred, she seemed stronger than human, although the plot point was eventually dropped.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Rom the Space Knight}}\n{{Marvel Cosmic}}\n\n[[Category:Fictional characters from West Virginia]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics aliens]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics female superheroes]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics superheroes]]\n[[Category:Rom the Space Knight]]"}]}}}}
