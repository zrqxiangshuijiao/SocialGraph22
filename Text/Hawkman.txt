Created by writer [[Gardner Fox]] and artist [[Dennis Neville]], the original Hawkman first appeared in ''[[Flash Comics]]'' #1, published by [[All-American Publications]] in 1940.\n\nSeveral incarnations of Hawkman have appeared in DC Comics, all of them characterized by the use of archaic weaponry and by large, artificial wings, attached to a harness made from the special Nth metal that allows flight. Most incarnations of Hawkman work closely with a partner/romantic interest named [[Hawkgirl]] or [[Hawkwoman]].\n\nHawkman is most often depicted as human archaeologist [[Hawkman (Carter Hall)|Carter Hall]]\u2014the modern-day reincarnation of an ancient Egyptian prince named Khufu\u2014or as [[Thanagarian]] police officer [[Hawkman (Katar Hol)|Katar Hol]] from the planet Thanagar. The character is generally regarded as having one of the most confusing backstories of any in DC Comics, due to a series of reinventions over the years following DC's 1985 series ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]''. Some writers have attempted to integrate Carter Hall and Katar Hol into one story by linking the Thanagarian aliens to the Egyptian curse that causes Hawkman to [[reincarnation|reincarnate]] periodically throughout human history, or by using Carter Hall as Katar Hol's alias, or otherwise depicting the merger of Carter and Katar into one being.\n\nThe character has been adapted into other media numerous times, with significant appearances in the animated ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' cartoon, which featured Hawkgirl as a main character, as well as several [[DC Universe Original Animated Movies]].\n\nIn live action, the character first appeared onscreen in the two-part 1979 TV special ''[[Legends of the Superheroes]]'' by Bill Nuckols appearing alongside Adam West and Burt Ward as allies Batman and Robin. Hawkman was later portrayed by [[Michael Shanks]] in ''[[Smallville]]'' and by [[Falk Hentschel]] in [[The CW]]'s [[Arrowverse]] family of shows, with both versions favoring the ancient Egyptian version of the character. Hawkman made his cinematic debut and portrayed by [[Aldis Hodge]] in 2022's ''[[Black Adam (film)|Black Adam]]'' set in the [[DC Extended Universe]].\n\n==Publication history==\nHawkman first appeared in ''[[Flash Comics]]'' #1 (1940), and was a featured character in that title throughout the 1940s. This Hawkman was [[Hawkman (Carter Hall)|Carter Hall]], a [[reincarnation]] of the [[ancient Egypt]]ian prince Khufu. Hall discovered that the mysterious \"ninth metal\" (later changed simply to \"Nth metal\") could negate the effects of [[gravity]] and allow him to fly. He donned a costume with large wings to allow him to control his flight and became the crimefighter, Hawkman. He also had a companion hawk named Big Red that assisted him in fighting crime. An [[archaeology|archaeologist]] by profession, Hall used ancient weapons from the [[museum]] that he curated.\n\n[[File:Flash Comics 71.JPG|thumb|left|180px|The Golden Age Hawkman, from ''Flash Comics'' # 71 (May 1946). Art by [[Joe Kubert]]]]\nHawkman was a charter member of the [[Justice Society of America]], beginning with ''[[All Star Comics]]'' #3 (Winter 1940). In issue #8 he became the JSA's chairman, a position he held until the end of the JSA's run in ''All Star Comics'' in 1951. He was the only member of the JSA to appear in every adventure during the [[Golden Age of Comic Books]]. He romanced his reincarnated bride, Shiera Saunders, who became the crimefighter [[Hawkgirl]]. His first three adventures were drawn by creator [[Dennis Neville]] (who modeled Hawkman's costume on the hawkmen characters in the [[Flash Gordon]] comic strip by [[Alex Raymond]]), then by [[Sheldon Moldoff]], and later by [[Joe Kubert]], who slightly redesigned his mask in ''Flash Comics'' # 85 (Jul 1947) and then, one year later, replaced the winged-hawk-like mask with a much simpler yellow cowl in ''Flash Comics'' #98 (Aug 1948).\n\nAlong with most other superheroes, Hawkman's Golden Age adventures came to an end when the industry turned away from the genre in the early 1950s. His last appearance was in ''All Star Comics'' #57 (1951).\n\nLater in the decade, DC Comics, under editor [[Julius Schwartz]], decided to revive a number of heroes in new incarnations, but retaining the same names and powers. Following the success of the [[Flash (DC Comics character)|Flash]] and [[Green Lantern]], Hawkman was revived in ''[[The Brave and the Bold]]'' # 34 (Feb\u2013Mar 1961), this time as an [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] [[police officer]] from the planet Thanagar, though his powers were largely the same. Created by [[Gardner Fox]] and [[Joe Kubert]], this Hawkman named [[Hawkman (Katar Hol)|Katar Hol]] came to Earth with his wife Shayera in pursuit of a criminal, and decided to remain on Earth to study earth police methods as well as fight crime. They adopted the names Carter and Shiera Hall and became curators of a museum in Midway City.\n\nThis Hawkman became a member of the [[Justice League]] of America in issue #31, where he often verbally sparred with the iconoclastic [[Liberalism|liberal]] hero [[Green Arrow]]. In the 1960s, it was revealed that the original Hawkman lived on the [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|parallel world]] of [[Earth-Two]], and that Katar Hol lived on [[Earth-One]]. The JLA and JSA had an annual meeting throughout the 1960s and 1970s during which the two heroes often met.\n\n[[File:Hawkman v1 3.jpg|thumb|left|180px|The Silver Age Hawkman and Hawkgirl, from ''Hawkman'' #3 (August\u2013September 1964). Art by [[Murphy Anderson]]]]\nThe [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]] Hawkman had his own series for a few years in the '60s, but with declining sales it ended at issue #27 and was then merged with that of the [[Atom (Ray Palmer)|Atom]]. ''Atom and Hawkman'' lasted only another year or so before cancellation.\n\nIn the late 1970s in ''[[Showcase (comics)|Showcase]]'' and ''[[World's Finest Comics]]'', Thanagar went to war with the planet [[Rann (fictional planet)|Rann]], the adopted home of [[Adam Strange]]. This led to Hawkman and Hawkwoman severing ties with their homeworld, and later fighting ''The Shadow War of Hawkman'' (written by [[Tony Isabella]]) as the [[Thanagarian]]s tried secretly to conquer the Earth.\n\nThe landmark 1985 series ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' resulted in a massive revision of much of DC continuity and led to many characters being substantially rewritten. Hawkman was to suffer some of the greatest confusion as successive writers sought to explain his various appearances. In the revised timeline there was a single Earth which had witnessed the JSA in the 1940s and the JLA decades later. Successive revisions sought to establish exactly who had been Hawkman and Hawkwoman at different stages. For the first few years the pre-Crisis incarnations were still used, during which time they were prominent across the DC Universe and joined the latest incarnation of the Justice League.\n\nDC decided to [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]] Hawkman, in a limited series (which later led to an ongoing series) titled ''[[Hawkworld]]'' originally by [[Timothy Truman|Tim Truman]], and later [[John Ostrander]]. In this series, Thanagar was a stratified society which conquered other worlds to enrich itself. Katar Hol was the son of a prominent official who rebelled against the status quo. He and his partner Shayera were sent to Earth and remained there for some years until Hol was apparently killed.\n\nThis created several continuity errors. Because the new Katar Hol had only just arrived on Earth, someone else had to have been Hawkman previously. In an attempt to resolve the problem it was established through [[retcon]]s that the Golden Age Hawkman and Hawkgirl had continued to operate sporadically after their supposed retirement in 1951 through the 1990s, and that Nth metal originally came from Thanagar. The Halls, and not the Hols, joined the original incarnation of the JLA. Another Hawkman\u2014Fel Andar, a Thanagarian agent\u2014had been the one who joined the Justice League during the 1980s, pretending to be a hero but secretly spying on the League for his Thanagarian masters.\n\nThe ''[[Zero Hour: Crisis in Time!|Zero Hour]]'' miniseries muddied the waters further by merging the different Hawkmen into a \"Hawkgod\", who was the focus character in the third volume of the monthly ''Hawkman'' series. This version of Hawkman also had a small role in the alternate-future series ''[[Kingdom Come (comics)|Kingdom Come]]''. After the end of this series, Hawkman's [[continuity (fiction)|continuity]] was considered by DC to be too complicated,{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} and he was absent from comics for several years.\n\nIn the late 1990s, the ''JSA'' series untangled Hawkman's continuity, establishing him as Carter Hall, a man who\u2014along with Shiera\u2014had been reincarnated dozens of times since his life in ancient Egypt, and whose powers were derived from Thanagarian Nth metal, which had been retroactively renamed from \"ninth metal\". The Katar Hol of the ''Hawkworld'' series had also come to Earth during the 1990s, as previously established. The 1980s Hawkman Fel Andar returned to Thanagar. The Hawkgod was later revealed to be an avatar of the Hawk aspect of the Red (from which [[Animal Man]] receives his powers) and only believed that he was Hawkman.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}\n\nDuring the ''[[Identity Crisis (DC Comics)|Identity Crisis]]'' miniseries, it was established that Hawkman (Carter Hall) had encouraged the [[mindwipe]] of [[Doctor Light (Arthur Light)|Doctor Light]] and had actually been the one to initially suggest the idea. His role in the mindwipe was the basis for his enmity with [[Green Arrow]], who felt that interfering with an individual's right to self-determination was beyond the moral right of any organization or government.\n\nSubsequently, Hawkman was reincarnated and given a new series in 2002 entitled ''Hawkman'' vol. 4, written initially by [[James Dale Robinson|James Robinson]] and [[Geoff Johns]], with art by [[Rags Morales]]. [[Justin Gray]] and [[Jimmy Palmiotti]] took over writing duties during the third year of the series. In 2006, the series was retitled ''Hawkgirl'' with issue #50 and given a new creative team of [[Walt Simonson]] and [[Howard Chaykin]]. This series was cancelled with issue #66 in July 2007.\n\nHawkman was a major character in the ''[[Rann\u2013Thanagar War]]'' miniseries, which stemmed from events in ''[[Countdown (comics)|Countdown to Infinite Crisis]]''. During this time his continuity was further changed (see Carter Hall section below).\n\nThe character then received a new series spinning out of ''[[Dark Nights: Metal]]'', helmed by [[Robert Venditti]] and [[Bryan Hitch]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Adams |first1=Tim |title=DC's Hawkman Takes Flight in New Series From Venditti & Hitch |url=https://www.cbr.com/hawkman-new-dc-comics-series-venditti-hitch/ |website=CBR |date=March 14, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Fictional character biographies==\n===Carter Hall===\n{{Main|Hawkman (Carter Hall)}}\n\nIn the days of [[ancient Egypt]], Prince Khufu is engaged in a feud with his rival, the [[Egypt]]ian [[priest]] [[Hath-Set]]. The priest eventually captures both Khufu and his consort Chay-Ara, and kills them using a cursed dagger of Nth metal. Millennia later, in 1940, Khufu is reincarnated as [[United States|American]] [[archaeologist]] '''Carter Hall''', Chay-Ara as Shiera Saunders, and Hath-Set as scientist Anton Hastor. After touching the same Nth Metal dagger used to kill Khufu, Carter regains the memories of his former life and realizes Hastor is the reincarnation of his ancient foe. When Hastor kidnaps Shiera, using a magic spell to draw her to his lair, Hall uses his newly-refound memories to craft a gravity-defying belt using Nth metal and a winged costume to become Hawkman. Carter successfully rescues Shiera, Anton is killed by electrocution, and Carter and Saunders begin a romantic relationship.\n\nCarter Hall and Shiera Saunders had a son together, named Hector Hall, who grew up to also have a superheroic identity as Silver Scarab and later adopted the mantle of [[Doctor Fate|Dr. Fate]]. Hector Hall was a member of the superhero groups Infinity Inc. and the JSA, where he served alongside his father.\n\n===Katar Hol===\n{{Main|Hawkman (Katar Hol)}}\n\n'''Katar Hol''' is an honored [[police officer]] on his homeworld of Thanagar. Along with his wife Shayera, they use the anti-gravity belts and their wings to fly and fight criminals. These were the tools of an elite police unit tasked to track and apprehend the most dangerous criminals. The pair were sent to Earth in 1961 to capture the shape-shifting criminal [[Byth]]. Following this mission, they elected to remain on Earth to work with authorities in the [[United States]] and learn human police methods. The two adopted covers as a pair of [[museum]] curators, Carter and Shiera Hall, and acted publicly as the second Hawkman and the second [[Hawkwoman#Shayera Hol|Hawkgirl]] (later Hawkwoman).\n\nAlthough initially depicted as surviving the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' intact, Katar Hol was [[reboot (fiction)|reboot]]ed just a few years afterwards in a prestige-format [[miniseries]] named ''[[Hawkworld]]'', by [[Timothy Truman]]. A regular ongoing series of the same name followed, with writer [[John Ostrander]] joining Truman. Katar Hol, a young [[police]] officer on the planet Thanagar, rebels against the oppressive system of his planet and is sent into exile. He later escapes and uncovers a renegade police captain [[Byth]]. As a result, he is reinstated into the force, given a new partner, Shayera Thal, and sent on a mission on Earth, where he is the third Hawkman.\n\nIn DC's [[The New 52]] universe, Hawkman is Katar Hol but uses the name Carter Hall.\n\n===Fel Andar===\n{{Main|Hawkman (Fel Andar)}}\n\nLate in the 1980s, Thanagarian [[spy]] '''Fel Andar'''\u2014who had been living on Earth for some time already\u2014fell in love with an Earth woman, Sharon Parker, and they had a son named Charley. Andar was ordered by the Thanagarian government to infiltrate the Justice League and Parker's memories were altered so that she believed she was Hawkwoman and believed that her son was \"Carter Hall Jr.\" instead of Andar's son. Charley Andar later took up the name Hawkman to honor his \"father\" whom he believed to be Carter Hall. When Parker's old memories surface, she exposed Andar's infiltration plot; Andar murdered her and fled to Thanagar. Andar later returned to Earth to help his son become the hero known as [[Golden Eagle (comics)|Golden Eagle]], and saved his life once before being recaptured and returned to Thanagar.\n\n===Zauriel===\n{{Main|Zauriel}}\n\nWhen [[Grant Morrison]] revived the ''[[JLA (comic book)|JLA]]'' comic book in 1997, they expanded the roster to include over a dozen heroes. With frequent collaborator [[Mark Millar]], they intended to create a new Hawkman with no links to the old characters. This new Hawkman, an Earth-bound angel of the \"Eagle host\" named '''Zauriel''', was to be introduced into the JLA with issue #6 (June 1997). Morrison was denied permission to use the name \"Hawkman\" by DC editorial, which still considered it \"radioactive\", due to the complex post-Crisis continuity problems with the character.\n\nIn the ''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]] JLA Special'', Morrison made an appeal to the fanbase, \"It's a good name and it seems a shame to let it go to waste. We're hoping that fans will figure 'For God's sake, let's just call him Hawkman and get him in the Justice League as Hawkman,' and the editors will relent. We're hoping to start a campaign.\" DC held firm, and the \"Hawkman\" name went unused for several more years.<ref>[http://www.madwomb.com/madwomb/web/npo/community/archive_grantmorrison2.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060318151547/http://www.madwomb.com/madwomb/web/npo/community/archive_grantmorrison2.html |date=March 18, 2006 }}</ref>\n\n===Charley Parker===\n{{Main|Golden Eagle (comics)}}\n\nOriginally the [[Teen Titans]] member called '''Golden Eagle''', '''Charley Parker''' was presumed deceased after an attack by the [[Wildebeest (comics)|Wildebeest Society]] during the event known as ''Titans Hunt''. He was later revealed to be alive in the fourth volume of ''Hawkman'' and went on to assist the Carter Hall Hawkman for some time. When Carter Hall seemingly perished, Charley Parker took on the mantle and became the fourth Hawkman, and revealed himself as the son of Carter Hall. In fact, he was actually the son of Fel Andar, and had been responsible for Carter's troubles and his apparent demise. Carter Hall eventually defeated the Golden Eagle, their vendetta was later dropped, and Carter Hall reclaimed his mantle.\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nAll incarnations of Hawkman used the fictional \"enth metal\" or \"Nth metal\" to defy [[gravity]] and allow them to [[flight|fly]]. The metal is in their costume's belt, boots, and wings. Its abilities are controlled mentally. Their wings allow them to control their flight, though they can be \"flapped\" through use of shoulder motions. In most comic books, Hawkman is known to have slightly [[Enhanced strength|enhanced physical strength]].\n\nThe [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] Hawkman was also granted the ability to [[Aquatic respiration|breathe underwater]] by the sea god [[Poseidon]].<ref>''Flash Comics'' #9</ref> He also discovered a hidden kingdom of [[Sentience|sentient]] [[Bird|birds]] led by the old One-Eye, who taught him their language and later sacrificed himself to save Hawkman's life.<ref>''Flash Comics'' #23</ref> Among the leading birds was a [[hawk]] named Big Red who became a companion and even helped the Golden Age Hawkman solve crimes.<ref>''Flash Comics'' #24</ref>\n\nThe [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]] Hawkman also had enhanced senses comparable to a hawk's. He, and sometimes the Golden Age Hawkman as well, were also able to converse with birds, though they could not command them in the same way that, say, [[Aquaman]] could command sea creatures. Hawkman also wore special contact lenses that allowed him to detect beams and radiation.<ref>''Justice League of America'' #32</ref>\n\nThe Silver Age Hawkman also possessed a [[List of alien races in DC Comics#T|Thanagarian]] police space ship and a variety of [[science fiction]] weapons.\n\nAll versions of Hawkman prefer to use [[Ancient weapons|archaic weaponry]]\u2014particularly [[mace (bludgeon)|mace]]s, [[Net (device)|net]]s, [[spear]]s, and [[shield]]s\u2014rather than modern or futuristic weapons. The current incarnation prefers this in part because, having the memories of having lived through [[Past life regression|many past lives]], he is more proficient in their use than with contemporary weapons. In Katar Hol's case, it was too dangerous to use Thanagarian weaponry since there was too great a chance they could be lost or captured and then used or duplicated on Earth. There is, however, one significantly unique weapon Carter employs occasionally: the Claw of Horus. Constructed of Nth metal by Prince Khufu in [[ancient Egypt]], it was delivered to the newly resurrected Carter Hall by the time-displaced [[Flash (Jay Garrick)|Jay Garrick]] in ''[[Justice Society of America|JSA]]'' Book 3: \"The Return of Hawkman\". Later, in ''Superman-Batman'' Book 1: \"Public Enemies\", Hawkman used it to defeat [[Superman]], using its Nth metal to channel the Earth's gravitational field. As he explained to Superman, \"Essentially, I just hit you with the planet.\"\n\nAll versions of Hawkman have shown enhanced levels of strength. The Golden Age Hawkman was said to have the strength of 12 men but later that idea was dropped. Where as the Golden Age Hawkman's strength appeared natural, it was later explained (with the \n[[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]] Hawkman) that the Nth metal enables its wielders to carry great weights. The recent incarnation has interpreted this as the Nth metal simply enhancing the strength of the user. Also, several JLA and JSA stories indicate that Thanagar has greater gravity than Earth, and that Thanagarians are naturally stronger than humans because they are adapted to it, similarly to how [[Atlantis (DC Comics)|Atlanteans]] (e.g. [[Aquaman]]) are adapted to [[Water pressure|deep sea pressures]].\n\nIt has also been explained in the ''JSA'' series that the Nth metal greatly aids in healing, [[Regeneration in humans|closing wounds almost instantaneously]]. One example is in the ''JLA'' story \"Crisis of Conscience\", in issues 115\u2013118, when Carter's arm is nearly severed during one part of the issue, but the wound has obviously closed and functionality returned by the end of the issue. [[Atom (character)|The Atom]] has commented that Hawkman laughs at anything less than [[Third degree burns|third-degree burns]].\n\nThe Nth metal also regulates the [[Human body temperature|body temperature]] of the wearer, preventing the need for heavy protective clothing while in [[high altitudes]]. It also has the property of radiating heat, which can be controlled to warm the wearer in colder climates.<ref>''Flash Comics'' #18</ref>\n\n==Other versions==\n* During the chronal disruptions of ''[[Zero Hour: Crisis in Time!|Zero Hour]]'', multiple versions of Hawkman (and [[Hawkgirl]]/[[Hawkwoman]]) from alternate timelines were appearing in and out of existence.
