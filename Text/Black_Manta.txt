In this origin, the [[African Americans|African American]] child who would become Black Manta grew up in [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]], and loved to play by [[the Chesapeake Bay]]. In his youth, he was kidnapped and forced to work on a ship for an unspecified amount of time, where he was physically abused by his captors. At one point, he saw Aquaman with his [[dolphin]] friends and tried to signal him for help but was not seen. Finally, he was forced to defend himself, killing one of his tormentors on the ship with a knife.<ref name=Guide>{{cite book |last1=Cowsill |first1=Alan |last2=Irvine |first2=Alex |last3=Korte |first3=Steve |last4=Manning |first4=Matt |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |last6=Wilson |first6=Sven |title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia: The Definitive Guide to the Characters of the DC Universe |date=2016 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-5357-0 |page=45}}</ref> Hating the emotionless sea and Aquaman, whom he saw as its representative, he was determined to become its master.<ref name=\"aquaman6\">''Aquaman'' vol. 4 #6, 1993, DC Comics, writer Shaun McLaughlin</ref>\n\nAn alternative version was given in #8 of the 2003 ''Aquaman'' series. In this origin, the boy who would become Black Manta was an autistic orphan placed in [[Gotham City]]'s [[Arkham Asylum]]. He felt comfortable in freezing cold water but found cotton sheets excruciatingly painful. Because the attendants at Arkham did not know how to deal with autism, they would end up restraining him to the bed as he struggled and screamed whenever they tried putting him to bed. In this version, young Black Manta was also fascinated when he saw Aquaman on television.\n\nThe boy would end up being subjected to experimental treatments. One treatment seemed to clear the boy's head, but left him violent as a result; he killed the scientist who had administered the treatment and escaped from Arkham.<ref name=\"dc-ency\"/><ref name=\"aquaman8\">''Aquaman'' vol. 6 #8, 2003, DC Comics, writer Rick Veitch</ref>\n\nAs an adult, the man who would become Black Manta designed a costume (primarily a black wetsuit with a bug-eyed helmet, that was able to shoot rays from its eyes) and fashioned a high-tech submersible inspired by [[manta ray]]s. Taking the name Black Manta, he and his masked army became a formidable force, engaging in at least one unrecorded clash with Aquaman prior to his first appearance as a rival to the [[Ocean Master]] (and before joining the short-lived [[Injustice League]] in the [[retroactive continuity|retcon]] ''Silver Age'' third-week event).\n\nHis first name, David, is revealed in the 2010 ''[[Brightest Day]]'' storyline, although his last name has not been revealed.<ref name=\"bd9\">''Brightest Day'' #9 (September 2010)</ref>\n\nBlack Manta and Aquaman battled repeatedly over the next several years. During one of these clashes,<ref name=\"Adventure Comics #452\">''[[Adventure Comics]]'' #452 1977</ref> it is revealed that Black Manta is actually black, whose stated objective at one point was for [[black people]] to dominate the ocean after having been oppressed for so long on dry land; though it was soon revealed by [[Cal Durham]], one of his more idealistic henchmen, that Manta was more obsessed with his own personal desires. During most of his appearances, his main goals are defeating Aquaman and gaining power for himself through the conquest of [[Atlantis (DC Comics)|Atlantis]]. Finally, Manta kills Arthur Curry, Jr., Aquaman's son, which leaves Aquaman obsessed with revenge.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cowsill |first1=Alan |last2=Irvine |first2=Alex |last3=Manning |first3=Matthew K. |last4=McAvennie |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |title=DC Comics Year By Year: A Visual Chronicle |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-8578-6 |page=118}}</ref><ref name=\"Adventure Comics #452\" />\n\nBlack Manta is later transformed into a human/manta ray hybrid by the demon [[Neron (DC Comics)|Neron]] in exchange for his soul, though after a while he returns to wearing his original outfit, which covers his new appearance. At one point he engages in drug smuggling from his new base in [[Star City (comics)|Star City]], where he is opposed by a returning [[Green Arrow]] and Aquaman.\n\nIn a later confrontation, Aquaman, sporting the [[Lady of the Lake]]'s Healing Hand, reverses Neron's alterations to Black Manta and rewires Manta's afflicted brain, rendering him neurotypical for the first time in his life. Unfortunately, Manta remains a violent criminal, lulling Aquaman into a false sense of partnership and almost killing the Sea King in the process.\n\nIn later events, Black Manta is used as a genetic manipulation test subject to make water breathers. This succeeds; since then, Black Manta has returned to the oceans to face Aquaman once again.\n\nBlack Manta causes a disturbance in [[Sub Diego]] in which Captain Marley is severely injured.<ref>''Aquaman'' vol. 4 #39</ref> Aquaman summons various predatory sea-life to attack Black Manta and leaves him for dead. It is later revealed that Black Manta was able to survive by generating an electric charge with his suit.\n\n[[One Year Later]], he overtakes Sub Diego but is forced to flee when [[King Shark]] bites off his face.<ref>''Aquaman: Sword of Atlantis'' #52\u201353 (July\u2013August 2007)</ref>\n\nWhen Aquaman dies at the end of the 2003 series, Black Manta begins working for [[Libra (DC Comics)|Libra]] as part of the [[Secret Society of Super Villains]]. However, after Libra betrays the group and helps [[Darkseid]] conquer the Earth, Black Manta quits.\n\n===Brightest Day===\nIn a 2011 ''[[Brightest Day]]'' storyline called \"Aquawar\", Black Manta has retired from his criminal ways. He has opened a fish market to earn an honest living. When he discovers that Aquaman has been resurrected following the end of the ''[[Blackest Night]]'', Black Manta murders the customers in the store and burns down his shorefront house as he resumes his criminal career and vendetta against Aquaman.<ref>''Brightest Day'' #1 (May 2010)</ref> Black Manta is seen later at the grave of Thomas Curry, Aquaman's father, where he is approached by Siren {{Citation Needed|date=August 2022}} and her Death Squad after demolishing the tombstone. The Death Squad battles Black Manta, but before the fight continues too long, Siren stops them. She informs Black Manta that they need to work together to find his son, showing him a hard water image of [[Aqualad (Kaldur'ahm)|Jackson Hyde]].<ref name=bd9 />\n\nBlack Manta and Siren locate Jackson and attempt to kill his foster father. Jackson (using his ability to create hard water constructs) fights back but is unable to stop Black Manta from shooting a trident-shaped dart at his foster father. At the last moment, Aquaman intervenes, blocking the fatal shot. Black Manta then faces his old nemesis again.<ref>''Brightest Day'' #10 (September 2010)</ref> During the battle, Aquaman pulls Jackson and his foster father to safety.<ref>''Brightest Day'' #11 (October 2010)</ref>\n\nIn a flashback, it is revealed that Black Manta was once a treasure hunter who, along with his wife, was captured while exploring the [[Bermuda Triangle]].<ref name=\"bd16\">''Brightest Day'' #16 (December 2010)</ref> Their captors were the other-dimensional residents of Xebel, and the two were tortured mercilessly. The captors experimented on Black Manta's pregnant wife which gave the unborn child powers similar to those of the residents of Xebel.<ref name=\"bd16\" /> Fearing the child (Jackson) would be used as a pawn in an invasion of Earth, Xebel princess Mera kidnapped the child and took him to Earth, where she arranged him to be adopted and raised far away from water in order to keep him from her people.<ref name=\"bd16\" /> Black Manta ultimately escaped from Xebel, though his wife ultimately died.<ref name=\"bd16\" />\n\nAfter Jackson learns the truth behind his origin, Aquaman and Jackson (now calling himself Aqualad) are ambushed by Siren and the Xebel soldiers on a California beach, where innocent citizens become caught in the crossfire. As Aquaman is about to strike back at Siren, Black Manta springs from the water and severs Aquaman's right hand.<ref>''Brightest Day'' #19 (February 2011)</ref> Jackson attacks his father, berating him for siding with the people who killed his own wife, only for Black Manta to throw Jackson to the ground and coldly state that both he and his mother meant nothing to him. As Black Manta prepares to impale his son with one of his blades, Mera arrives with [[Aquagirl (Lorena Marquez)|Aquagirl]], who saves Jackson by striking Black Manta in the face. Jackson and Mera work together to seal Black Manta, Siren, and the rest of the invaders away in the Bermuda Triangle. Black Manta vows from within the prison to get his son, Jackson.<ref>''Brightest Day'' #20 (February 2011)</ref>\n\n===The New 52===\nIn [[The New 52]] (a 2011 reboot of the DC Comics universe), Black Manta kills a woman named Kahina the Seer, a former teammate of Aquaman, and steals her Atlantean relic. He then vows to kill her entire family before getting his revenge on Aquaman.<ref>''Aquaman'' vol. 7 #7 (March 2012)</ref> A flashback shows that Aquaman created a team known as the Others (forged of six Atlantean relics from the Dead King's tomb) who are trying to catch Black Manta, but they fail and Black Manta escapes. Black Manta goes after Aquaman's former teammate Prisoner-of-War in [[Heidelberg]].<ref>''Aquaman'' vol. 7 #8 (April 2012)</ref>\n\nIt is then revealed that Aquaman killed Black Manta's father by accident in retaliation for attacking Aquaman's father.<ref name=\"a9\">''Aquaman'' vol. 7 #9 (May 2012)</ref><ref name=\"a10\">''Aquaman'' vol. 7 #10 (June 2012)</ref> Seeking revenge, Black Manta attempted to kill all of Aquaman's family and friends. When Black Manta chased Prisoner-of-War, he was confronted by Aquaman in a battle.<ref name=\"a9\" /> During the attack, Black Manta stole one of Ya'Wara's Atlantean relics and teleported to Stephen Shin, Aquaman's former friend.<ref name=\"a10\" /> Black Manta then tasered Mera and pulled Shin to him in order to teleport away.\n\nMeanwhile, the Others were reunited and discovered that there was a seventh Atlantean relic in the Dead King's tomb. Manta took Shin captive in the Dead King's tomb in order to find the seventh relic and located in the Dead King's throne.<ref>''Aquaman'' vol. 7 #11 (July 2012)</ref> Manta prepared to kill Shin but was thwarted when Aquaman and the Others attacked his henchmen. Black Manta killed Vostok-X and escaped with the relic scepter. After Vostok-X's death, Aquaman, through tears, swore that he would kill Manta in revenge.<ref>''Aquaman'' vol. 7 #12 (August 2012)</ref> Black Manta delivered the relic scepter to [[Nuidis Vulko|a mysterious Atlantean]], who was revealed to be his employer, but the Others ambushed them and attacked. The mysterious Atlantean managed to grab the relic scepter and escape while Black Manta was forced to battle the Others, resulting in Manta and his henchmen being taken away by the authorities.<ref>''Aquaman'' vol. 7 #13 (October 2012)</ref> While in Belle Reve Prison, Black Manta refused to join [[Amanda Waller]]'s [[Suicide Squad]].<ref>''Aquaman'' vol. 7 #14 (November 2012)</ref>\n\nDuring the ''[[Forever Evil]]'' storyline, Amanda Waller approached Black Manta again to join the Suicide Squad. Black Manta declined again at the same time as Deathstorm and [[Power Ring (DC supervillains)|Power Ring]] invade Belle Reve.<ref>''Forever Evil'' #1</ref> After hearing Amanda Waller's offer to join the Suicide Squad, Black Manta retrieved his equipment during Belle Reve's prison break and accepted the Secret Society's coin. At the Justice League's Watchtower, after claiming Aquaman's trident, Black Manta tossed the coin in the ocean. Black Manta took the trident to his father's grave stating his quest to kill Aquaman was over. Looking up, he witnessed [[Ultraman (DC Comics)|Ultraman]] moving the moon in front of the sun resulting in the creation of massive tidal waves. The waves washed the grave of Black Manta's father away which gave him a new purpose: to destroy the [[Crime Syndicate of America|Crime Syndicate]].<ref>''Aquaman'' vol. 7 #23.1</ref> After retrieving Black Adam's body from the ocean, Black Manta met up with Lex Luthor, the Kryptonian clone that Lex Luthor created, and Captain Cold, where he informed them of what Ultraman's actions did to his father's grave. Lex Luthor realizes that with the help of his Kryptonian clone, Black Adam, Black Manta, and Captain Cold, he might be able to stop the Crime Syndicate.<ref>''Forever Evil'' #3</ref>\n\n===DC Rebirth===\n{{expand section|date=March 2017}}\n\n====The Drowning====\nBlack Manta's first ''Rebirth'' appearance was in the one-shot ''Aquaman: Rebirth'' #1, acting as the narrator until he reveals himself at the very end. Manta later appeared in ''Aquaman'' vol. 8 #1, in which he attacks Spindrift Station, an Atlantean embassy built by Aquaman near his hometown of Amnesty Bay to promote relations between Atlantis and the surface. Black Manta fights with Aquaman, and even wounds him, but the fight is ended with words about how hollow and empty Black Manta's purpose in life truly is. He's eventually taken into custody by the U.S. military, but the vehicle transporting him is attacked by N.E.M.O forces.<ref>{{cite book|title=Aquaman #2}}</ref> A woman named Blackjack takes him to the organization's base in Antarctica, where he meets the Fisher King. N.E.M.O plans to discredit Aquaman in the eyes of the world by manipulating conflicts with the United States and other surface nations, and Black Manta decides to continue this mission after killing the Fisher King and claiming the title for himself.<ref name=\"Aquaman #6\">{{cite book|title=Aquaman #6}}</ref> In ''Aquaman'' vol. 8 #7, Manta appears at a meeting of the N.E.M.O board in Venice, Italy, where he kills those who oppose his rule as the Fisher King and commands the Shaggy Man to attack Atlantis. Later, Manta oversees N.E.M.O's usage of Atlantean pretender forces against the U.S, which prompts the nation to declare war on Atlantis.<ref>{{cite book|title=Aquaman #11}}</ref> After a team of American Aquamarines, super soldiers who can take on the form of sharks and other aquatic creatures, fails to assassinate Aquaman,<ref>{{cite book|title=Aquaman #14}}</ref> the Atlantean king attacks Black Manta on his ship in the Azores in issue #15. Rather than surrender, Black Manta blows up the ship and all aboard, but Aquaman and Blackjack escape.\n\n====Rise of Aqualad/Blood of Manta====\nIt is revealed that Manta survived the explosion, perhaps with the help of Blackjack, and has become obsessed with finding his illegitimate son Jackson Hyde, who has joined the Teen Titans.<ref>{{cite book|title=Teen Titans #7}}</ref> Manta's desire to find him stems from his remembrance of a lost relic with power over the sea itself, '''The Black Pearl''', a weapon which can bend the very oceans to the user's whim, which once belonged to a notorious Atlantean pirate who died in Xebel. Knowing only a denizen of Xebel had the map to its keep and only Xebelian hands could unseal it, he nearly murdered Hyde's mother in order to get to him.<ref>{{cite book|title=Teen Titans #9-10}}</ref> With his son in tow, Manta and Jackson set out to find his prize, needing his son to unlock the trove that the pearl was sealed in. Eventually, a clash broke out between him and the Teen Titans after achieving his goal and with it, power to dominate the world. He was finally bested by [[Aqualad (Kaldur'ahm)|Aqualad]], who near fatally electrocuted him before taking the pearl ring from his hand.<ref name=\"Teen Titans #11\">{{cite book|title=Teen Titans #11}}</ref>\n\n====The Society====\nHe's later seen having joined up with ''The Secret Society'', who've recently sent for Deathstroke due to previous misconduct against fellow member [[Deadline (DC Comics)|Deadline]].<ref>{{cite book|title=''Deathstroke'' (2016 'Rebirth' series) #23-24}}</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nBlack Manta possesses a keen scientific mind and is an expert in mechanical [[engineering]] and [[military tactics]]. Despite being a skilled [[hand-to-hand combat]]ant and [[Swordsmanship|swordsman]], he generally relies more on technology and strategic planning than direct physical confrontations.\n\nAs a result of the serum that cured him of his autism, Black Manta possesses some degree of advanced stamina and endurance. He utilizes a nigh-invulnerable [[powered exoskeleton|battle suit]] that further enhances his physical strength and durability to superhuman levels, allowing him to lift and throw cars with ease. Due to this, David with his suit can lift an additional 5000 Ibs more than without the suit. This armor is [[Adaptation|adapted]] to an oceanic environment, providing complete resistance to deep sea pressures and granting Black Manta the ability to breathe underwater. The suit also includes a jet pack propulsion system that functions in or out of water, a [[telepathy|telepathic]] scrambler, and a wide array of different weapons and gadgets including twin swords, a hand trident, a wrist-mounted [[speargun]] on the right arm, a [[harpoon]], deployable miniaturized [[torpedo]]es, and a diving helmet that can discharge powerful optic blasts from the eye lenses. Black Manta often uses unique vehicles, such as a modified manta ray-shaped [[submarine]], for traveling underwater.\n\nAt one point, Black Manta was transformed by the demon Neron into a human-manta ray hybrid in exchange for his soul, which allowed him to breathe underwater without the use of his suit. This transformation has since been undone by Aquaman.<ref name=\"dc-ency\"/> For a brief time, Black Manta possessed a powerful mystical relic named \"The Black Pearl\", a powerful Atlantean artifact that allowed him to control the oceans at will.<ref name=\"Teen Titans #11\"/>\n\n==Other versions==\n\n===Justice===\nBlack Manta appeared as one of the major villains in the 2005-2006 ''[[Justice (DC Comics)|Justice]]'' miniseries by [[Alex Ross]] and [[Jim Krueger]] as part of the [[Legion of Doom]]. This version appears to be based on the time period when Black Manta fought for African Americans as shown by all of his henchmen being black and his city being completely populated by African Americans. He is first seen luring Aquaman into an ambush and controlling Aquaman's sharks into attacking him before taking Aquaman to [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]]. When [[Lex Luthor]] makes his speech to the world to join him in saving it, Black Manta is one of the villains alongside him.\n\nAs the Legion begins kidnapping the people close to the heroes, Black Manta takes control of [[Garth (comics)|Garth]] and forces him to assault [[Mera (comics)|Mera]] and kidnap Aquaman's son. During the Justice League's attack on the Hall of Doom, Black Manta faces off against Aquaman for the entire battle. Black Manta is one of the few villains to escape the Justice League and teleport to his city along with Aquaman's son, who follows behind him. Aquaman eventually finds Black Manta's hideout, but Black Manta's men savagely beat him in front of his son, comparing it to the treatment of his own people. Aquaman counters Black Manta is doing the same by using [[Doctor Sivana]]'s technology to control his men, smashing the pack on Black Manta's suit to free his henchmen from Black Manta's control. Black Manta realizes that Aquaman was right, but makes one last effort to kill him in desperation. He is quickly struck down by Aquaman, saying that Black Manta never really had a chance to begin with.\n\n===JLA/Avengers===\nBlack Manta appears in ''[[JLA/Avengers]]'' #4 where he is shown trapped by [[Plastic Man]].\n\n===Flashpoint===\nIn the alternate timeline of the ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' event, Black Manta was an inmate at the [[Legion of Doom (Super Friends)|Doom prison]] before the prison break.<ref>''Flashpoint: Legion of Doom'' #2 (July 2011)</ref>\n\n==In other media==\n===Television===\n[[File:Black_Manta_Young_Justice.jpg|180px|thumb|right|Black Manta as depicted in ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]'']]\n* Black Manta appears in the ''Aquaman'' segments of ''[[The Superman/Aquaman Hour of Adventure]]'', voiced by [[Ted Knight]].\n* Black Manta (referred to simply as Manta) appears in ''[[The All-New Super Friends Hour]]'', voiced again by Ted Knight.\n* Black Manta appears as a member of the [[Legion of Doom]] in ''[[Challenge of the Super Friends]]'', voiced by [[Ted Cassidy]].\n* A character based on Black Manta named '''Devil Ray''' appears in ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'', voiced by [[Michael Beach]].
