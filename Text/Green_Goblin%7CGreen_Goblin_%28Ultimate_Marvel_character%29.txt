Dafoe reprised his role as Norman Osborn in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU) film ''[[Spider-Man: No Way Home]]'' (2021) which used the concept of the [[Multiverse (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|multiverse]] to link The Raimi trilogy to the MCU.\n\n==Publication history==\n[[File:Amazing Spider-Man no, 14 (1964) (cover).jpg|thumb|left|''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #14 (July 1964), the Green Goblin's first appearance; the character originally used a turbo-fan-powered \"flying [[broom]]stick\".

In later appearances, it is established that due to the \"Goblin Formula\", Norman and most successors to the Green Goblin persona possesses superhuman strength (lifting nine tons under optimal conditions), increased speed, reflexes, endurance, intelligence and healing rate, while Norman started with a portion of the chemical's power because of an accidental splash in the face during the time where one had to bathe in it long enough to get the full effect before the drinking version was created. Though much slower than the likes of [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], he can regenerate damaged tissue and organs. However, if seriously wounded, it would leave scars on his body. His intelligence has been enhanced to gifted levels, though at the price of his sanity. His involvement with the Gathering of the Five loosened his grip on reality, though he is able to maintain some semblance of his sanity via chemically treated dermal patches. When not impaired by mental illness, Osborn is a cunning businessman, masterful strategist, and highly skilled in electronics, mechanics, engineering and chemistry. The Green Goblin is armed with a variety of bizarre devices. He travels on his [[bat]]-shaped \"Goblin Glider\", an incredibly fast and maneuverable rocket glider equipped with various armaments. Other weapons the Goblin uses include incendiary Pumpkin Bombs and Ghost Bombs, smoke- and gas-emitting grenades resembling jack-'o'-lanterns and ghosts, respectively, razor-edged [[boomerang]]-like throwing weapons called razor bats and gloves woven with micro-circuited filaments which channel pulsed discharges of electricity at nearly 10,000 [[volt]]s. He wears a green costume underneath bulletproof [[Mail (armour)|chainmail]] with an overlapping purple tunic. His mask has a built-in gas filter to keep him safe from his own gases.\n\n===Goblin Glider===\nIn the Green Goblin's first appearance in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #14, he rides a steel rocket-powered wingless broomstick (not a glider). In his second appearance in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #17, he changes to the familiar bat-shaped glider. The Goblin Glider's controls and [[microprocessor]] are located behind the head of the glider. The pilot is attached to the glider via [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] clasps on the wings of the glider. It has great maneuverability and is steered mostly by leaning, but manual controls are available behind the head of the glider. The Goblin later added radio-linked voice controls to his mask. Its top speed is {{convert|90|mi/h|km/h}}, and it can support about {{convert|400|lb|abbr=on}}, though it could lift far more for brief periods. Flying at top speed with a full load and a full fuel tank would deplete its fuel supply in about an hour.\n\nIn the Goblin's later appearances, the glider possesses a wide array of armaments, including heat-seeking and smart missiles, machine guns, extending blades, a flamethrower and a Pumpkin Bomb dispenser/launcher.\n\n===Pumpkin Bombs, Ghost Bombs, and the \"Bag of Tricks\"===\nA grenade used by the Green Goblin, the Pumpkin Bomb resembles a miniature [[Jack-o'-lantern]] and, when thrown, ignites almost soundlessly and produces enough heat to melt through a {{convert|3|in|mm|adj=on}} thick sheet of steel. The Goblin carries these and a variety of other weapons, such as razor bats (akin to bladed boomerangs) and miniature \"Ghost Bombs\", in an over-the-shoulder satchel he calls his \"Bag of Tricks\". The Green Goblin has a range of other \"Pumpkin Bombs\" and \"Ghost Bombs\" at his disposal, including smoke and gas-emitting bombs. Some release hallucinogenic gases, while others emit a specially-created mixture that neutralizes [[Spider-Man]]'s spider-sense for a limited period of time. Still others emit a flame-retarding gas, which the Goblin once used against the [[Human Torch]].<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man '' #17. Marvel Comics.</ref> All of these are covered in a light plastic coating.\n\n==Groups==\n===Goblinettes===\nSome time after Norman's death, Harry is abducted by a trio of mysterious female Goblins. With the aid of [[Ben Urich]] and [[Molten Man]], Spider-Man discovers that these \"Goblinettes\" are robots created by Harry, and controlled by a supercomputer containing copies of Harry and Norman's minds. The Goblinettes are destroyed along with the computer, which had been programmed to expose Normie Osborn to the same version of Goblin serum that killed Harry, in attempt to create a new Green Goblin.<ref>''Spider-Man: Legacy of Evil''</ref>\n\n===Order of the Goblin===\nAn offshoot of the Scriers cult founded by Norman, consisting of only his most loyal followers.\n\n===Goblin Gangs===\nFollowing Norman's [[Dark Reign (comics)|rise]] and [[Siege (comics)|fall]] from power, a number of Goblin Gangs sprang up across America. Composed mostly of white supremacists who agreed with his plans to remove the [[Asgardians (Marvel Comics)|Asgardians]] from the country, they wear purple clothes, green face makeup and have goblin-based tattoos.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #649</ref> [[Vin Gonzales]] was revealed to have received one of these tattoos while in prison passing a message from Norman to Harry about Stanley Osborn.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #647</ref>\n\n===Goblin Nation===\nThe Goblin Nation, also known as the Goblin Underground, is a group of organized crime composed of Goblin-themed villains led by the Goblin King against the [[Superior Spider-Man]].<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #10 (July 2013).

The character is the [[Ultimate Marvel]] version of [[Norman Osborn]], and was rendered by artist [[Mark Bagley]] to resemble actor [[Brian Dennehy]], as per writer [[Brian Michael Bendis]]'s instructions.<ref name=WizardXtra>Brucie, Dylan (March 2007). ''Ultimate Spider-Man''. ''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard Xtra]]!''. p. 117.</ref>\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nNorman Osborn is a corrupt [[industrialist]] and [[scientist]] who is trying to perfect the [[Supersoldier|Super Soldier]] drug for [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], an obsession that leads to the neglect of his wife [[Emily Osborn|Martha Osborn]] and son [[Harry Osborn#Ultimate Marvel|Harry Osborn]]. When an [[OZ (Ultimate Marvel)|OZ]]-injected spider bites [[Spider-Man (Ultimate Marvel character)|Peter Parker]] on a field trip,<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> and develops amazing abilities, Norman theorizes that if the OZ combined with spider DNA were behind Parker's abilities of a spider, then Norman with OZ combined with his ''own'' DNA would become a heightened version of himself. But his experiment goes wrong and an explosion occurs, affecting his son and Dr. [[Doctor Octopus#Ultimate Marvel|Otto Octavius]].<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> He himself is transformed into a muscular, grotesque, goblin-looking monster, granting him superhuman strength, reflexes, stamina, speed and durability, and enabling him to leap great distances. He is also pyrokinetic, as he can throw flaming balls of destructive energy. In an attempt to destroy all evidence of his existence, the Green Goblin kills Norman's wife but Harry manages to escape while the house is burning down.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref> The next day, he attacks Harry's school, but is stopped by Spider-Man. During the fight, the Green Goblin plummets off a bridge into the river, seemingly dead.<ref>{{Cite comic | Title = Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man | Issue = #1-7 |Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref> His alter-ego is later referred to as the \"Green Goblin\" by the public.\n\nHowever, Norman survives and has \"evolved\" in his words. He can now control his transformations into an intelligent incarnation of the Green Goblin via OZ injections. Due to overdosing on OZ, he suffers from [[hallucinations]]. These include seeing everything through a blood-red filter and creatures called \"plasmids\" tormenting him. Taking Harry back, Norman moves back into New York City, blaming his business rival [[Justin Hammer#Ultimate Marvel|Justin Hammer]] for the explosion.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #11. Marvel Comics.</ref> Under the Goblin's spell, he reveals himself to Parker, telling the boy to give up the Spider-Man identity and work for him, or suffer the deaths of loved ones. The Goblin tells Parker to kill the S.H.I.E.L.D. head [[Nick Fury (Ultimate Marvel character)|Nick Fury]]. When Parker refuses, the Goblin kidnaps [[Mary Jane Watson#Ultimate Marvel|Mary Jane Watson]] who he attempts to kill by hurling from the top of a bridge.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #24. Marvel Comics.</ref> Spider-Man is able to save Mary Jane and joins S.H.I.E.L.D. operatives in attacking the Goblin. The battle continues at Osborn's [[Manhattan]] [[Penthouse apartment|penthouse]], where the Goblin transforms even further after taking several more OZ injections and begins to choke the life out of Spider-Man. Harry discovers the scene, picking up a shattered window pane to jam into his father's back, reverting him to his human self. Norman is taken into S.H.I.E.L.D. custody.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #26. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nIn the ''[[Ultimate Six]]'' limited series, Norman and Doctor Octopus devise a plan to escape from prison alongside [[Electro (Marvel Comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Electro]], [[Kraven the Hunter#Ultimate Marvel|Kraven the Hunter]], and [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)#Ultimate Marvel]] which uses Norman's new ability to transform into his Green Goblin form at will. It also seems that he is no longer under the influence of the hallucinogenic \"plasmids\" with Norman stating that he has been undergoing a \"transitioning stage\" during his last confrontation with Peter. Furthermore, his speech is more coherent in his Goblin form, suggesting that he is no longer hallucinating as a result of the OZ formula. They kidnap the unmasked Peter to force to join them. Osborn considers Spider-Man to be his \"true\" son and belongs with him, so he prevents harm to Peter, but he does humiliate the boy. In a battle between the [[Sinister Six|Ultimate Six]] and the [[Ultimates]] at the [[White House]], Harry is used as Fury's trump card against the Goblin. Harry pleads with his father to stop while [[Captain America (Ultimate Marvel character)|Captain America]] convinces Peter of Osborn's lies. Norman is about to change back when [[Iron Man (Ultimate Marvel character)|Iron Man]] blasts him from behind, severely altering Norman's genes and causing him to lash out at the S.H.I.E.L.D. personnel before being shot down to Harry's horror. Once again taken into custody, Osborn is revealed to be in cryogenic suspension, with half of his face in Goblin form.<ref>''Ultimate Six'' #1-7. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nOsborn is again in a semblance of a human form and is kept in a high-security cell with other superhuman prisoners.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #112. Marvel Comics.</ref> When contacted by [[Carol Danvers]], Norman states that he will answer only to Fury; he then transforms into his Green Goblin form and breaks away from security measures, the OZ in his system having re-worked his body in a further process of what he refers to as '[[evolution]]'.<ref>{{Cite comic | Title = Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man | Issue = #112 |Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref> The reader is given a look into his state of mind. Though no longer haunted by 'plasmids', the Goblin has given in to severe paranoia, believing everyone save him to be insane, and Fury a tyrant that imprisons anyone with the power to stand up.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #112-114. Marvel Comics.</ref> In his breakout, he enlists the promised help of Electro as payback for freeing him; other supervillains that escape include [[Omega Red#Ultimate Marvel|Omega Red]], Kraven the Hunter, and [[Gwen Stacy#Ultimate Marvel|Gwen Stacy]] ([[Carnage (character)#Ultimate Marvel|Carnage]]). The Goblin's strategy upon escape is simple; Norman appears on a talk show, claiming that Fury held him in a prison against his will, just as he was on the brink of creating a drug to solve [[United States of America|America]]'s military problems. The Goblin goes into an explosive rage when confronted with a TV broadcast of a (staged) S.H.I.E.L.D. press conference with Harry declaring that Norman's evil and killed Harry's mother and ended up assaulting the S.H.I.E.L.D. [[Helicarrier]]; his son fights in a [[Hobgoblin (comics)#Ultimate Marvel|similar Goblin form]] but loses the resultant melee and is beaten to death suddenly and unexpectedly returns to his human form as his father is beating with full strength blows. With both the S.H.I.E.L.D. troops and the Goblin, horrified at what he's done, reverts to his own human form, turns around and asks to be killed. Danvers (in charge of S.H.I.E.L.D. while Fury is away) obliges him by shooting Norman in the head.<ref>{{Cite comic | Title = Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man | Issue = #117 |Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref>\n\nHowever, Norman is able to survive the incident much to the surprise of himself and Danvers and was kept in S.H.I.E.L.D. custody under observation. Despite there being no trace of OZ left in his body, he was still able to transform into his Green Goblin form. He's then able to escape, along with Spider-Man's other villains: Doctor Octopus, Electro, Sandman, Kraven and the [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Vulture]]. They escape to New York and take shelter in a building. While S.H.I.E.L.D. and the Ultimates are preoccupied with the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], Osborn informs the others that this is \"God's will\", telling them that God wants them to kill Spider-Man. When Doctor Octopus protests, the Goblin kills his former ally, accompanies the remaining villains to [[Tinkerer (Marvel Comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Elijah Stern]]'s hideout for weapons, and then proceeds to Peter's house along with the remaining villains. In the resulting battle, the Goblin is apparently killed when Spider-Man literally smashes him with a truck. But Osborn is left powered-down in wreckage with a slight smile on his face, suggesting he may still be alive.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #156-157. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nMonths before his transformation and apparent death, Norman had Dr. [[Alternative versions of Venom#Ultimate Marvel|Conrad Markus]] somehow create another OZ-injected spider which later bites [[Miles Morales]],<ref>''Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> indirectly due to [[Prowler (Marvel Comics)#Aaron Davis|Aaron Davis]] being hired by [[Donald Roxxon]].<ref>''Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man'' #28 - December 2013</ref> It's later revealed that Osborn is still alive and being held custody by S.H.I.E.L.D until he escapes to confront the new Spider-Man.<ref>{{Cite comic | Title = Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man | Issue = #156| Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref> Having escaped custody, the Goblin attacks Miles but Peter's intervention surprised everyone. It was discovered that the Oz Formula that affected Parker and Osborn gave them immortality. The Green Goblin is defeated with Osborn's body being immolated by Detective [[Maria Hill#Ultimate Marvel|Maria Hill]].<ref>''Miles Morales: Ultimate Spider-Man'' #1-7. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nFollowing the \"[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]\" storyline, the Green Goblin of Earth-1610 was restored and he was seen fighting Spider-Man and the Ultimates.<ref>''Spider-Men II'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nWhen Empire State University's engineering facility comes under attack, Morales as Spider-Man encounters the Green Goblin. When fighting him, Miles remembered this version of Goblin. During the fight with the Goblin, Miles is ambushed by a villain called [[Miles Morales#Ultimatum|Ultimatum]] who subdues with size-shifting powers. After somehow remembering Miles, Ultimatum grabs the Goblin and uses his rocket boots to make off with him.<ref>''Miles Morales: Spider-Man'' #10. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nAfter he managed to obtain a sample of the drug that Ultimatum was producing, Spider-Man II was attacked again by the Green Goblin. Miles managed to defeat the Goblin and hand him over to the police.<ref>''Miles Morales: Spider-Man'' #14. Marvel Comics.</ref> The Goblin managed to escape and use his drug to turn people into smaller versions of himself called Goblinoids. With his Goblinoids, the Goblin led them in attacking Brooklyn Visions Academy. Though he was defeated by Spider-Man II again, the Goblin got away.<ref>''Miles Morales: Spider-Man'' #15. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nIt turns out that Ultimatum has been helping the Green Goblin in making an army of Goblinoids as part of his plot to take over Brooklyn. After escaping from Ultimatum, Miles' burner clones, and Ultimatum's henchmen, Spider-Man II and the Prowler run into the Goblin and the Goblinoids.<ref>''Miles Morales: Spider-Man'' #19. Marvel Comics.</ref> As Spider-Man II and the Prowler fight the Goblinoids, the Goblin states that a pulse will go off where anyone who took the Goblinoid drug will turn into the next wave of Goblinoids. When the pulse activates, some Goblinoids attacked Captain America at the time when he was giving Miles's friends a ride. [[Jefferson Davis (comics)|Jefferson Davis]] shows up to aid Captain America in fighting the Goblinoids. Bombshell and Starling catch up to Spider-Man II and the Prowler just as the Goblin catches up to them at Prospect Park. The Goblin starts to overwhelm Spider-Man II. In the nick of time, Captain America and Jefferson arrive. Spider-Man II beats up the Goblin as Jefferson prevents him from going too far. Just then, Ultimatum arrives.<ref>''Miles Morales: Spider-Man'' #20. Marvel Comics.</ref> Ultimatum, his henchmen, and the Goblinoids attack Spider-Man II, Captain America, Jefferson, the Prowler, Bombshell, and Starling. The Goblin recovers and attacks Prowler as Ultimatum plans to send Spider-Man II back to Earth-1610. The Prowler sacrifices himself to give off a reverse ionic pulse explosion by overloading his suit. This ends up sending Ultimatum and the Goblin back to Earth-1610 causing the Goblinoids to regress back to their human form while the remaining henchmen of Ultimatum flee the area.<ref>''Miles Morales: Spider-Man'' #21. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nSince the Green Goblin's powers is derived from the OZ formula, his strength derives from how much he is exposed to. The smaller dosage gives him green claws, horns and head, though the rest of him is human like in appearance. When he returns, he uses larger dosages of OZ to become larger and completely green, with more crests. When he overdoses on OZ, his horns, stature and muscles become larger, as does the number of crests. He later develops a way to transform without OZ into a larger, more powerful form, making injections obsolete.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #226. Marvel Comics.</ref><ref>''Ultimate Six'' #1-6. Marvel Comics.</ref> This version appears to be effectively immortal, having resurrected and 'evolved' multiple times thus far despite the fact that he has been killed in multiple ways; the extent of and limitations to this conditional immortality is currently unknown.\n\n==In other media==\n===Television===\n* A variation of the Ultimate Marvel version of the Green Goblin appears in ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (TV series)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]'', voiced by [[Steven Weber]].<ref>{{cite episode|title=Rise of the Goblin|series=Ultimate Spider-Man|network=Disney XD|season=1|number=25|airdate=October 28, 2012}}</ref> This version is an amalgamation of his Ultimate iteration's green-skinned monstrous appearance, and his original incarnation's use of a glider and pumpkin bombs. \n** An alternate reality version of the Green Goblin also appears, also voiced by Weber.<ref name=\"The Spider-Verse Pt. 3\">{{cite episode|title=The Spider-Verse Pt. 3|series=Ultimate Spider-Man: Web Warriors|network=Disney XD|season=3|number=11|airdate=March 19, 2015}}</ref> This version has his Ultimate iteration's green-skinned monster appearance yet also has demon-like wings and it is mentioned that he killed his universe's Peter Parker who was later replaced by [[Miles Morales]]. Introduced in ''Ultimate Spider-Man: Web-Warriors'', he first appears when he battles the \"prime\" [[Spider-Man]] and the Ultimate Spider-Man, as well as his \"prime\" counterpart, claiming that only he is rightful of killing Spider-Man, but is ultimately defeated. The Goblin returns in ''Ultimate Spider-Man vs the Sinister Six'', where he is summoned by [[Baron Mordo]] via the Siege Perilous into the \"prime\" universe. Using the Siege Perilous' destructive capabilities, he fights Spider-Man, [[Doctor Strange]] and Kid Arachnid, forcing the latter to destroy the Siege Perilious, which leaves both Kid Arachnid and the Goblin stranded in the \"prime\" universe. The Goblin is later recruited by [[Doctor Octopus]] into the [[Sinister Six]] and takes part in the team's attack on the [[Triskelion (comics)|Triskelion]], during which he's defeated by Spider-Man.\n\n===Film===\n* The Ultimate Marvel version of the Green Goblin appears in ''[[Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse]]'', voiced by [[Jorma Taccone]].<ref>{{cite web|date=June 6, 2018|title=\"Spider-Man\u2122: Into The Spider-Verse\" Trailer Launches|url=https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/spider-man-into-the-spider-verse-trailer-launches-300660643.html|access-date=June 6, 2018|website=[[PR Newswire]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Vejvoda|first=Jim|date=November 29, 2018|title=Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse Official Credits Reveal Surprise Voice Actor Cameos|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/11/30/spider-man-into-the-spider-verse-official-credits-reveal-surprise-voice-actor-cameos|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181130210649/https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/11/30/spider-man-into-the-spider-verse-official-credits-reveal-surprise-voice-actor-cameos|archive-date=November 30, 2018|access-date=December 2, 2018|website=[[IGN]]}}</ref> While this depiction is primarily based upon the Ultimate comics iteration, visual elements from various other previous incarnations are also amalgamated into the character's design, such as wings in lieu of a glider and his signature pumpkin bombs instead of pyrokinesis.
