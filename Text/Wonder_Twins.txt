The pair can activate their superpowers by touching their rings and saying the phrase \"Wonder Twin powers, activate!\" Jayna can transform into any animal, and Zan can become water in any state. The pair also have a pet monkey, [[Gleek (Super Friends)|Gleek]], who assists in their crime-fighting activities.\n\nThey subsequently appeared in comics based on the animated series and were later introduced into the main [[DC Comics Universe]]. They have since appeared in other media, including the animated series ''[[Teen Titans Go!]]'' and the live-action TV series ''[[Smallville]]''.\n\n==Broadcast and publication history==\nThe duo made their debut in ''[[The All-New Super Friends Hour]]'' and then appeared in ''[[The World's Greatest Super Friends]]'', ''[[Super Friends (1980)|Super Friends]]'', and ''[[Super Friends: The Legendary Super Powers Show]]''. Zan (voiced by [[Michael Bell (actor)|Michael Bell]]) and Jayna (voiced by Louise Williams from 1977-1983 and [[B. J. Ward (actress)|B. J. Ward]] in 1984<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/voice-compare/DC-Universe/Jayna|title = Voice Compare - Jayna}}</ref>) are siblings from the planet Exxor (also spelled Exor) who were being informally trained by the superheroes. Unlike their predecessors, [[Wendy, Marvin and Wonder Dog|Wendy Harris and Marvin White]], this pair was able to participate in combat with abilities of their own.\n\nHanna-Barbera animator [[Darrell McNeil]] recalls the twins were created by [[Norman Maurer]], the ''[[Super Friends]]'' series developer/story editor. They were originally called Dick and Jane, and their sidekick was Mighty Monkey, before finally becoming Zan, Jayna, and Gleek. The names \"Zan\" and \"Jayna\" derived from the [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]] characters [[Tarzan]] and his romantic interest [[Jane Porter (Tarzan)|Jane]]. According to McNeil: \"Originally Zan (Dick) had '[[Plastic Man]]' powers and Jayna (Jane) could transform into anything, not just animals, but they were scaled back to their present powers as it made the other Super Friends (even [[Superman]]) seem almost superfluous\".<ref name=\"blogspot1\">{{cite web|author=Marc Tyler Nobleman |url=http://noblemania.blogspot.com/2011/07/super-70s-and-80s-super-friendsdarrell.html |title=Noblemania: Super '70s and '80s: \"Super Friends\"\u2014Darrell McNeil, animator |publisher=Noblemania.blogspot.com |date=2011-07-29 |access-date=2013-09-10}}</ref> Jayna's distinctive [[hairdo]] was based on that of an animation checker at Hanna-Barbera, while the pointed ears were inspired by the character [[Spock]] from the ''[[Star Trek]]'' franchise. The twins' personalities were heavily based on [[Donny and Marie Osmond]], who were extremely popular at the time and had [[Donny & Marie (1976 TV series)|their own show]] on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] as well.<ref name=\"Back38\">{{cite journal|last= Schwirian|first= John|date= February 2010|title= Purple Prose: The Perplexing Popularity of the Wonder Twins |journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue= #38|pages= 59\u201364|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}</ref>\n\nThe Wonder Twins were the most prominently featured characters in their first season on ''Super Friends''. However, by the final seasons, the twins were largely marginalized in favor of well established DC Comics teenage superheroes like [[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]], and were wholly eliminated in the final season in favor of [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]].<ref name=\"Back38\"/>\n\nThe characters were introduced to comics in issue #7 of the ''Super Friends'' tie-in series (cover-dated October 1977, but published in July 1977), by [[E. Nelson Bridwell]] and [[Ramona Fradon]]. The ''Super Friends'' comic book provided considerably more details of the Wonder Twins' background and how they came to join the team than was provided in the television series. Because of the different production lag times between animation and comics, the first comic book appearance is chronologically before the first television appearance.<ref name=\"Back38\"/>\n\nIn the 1990s, they were introduced into the main [[DC Universe]] in ''[[Extreme Justice]]'' #9 (October [[1995 in comics|1995]]), by [[Ivan Velez, Jr.]] and [[Al Rio]]. The series rewrote and updated their [[origin story]]. Velez, an avowed die-hard fan of the Wonder Twins, intended to begin a revival of the characters, but was taken off the series after the first issue with the Wonder Twins. Though the twins remained with the series until its cancellation with #18, they were used only sparingly after Velez's departure.<ref name=\"Back38\"/> Following the cancellation of ''Extreme Justice'', the Wonder Twins showed up only sporadically in the DC Universe, with their last significant appearance being in 2003.\n\nDC published a six-issue ''Wonder Twins'' miniseries in 2019, written by [[Mark Russell (comics)|Mark Russell]] and drawn by [[Stephen Byrne (comics)|Stephen Byrne]].<ref>Dominguez, Noah (October 6, 2018). [https://www.cbr.com/wonder-twins-activate-first-issue-cover/ \"Wonder Twins Activate on First Issue Cover\"]. [[CBR.com]]. Retrieved November 21, 2018.</ref> The series was a critical and commercial success, and was extended into a 12 issue maxi-series.\n\nIn November 2019, the first 6 issues of \"Wonder Twins\" were collected as a trade paper back, and released under the title \"Wonder Twins - Activate\". In the following August, the second six issues of the maxi-series are being released in another trade paper back titled \"The Fall & Rise of the Wonder Twins\".\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n===''Super Friends''===\nLittle background is provided for the Wonder Twins in the ''[[Super Friends]]'' cartoon, save that they are superheroes-in-training that are friends of the Super Friends and were born on November 6.\n\nAccording to the 1977 ''Super Friends'' comic book by writer [[E. Nelson Bridwell]] and artist [[Ramona Fradon]], Zan and Jayna are Exorian. The twins are [[metahumans|metas]], genetic throwbacks to an ancient race of Exorian shapeshifters.<ref>''Super Friends'' #7 (October 1977)</ref> Their parents died when they were still babies during a plague, and, because of their origin, no Exorians want to adopt them. They are adopted by the owner of a Space [[Circus]] who only wants to use them as [[sideshow]] freaks. However, the circus' clown (or \"laugh-maker\") is a kind man and raises them. He also gives them Gleek as a pet. Eventually, as teens, the pair escapes the circus and hides on a planet where a space villain called Grax (an enemy of [[Superman]]) has established his headquarters. Spying on him, they learn that Grax is planning to destroy the Earth using hidden superbombs. The twins decide to travel to Earth and warn the [[Justice League]], which is how they come to replace Wendy and Marvin (who were planning on retiring as heroes anyway) as their sidekicks. The heroes arrange for the kids to live with an old scientist named [[Professor Carter Nichols]] and they even take secret identities as Johan and Joanna Fleming. \"Johan\" and \"Johanna\" were supposedly transfer students from Esko, [[Sweden]], disguised with blonde hair (Zan wore a wig, while Jayna used her powers to transform into a human to change her hair color and ear shape), to allow them to attend [[Gotham City]] High School.{{fact|date=May 2021}}\n\nAccording to the twins' self-titled 2019 series, Zan is older by three minutes.<ref>Russell, Mark (w), Byrne, Stephen (a). \"The Great Scramble\".

Unable to speak [[English language|English]], they inadvertently attack some civilians and the Justice League. During their fight with the JLA, Zan becomes an ice [[golem]], a water monster, and a demonic-looking [[whirlpool]], while Jayna becomes a [[griffin]], a [[werewolf]], and a sea serpent.<ref>''Extreme Justice'' #9 (October 1995)</ref> The pair are later emancipated by the Justice League and join [[Captain Atom]]'s team in issue #16 (May 1996).<ref name=\"dc-extr\">{{Citation | last = Beatty | first = Scott | author-link = Scott Beatty | contribution = Extreme Justice | editor-last = Dougall | editor-first = Alastair | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia | page = 117 | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]] | place = New York | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-0-7566-4119-1 | oclc = 213309017}}</ref> That same year, they appeared in the crossover storyline ''[[Final Night]]''<ref>[[Kesel, Karl]] (w), [[Immonen, Stuart]] (p), Marzan, Jose, Jr.(i). \"Dusk\".

DC Comics.</ref>\n\nIn February 2019, the first issue of a 6-issue mini-series was released on Wonder Comics, titled \"Wonder Twins\". It was well received and did so well in sales that it was expanded to a 12-issue maxi-series. The Wonder Comics imprint is considered part of the current DCU, so this places the Wonder Twins in current DC continuity. \n\nLater in September, the Wonder Twins had a cameo appearance in ''Action Comics'' #1015, which also guest starred new Wonder Comics hero Naomi. \n\nWonder Comics appeared in the [[fictional crossover|crossover]] storyline that begins in ''Young Justice'' vol. 3 #12, which features Naomi and the Wonder Twins as guest stars.  \n\nThe Wonder Twins appeared on the cover of ''Superman: Heroes'' #1.\n\n==Powers and abilities==\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2014}}\nThe Wonder Twins powers are activated when they touch each other and speak the phrase, \"Wonder Twin powers, activate!\" Physical contact is required. If the two are out of reach of each other, they are unable to activate their powers. As they are about to transform, they would each announce their intended form. \"Shape of...\", \"Form of...\"\n\nZan can transform into water at any state (solid, liquid, gas) and add to his mass by incorporating water in his immediate area. In the case of becoming solid ice, he can also become any form he chooses, from a {{convert|5000|ft|m|adj=on}} humanoid ice giant to a cage for a criminal to complex machinery (such as a jet engine, as he did in the episode \"Eruption\"). In the episode \"Pressure Point\", he changes into a gelatinous form. In \"Terror from the Phantom Zone\", he was able to transform into [[liquid nitrogen]]. In addition, he can transform himself into atmospheric disturbances (usually very localized) involving water, such as a [[blizzard]], a [[monsoon]], [[waterspout]] or a [[typhoon]], as he did in the episodes \"The Water Beast\", \"The Beasts are Coming\", and \"Stowaways\".\n\nJayna can transform into any animal, whether real, mythological, indigenous to Earth, or indigenous to some other planet like Exxor. Since she must vocalize her choice of form to assume, she must know the common name. As revealed in \"The Mummy of Nazca\", naming the wrong animal will cause her to assume the wrong animal's form. She has been known to take the form of anything from a mosquito to a whale, as in \"The Water Beast\" episode.\n\nIn the ''Super Friends'' comic book, their powers were shown to be more extensive. By transforming into an animal of [[Krypton (comics)|Kryptonian]] origin, for instance, Jayna could gain both the creature's natural abilities and the super-powers that all Kryptonians possess under Earth-like conditions; she was even capable of overpowering [[Superman]] in the form of a Kryptonian animal.<ref>''Super Friends'' #42 (March 1981)--Jayna defeats Superman in a training exercise by becoming a Kryptonian ''Tanthou Flez'' (\"Winged One\").</ref> Similarly, Zan was able to transform into anything tangentially related to water or ice, including a [[J\u00f6tunn|frost giant]] in the \"Demons of Exxor\" episode.\n\nIn addition to their powers of transformation, the two share a telepathic link, enabling one to alert the other over a distance when in dire circumstances, as revealed in the episode \"The Village of Lost Souls\".\n\nThe Wonder Twins have a pet Space Monkey named [[Gleek (Super Friends)|Gleek]], who has a useful prehensile tail and who can act as a conduit for the twins to activate their powers should they be out of reach. Gleek also serves as a courier when the twins need to travel: Jayna will typically transform into a large [[eagle]], and Zan will transform into [[water]], \"jumping\" into a bucket which Gleek will hold while being clutched by Jayna in her eagle form.\n\nA rarely seen aspect of their powers is the ability to break mind control. On at least two occasions (\"Pied Piper From Space\" and \"Circus of Horrors\"), while the twins were under the influence of mind control, [[Gleek (Super Friends)|Gleek]] caused them to make contact and the activation of their powers freed them instantly from the mind control.\n\n==In other media==\n===Television===\n[[Image:SmallvilleWonderTwins.jpg|200px|thumb|[[David Gallagher]] as Zan and [[Allison Scagliotti]] as Jayna in the ''[[Smallville]]'' episode \"Idol\"]]\n* In the ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' episode \"Injustice For All\", statues of the Twins are briefly seen in a museum devoted to super-powered heroes. Later in the same scene, the two statues are destroyed during the battle between the heroes and villains.\n* In ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'', two characters called '''Downpour''' and '''Shifter''' appear in the episode \"Ultimatum\" where they were both voiced by [[Grey DeLisle]]. They are members of the Ultimen, a group of superheroes created by the [[United States government|government]] and [[Project Cadmus]] with [[Maxwell Lord]] as their sponsor. The group is an analogue of the heroes that were created for ''Super Friends'', with Downpour and Shifter specifically an analogue of the Wonder Twins. Downpour and his twin sister Shifter have [[albino]] white skin, pink eyes and pointy ears. Downpour would say the name of a liquid in order to turn into that liquid (like [[flood]], [[water]], and [[Tidal bore|tidal wave]]) while Shifter would say the name of a creature (like a [[sea serpent]], a [[lion]], a [[rhinoceros]], a [[African buffalo|cape buffalo]], and a [[Tyrannosaurus]]) in order to become that creature. \n* In the late '90s, Zan and Jayna appeared in a promo for Cartoon Network where they demonstrated their powers. Zan expressed disappointment that he only transforms into \"lame\" things like water and ice. Michael Bell reprised his role as Zan for this promo.\n* Zan appeared in season one episode of the [[Adult Swim]] series ''[[Harvey Birdman: Attorney at Law]]''. Here, Zan (voiced by [[Michael Bell (actor)|Michael Bell]]) is on the stand being questioned by Harvey Birdman.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://video.adultswim.com/harvey-birdman-attorney-at-law/i-was-the-bathwater.html |title=I Was the Bathwater - Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law - Adult Swim Video |publisher=Video.adultswim.com |date=2007-06-22 |access-date=2013-09-10 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121231012337/http://video.adultswim.com/harvey-birdman-attorney-at-law/i-was-the-bathwater.html |archive-date=2012-12-31}}</ref> In 2006, the Adult Swim website ran a series of five [[webisode]]s entitled \"The New Adventures of the Wonder Twins\". These shorts were not canon, but rather a [[Black comedy|dark-humor]] [[parody]]. Zan and Jayna were portrayed as well-meaning but inept, with their attempts at heroism always ending in tragic failure.\n* In the ''[[Family Guy]]'' episode \"A Fish Out of Water\", Peter Griffin and his dog Brian put their rings together and simultaneously say \"Wonder Twin powers, activate\", after which Peter states what he wants to be changed into. Brian tells him they got the rings as a Franken Berry prize. In another episode, \"Fast Times at Buddy Cianci Jr. High\", Peter reveals that he was once one of the Wonder Twins. In his flashback, it is revealed that after activating their powers, Peter turned himself into Jayna's tampon. Jayna was voiced by [[Rachael MacFarlane]]. \n* Zan and Jayna appeared in the ''[[Smallville]]'' season nine episode, \"Idol\". Zan was played by [[David Gallagher]] and Jayna by [[Allison Scagliotti]]. They both carry cell phones that have an image of Gleek on the back and that make the sound of Gleek laughing as a [[ringtone]]. Though not explicitly indicated to be aliens, they are implied to be from another world and claim to be of [[Swedish people|Swedish]] descent in order to explain their odd-sounding names. \n* In ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'' episode \"Crazy for You\", Barry Allen rescues a man and woman by the names of Jayna and Zay from a burning car. Unlike in the comics, it appears these versions are a couple rather than twins.\n* The Wonder Twins appear in the ''[[Teen Titans Go!]]'' episode \"You're Fired\" with Zan voiced by [[Khary Payton]] and Jayna by [[Tara Strong]]. They appear among the heroes at the audition for the replacement of [[Beast Boy]].\n* The Wonder Twins' pet Gleek appears in the fifth part of the sixth annual [[Arrowverse]] crossover ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths (Arrowverse)|Crisis on Infinite Earths]]''.\n\n===Film===\n* The Wonder Twins appear in ''[[The Lego Batman Movie]]''. They are seen at the 57th Annual Justice League Anniversary Party.\n* The Wonder Twins make a brief appearance in ''[[Teen Titans Go! To the Movies]]''.\n* In February 2022, a [[DC Extended Universe|DCEU]] film centered around Zan and Jayna / Wonder Twins was announced to be in development, with [[Adam Sztykiel]] writing and directing, in his [[List of directorial debuts|directorial debut]]. Marty Bowen and [[Wyck Godfrey]] were reported as producers on the film, a joint-venture production between DC Films, [[Temple Hill Entertainment]], and [[List of HBO Max original programming #Original films|HBO Original Films]] and would star [[KJ Apa]] and [[Isabel May]] as Zan and Jayna.
