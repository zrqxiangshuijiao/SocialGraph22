The character is commonly associated with the Japanese team known as [[Big Hero 6 (comics)|Big Hero 6]]. She was created by [[Steven T. Seagle]] and [[Duncan Rouleau]], and first appeared in ''Sunfire & Big Hero 6'' #1 (September 1998). She also appeared in the [[Big Hero 6 (film)|2014 film adaptation of the comics]].\n\nHoney Lemon appears as a young American woman in the 2014 Disney animated film ''[[Big Hero 6 (film)|Big Hero 6]]'' and [[Big Hero 6: The Series|television series]], voiced by [[Genesis Rodriguez]] and in the video game ''[[Kingdom Hearts III]]''. She is a quirky chemistry whiz who has a kind heart and tries to find the good in everything. She has a purse that can mix different chemical elements, allowing her to create balls that she uses as explosives or traps.\n\n==Publication history==\nCreated by [[Steven T. Seagle]] and [[Duncan Rouleau]] in their spare time while working on another project, Honey Lemon was first intended to appear with the rest of [[Big Hero 6 (comics)|Big Hero 6]] in ''[[Alpha Flight (comic book)|Alpha Flight]]'' #17 (December 1998). However, the team first appeared in their own self-titled three-issue miniseries by writer [[Scott Lobdell]] and artist Gus Vasquez, which due to scheduling issues, was published before ''Alpha Flight'' #17.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.laughingplace.com/w/blogs/fanboy/2014/03/25/movie-week-a-look-ahead-to-big-hero-6/| work= FanBoy's Blog | publisher= LaughingPlace.com |title= MovieWeek: A Look Ahead To Big Hero 6|date=25 March 2014|accessdate=23 October 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url= https://vancouversun.com/entertainment/movie-guide/Hero+banks+huggable+robot+draw+audiences/10350057/story.html |title= Big Hero 6 banks on a huggable robot to draw in audiences |first= Christopher |last= Palmeri |work= The Vancouver Sun |agency= Bloomberg News |date= 3 November 2014 |accessdate= 8 January 2015 |archive-date= 16 December 2018 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20181216081448/http://www.vancouversun.com/entertainment/movie-guide/hero+banks+huggable+robot+draw+audiences/10350057/story.html |url-status= dead }}</ref> The character appeared with the team in a subsequent five-issue miniseries which was launched by Marvel Comics in September 2008.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nAiko Miyazaki was enrolled in the graduate program at the [[Tokyo University of Science]] when she was recruited by Naikaku J\u014dh\u014d Ch\u014dsashitsu ([[Cabinet Intelligence and Research Office|Naich\u014d]]), Japan's premiere [[intelligence agency]]. Miyazaki's sharp intellect and stunning looks made her a prime candidate for secret agent status, and she was promptly placed on a research and development team consisting of Naich\u014d's top physicists, chemists, and mechanical engineers and put to work creating new technology for the government. Although Miyazaki's team was responsible for several innovations in surveillance technology, by far their most significant invention was a cluster of artificial, miniature wormholes\u2014tiny warps and distortions in the fabric of space-time. At Miyazaki's suggestion, the wormholes were contained within an innocuous woman's purse so they could be applied in the field without attracting undue attention. It was soon discovered that the wormholes, in conjunction with [[Pym Particles]] and cutting-edge [[nanotechnology]], served as ideal storage devices in the field\u2014virtually any object, no matter how large, could be stored in Miyazaki's aptly-named \"Power Purse\" for later use.<ref name=\"Big Hero 6 #1\">''Big Hero 6'' #1 (2008)</ref>\n\nSoon after, the top-secret consortium of Japanese politicians and business entities known as the Giri began recruiting candidates for [[Big Hero 6 (comics)|Big Hero 6]], which was to become Japan's premiere superhero team. Inspired by the exploits of [[Sunfire (comics)|Sunfire (Shiro Yoshida)]], Japan's national superhero, Miyazaki persuasively lobbied her superiors in Naich\u014d for a spot on the team. Graduating to full-fledged \"secret agent\" status, Miyazaki adopted the code-name \"Honey Lemon\" (inspired by her favorite television program of the same name). As the most caring and compassionate member of the team, Honey Lemon quickly found herself at odds with teammate [[GoGo Tomago|Go-Go Tomago (Leiko Tanaka)]], a tough-talking ex-convict who felt that Honey Lemon received special treatment because of her looks and intellect. However, after several heated squabbles, the two eventually learned to appreciate one another and became good friends.<ref name=\"Big Hero 6 #1\" />\n\nShe seemingly became attracted to the team's newest potential recruit, [[Hiro Takachiho]], as she kept smiling at him in a flirtatious way. Later, Honey helped overthrow a menace called Everwraith and saved Japan from destruction.{{issue|date=April 2013}}\n\nShe was only briefly seen afterwards, helping Sunfire out in [[Canada]].{{issue|date=November 2014}} Sometime later, a mysterious individual used a machine to mind-control the entire team of Big Hero Six and they were sent to Canada once again, where they fought the newest incarnation of [[Alpha Flight]] until [[Sasquatch (comics)|Sasquatch]] discovered the plot. Honey Lemon was, along with the rest of the team, brought back to normal, and they all returned to Japan to try to discover who mind-controlled them.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #17 (1989)</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nHoney Lemon's Power Purse (also known as the \"Nano-Purse\") contains a series of miniature, artificial, inter-universe wormholes, granting her limited access to an indeterminate number of worlds and dimensions. The unstable, fluctuating nature of the wormholes makes accurate long-term mapping of them difficult. Before deploying in the field, Honey Lemon typically gathers a large arsenal of supplies, shrinks them to microscopic size using a combination of Pym Particles and cutting-edge nanotechnology, and stores them in miniature pocket universes only accessible via the Power Purse's wormholes. As such, she is able to instantaneously retrieve these items from the Power Purse and restore them to their original size while in the field.<ref name=\"Big Hero 6 #1\" />\n\nThe Power Purse's wormholes also grant access to a number of full-sized, inhabited dimensions. For instance, the Microverse planet of Coronar (home world of former Big Hero 6 member [[Sunpyre]]) is accessible through the Power Purse. The total number of dimensions accessible via the Power Purse has yet to be determined. Although Honey Lemon can use the Power Purse's wormholes as a method of personal transportation, she only does so in rare instances when her life is in danger, as a trip through the Power Purse is often a very unpleasant experience for carbon-based lifeforms.<ref name=\"Big Hero 6 #1\" />\n\nHoney Lemon is a brilliant scientist who often keeps her opponents off-guard by feigning ignorance. As a secret agent of the Naich\u014d intelligence agency, she is extensively trained in various martial arts, including aikido, judo, jujutsu, karate, Shaolin kung fu and tae kwon do.<ref name=\"Big Hero 6 #1\" />\n\n==In other media==\n\n===Film===\n{{Infobox character\n|series = [[Big Hero 6 (film)|Big Hero 6]]\n|name = Honey Lemon\n|image = Honey Lemon from Disney's Big Hero 6.png\n|image_size = 170\n|caption = [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]] re-imagining of Honey Lemon\n|first = ''[[Big Hero 6 (film)|Big Hero 6]]'' (2014)\n|last =\n|voice = [[Genesis Rodriguez]]\n|gender = Female\n|nickname = Tall Girl <small>(by Karmi)</small><ref name=\"FanFriction\">{{cite episode|title=Fan Friction|series=Big Hero 6: The Series|credits=Juwono, Ben (director); Jenny Jaffe (writer)|network=[[Disney XD]]|airdate=August 18, 2018|season=1|number=15}}</ref>\n|color = #A1126D\n}}\n\nHoney Lemon appears in ''[[Big Hero 6 (film)|Big Hero 6]]'', voiced by [[Genesis Rodriguez]].<ref>{{cite news|title='Big Hero 6\u2032: Disney Previews Its First Animated Marvel Movie at the D23 Expo|url=https://screencrush.com/big-hero-6-marvel-disney-d23/|accessdate=1 April 2014|newspaper=Screen crush|date=9 August 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"USATodayTruitt\">{{cite web|last=Truitt|first=Brian|title=Meet the saviors of San Fransokyo in 'Big Hero 6'|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2014/07/13/big-hero-6-character-reveal-exclusive/12535005/|newspaper=USA Today|accessdate=July 14, 2014|date=July 13, 2014}}</ref> In the film, Honey Lemon is depicted as a quirky chemistry whiz at the San Fransokyo Institute of Technology.
