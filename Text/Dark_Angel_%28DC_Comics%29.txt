She is a wandering spirit who inhabited the body of [[Paula von Gunther|Baroness Paula Von Gunther]] during [[World War II]]. Recently it was revealed that Dark Angel was, in fact, the [[Donna Troy]] of the pre-''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Crisis]]'' [[Multiverse (DC Comics)#Earth-Seven|Earth-Seven]], saved from certain death by the [[Anti-Monitor]]. \n\nThe character first appeared in ''Wonder Woman'' vol. 2 #131 (March 1998).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Jimenez |first1=Phil |last2=Wells |first2=John |title=The Essential Wonder Woman Encyclopedia |date=2010 |publisher=Del Rey |isbn=978-0345501073 |page=102}}</ref>\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nThe bringer of doom known as '''Dark Angel''' has long bedevilled humans foolish enough to summon her.<ref name=\"WW136\">''Wonder Woman'' #136</ref> During World War II, [[Baroness Paula Von Gunther]], (pre-''Crisis'', a brilliant Nazi saboteur who eventually became one of Wonder Woman's staunchest allies, who became post-''Crisis'' a Nazi occult mistress), called forth this wandering evil spirit, who then took over Von Gunther's body and attacked [[Hippolyta (DC Comics)|Wonder Woman]] and the [[Justice Society]] with her mythic might.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' vol. 2 #132</ref><ref>''Wonder Woman'' vol. 2 #134</ref>\n\nHippolyta battled Dark Angel on many occasions, and eventually Dark Angel appeared on [[Themyscira (DC Comics)|Themyscira]].<ref name=\"WW136\" /> She intended to kidnap Princess Diana, but instead kidnapped her magical double. She forced the double (who she thought was Diana) to live thousands of lifetimes, each one ending in tragedy. She hoped the cumulative effect would drive Hippolyta insane. Instead, the double was able to grow stronger, and finally became an independent entity now known as [[Donna Troy]].<ref>''Titans'' #23</ref>\n\nDonna Troy was able to defeat Dark Angel,<ref>''Titans'' #24</ref><ref>''Titans'' #25</ref> and at some point Dark Angel separated herself from von Gunther.

When the Multiverse was reconfigured in one single Universe, Dark Angel, who had somehow escaped the compression of every Donna Troy into one single person in the new Earth, sought to kill Donna and make her relive the lives of the other alternate Donnas as a way to avoid the merging and remain the last one standing. When Dark Angel was defeated, Donna became the real sum of every Donna Troy that existed on every Earth, a living key to the lost Multiverse.\n\n===One Year Later===\nThe continuity-altering effects of ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'' and ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' resulted in a new [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|multiverse]]. A new Dark Angel has appeared, although it is not yet known if she is a multiversal counterpart to Donna Troy or if she has a different origin altogether, although a comment from the character in ''Countdown to Adventure'' #4 implies she is at least partially both versions. She commented: \"I have survived all manner of crises and served Monitor and Anti-Monitor alike\". \n\nA year after the events of ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', Dark Angel appeared as the servant of [[Monitors (comics)|the 52 new Monitors]], each born from the creation of a new Multiverse. She tested [[Supergirl (Kara Zor-El)|Supergirl]] to see if she was indeed the proper persona to exist in the current [[DC Universe]].<ref>''Supergirl'' vol. 5 #15</ref><ref>''Supergirl'' vol. 5 #17</ref> After the test Dark Angel told Supergirl that it was her job to prod and provoke questionable entities or anomalies, in order to ensure their veracity in the world. Believing Supergirl to be out of place in the timestream Dark Angel was about to erase Supergirl's existence but was stopped by one of the 52 Monitors before she could do so and was reassigned to another unknown task. This task is later revealed to be the destruction of the entirety of Earth-48, the [[Forerunner (DC Comics)|Forerunner]] home planet.<ref>''Countdown to Adventure'' #1</ref><ref>''Countdown to Adventure'' #3-4</ref>\n\nShe later pursues Donna Troy, [[Kyle Rayner]] and [[Jason Todd]] through the Multiverse (possibly at the Monitors' behest), inquiring to the denizens of the Wildstorm Universe (Earth-50) as to whether her lookalike had passed through.<ref>''Countdown Presents: The Search for Ray Palmer - Wildstorm'' #1</ref> Dark Angel then appears in ''Countdown to Adventure'' #3, disguised as an [[Barbara Gordon|Oracle]] on Earth-33, turning the conjurers against Forerunner when she arrives. She then sheds her disguise and attacks Forerunner, killing the Earth-33 version of [[Starman (comics)|Starman]] before she is defeated. She escapes before Forerunner can finish her.\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nDark Angel is an incredibly powerful sorceress, able to cast various magic spells, transverse through space-time, and be nearly immortal.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of Wonder Woman enemies]]\n\n==References==\n*{{cite book|title=Wonder Woman: The Ultimate Guide To The Amazon Princess|last=Beatty|first=Scott|year=2009|publisher=Dorling Kindersley Publishing|isbn=978-0-7894-9616-4|pages=[https://archive.org/details/wonderwomanultim00beat/page/92 92\u201393]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/wonderwomanultim00beat/page/92}}\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://rapsheet.co.uk/RapSheetMain/Character.asp?UniqueId=770 Dark Angel Rapsheet]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20061126043705/http://www.titanstower.com/source/whoswho/darkangel.html Titans Tower Profile]\n*[https://dc.fandom.com/wiki/Dark_Angel Dark Angel] at DC Database\n\n{{Wonder Woman}}\n\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1998]] \n[[Category:DC Comics female supervillains]]\n[[Category:DC Comics characters who are shapeshifters]]\n[[Category:DC Comics characters who can teleport]] \n[[Category:DC Comics characters who have mental powers]]\n[[Category:DC Comics characters who use magic]]\n[[Category:DC Comics undead characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters who can change size]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters who can manipulate time]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters with spirit possession or body swapping abilities]] \n[[Category:Fictional characters with immortality]]\n[[Category:Fictional ghosts]]\n[[Category:Wonder Woman characters]]\n[[Category:Characters created by John Byrne (comics)]]"}]}}}}
