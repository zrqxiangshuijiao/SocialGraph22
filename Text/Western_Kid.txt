The character was the star of [[Western comics|Western]] feature published by Marvel's 1950s precursor, [[Atlas Comics (1950s)|Atlas Comics]].\n\n==Publication history==\nTex Dawson, the Western Kid, debuted in ''Western Kid'' #1 ([[cover-date]]d Nov. 1954), from publisher [[Atlas Comics (1950s)|Atlas Comics]], a predecessor of [[Marvel Comics]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Horn |first1=Maurice |title=Comics of the American West |date=1977 |publisher=Winchester Press |isbn=9780876911907 |page=97}}</ref> The character was created by an unknown writer and [[penciler]]-[[inker]] [[John Romita Sr.]], who the following decade would become one of [[Spider-Man]]'s signature artists. The feature, drawn exclusively by Romita, ran through issue #17 (Aug. 1957), with cover art by Romita, [[Joe Maneely]], [[John Severin]], and, for one cover each, [[Carl Burgos]], [[Russ Heath]], and [[Syd Shores]].<ref name=gcd>[http://www.comics.org/search.lasso?type=character&query=western+kid&sort=chrono&Submit=Search/ The Western Kid] (character) at the [[Grand Comics Database]]</ref>\n\nThe character resurfaced as the lead feature of the omnibus title ''[[Gunsmoke Western]]'' #51 (March 1959), in a story written by Atlas/Marvel editor-in-chief [[Stan Lee]] and drawn by [[Dick Ayers]].<ref name=gcd />\n\nWestern Kid reprints appeared in Marvel's 1970s omnibus series ''[[Western Gunfighters]]'' #3\u20136 and 17\u201333 (Dec.1970 \u2013 Sept. 1971, Sept. 1973 \u2013 Nov. 1975). In-between, the character starred in the reprint series ''The Western Kid'' vol. 2, #1\u20135 (Dec. 1971 \u2013 Aug. 1972) \u2014 the first issue of which sported a new cover by original artist Romita \u2014 and in ''[[Rawhide Kid]]'' #105 (Nov. 1972) and ''Gun-Slinger'' #1\u20133 (Jan.-June 1973), a series reflecting the character's temporary new name. The first issue, with a cover drawn by [[Jim Steranko]], was titled ''Tex Dawson, Gun-Slinger''.<ref name=gcd />\n\nThe character returned in ''[[Apache Skies]]'' (2002), a four-issue [[miniseries]] starring the [[Rawhide Kid]] and two persons called the Apache Kid: Dazii Aloysius Kare, and his wife, Rosa. This was a sequel to the miniseries ''[[Blaze of Glory (comics)|Blaze of Glory]]'' (2000), which specifically [[retconned]] that the naively clean-cut Marvel Western stories of years past were merely [[dime novel]] fictions of the characters' actual lives.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nTex Dawson, a.k.a. the Western Kid, was a clean-cut [[Old West]] [[gunfighter]] with a [[stallion]] named Whirlwind and a white [[German shepherd]] dog named Lightning. Unlike such fellow Atlas Western stars as [[Kid Colt]] and the [[Rawhide Kid]], he was not hunted by the law for a perceived crime, and unlike the [[Two-Gun Kid]] or the [[Outlaw Kid]], he wore no mask. Wandering the range as a do-gooder adventurer, the Western Kid was respected by [[sheriff]]s and [[marshal]]s, whom he often helped, and idolized by children.\n\n==Other versions==\nA modern-day version of the character stars in the five-issue ensemble [[miniseries]] ''Six Guns'' (#1\u20134 [[cover-date]]d Jan.-March 2012), by writer [[Andy Diggle]] and artist Davide Gianfelice, and also starring the extant female mercenary [[Tarantula (Marvel Comics)#Maria Vasquez|Tarantula]] and new contemporary versions of the Marvel [[Old West]] heroes the [[Black Rider (comics)|Black Rider]]; [[Matt Slade]]; and the [[Two-Gun Kid]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marvel.com/news/story/16788/six_guns_trigger_happy|title=Six Guns: Trigger Happy|date=October 6, 2011|first= Jim |last=Beard|publisher=Comic News (column), [[Marvel Comics|Marvel.com]] | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20111207115103/http://marvel.com/news/story/16788/six_guns_trigger_happy|archivedate= December 7, 2011 | url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://marvel.com/news/story/16160/six_guns_locked_and_loaded |title=Six Guns: Locked and Loaded| date=June 23, 2011|first= Jim |last=Beard|publisher=Comic News (column), [[Marvel Comics|Marvel.com]]| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110810022542/http://marvel.com/news/story/16160/six_guns_locked_and_loaded |archivedate= August 10, 2011 | url-status=live}}</ref><ref>[http://www.maelmill-insi.de/UHBMCC/smisc6.htm#S6259 \"''Six Guns'' (2012)\"] at The Unofficial Handbook of Marvel Comics Creators.
