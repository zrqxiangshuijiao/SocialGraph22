He was defeated and returned to his home planet by other aliens from Planet X.<ref name=paste /><ref>''Tales of Suspense'' #15</ref> His son [[Googam]] soon followed in his father's footsteps.<ref name=paste /><ref>''Tales of Suspense'' #17</ref>\n\n[[Xemnu]] later created a duplicate of Goom which was destroyed by the [[Hulk]].<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 Annual #5</ref>\n\nAt some point, Goom was captured by the alien [[Collector (comics)|Collector]] and imprisoned alongside other monsters. These captives were freed by the [[Mole Man]], but were defeated by the [[Beast (comics)|Beast]], [[Hank Pym|Giant-Man]], the Hulk and the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]], and [[Mister Fantastic]] exiled them into the [[Negative Zone]].{{issue|date=August 2013}}\n\nSomehow, Goom and other monsters returned to Earth and took up residence on [[Monster Isle]]. On a Valentine's Day, Goom attempted to find a human mate on Earth, but the goddess [[Venus (Marvel Comics)|Venus]] instead set him up (somewhat against his will) with the alien Shivoor.{{issue|date=August 2013}} Goom vanished afterwards, leaving his son Googam alone on Earth.{{issue|date=August 2013}}\n\nThe microscopic dictator [[List of monsters in Marvel Comics#Tim Boo Baa|Tim Boo Baa]] took advantage of Googam's search for his father to manipulate Googam into bringing him to Earth, where he was defeated by Googam's allies, the \"Fin Fang Four\".<ref>''Fin Fang Four'' #1</ref>\n\nGoom was later captured by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] and placed in the custody of their [[Nick Fury's Howling Commandos|Howling Commandos]] Monster Force.{{issue|date=August 2013}} Goom later appeared on [[Monster Isle]] when [[Kitty Pryde|Shadowcat]] and [[Magik (comics)|Magik]] appeared to look for a mutant girl named Bo. Goom was among the monsters that attacked the three until Magik teleported herself, Shadowcat, and Bo to the Jean Grey School for Higher Learning.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' vol. 3 #33</ref>\n\nDuring the ''[[Monsters Unleashed (comics)|Monsters Unleashed]]'' storyline, Goom was among the monsters seen falling from the sky near [[San Diego]]. It turned out that Goom and the other monsters that were dubbed \"Goliathons\" were summoned by the Inhuman kid Kei Kawade where they helped to fight the Leviathon Tide.<ref>''Monsters Unleashed'' vol. 2 #2</ref> In one of these battles, Goom mocked his son Googam for struggling in his battle against an [[Insectoid]] Leviathon.<ref>''Doctor Strange'' vol. 4 #1.MU</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nGoom has mental powers and an immense head. He had advanced technology which was seen in ''Tales of Suspense'' #15 including a spaceship, a disintegration-inducing \"Neutron Ray\", and a time machine, which had the ability to change the age of others.\n\n==In other media==\nGoom appears in \"The Hunted\", an episode of the animated television series ''[[Hulk and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H.]]'', where it is voiced by [[Dee Bradley Baker]]. The Goom seen in this episode is depicted as a female, does not demonstrate any mental powers, and is little more than a wild animal with the ability to breathe fire, ice, and acid. On Monster Isle, Hulk finds Goom's eggs, which hatch into baby Gooms that Hulk protects from [[Arkon]]. When Hulk and the hatchlings (voiced by [[Clancy Brown]], [[Benjamin Diskin]], and [[Eliza Dushku]]) are captured and placed in cages on Arkon's ship, it is revealed that Goom was previously captured by Arkon in his plot to raise the infant Gooms and use them to hunt Earth's heroes. Hulk and the Gooms crash Arkon's ship, and Arkon is chased away by Monster Isle's inhabitants. In the episode \"Planet Monster\" Pt. 2, Goom assists the Agents of S.M.A.S.H. and the Avengers in their fight against the [[Kree]].\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n===Further reading===\n* {{cite book|last=Cotter|first=Robert Michael \"Bobb\"|year=2008|title=The Great Monster Magazines: A Critical Study of the Black and White Publications of the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s|publisher=[[McFarland & Company]]|isbn=978-0786433896}}\n* {{cite book|last=Rhett Thomas|first=John|year=2015|title=The Marvel Legacy of Jack Kirby|publisher=[[Marvel Comics|Marvel]]|isbn=978-0785197935}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://marvel.wikia.com/wiki/Goom_%28Earth-616%29 Goom] at Marvel Wiki\n* {{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/goomtos.htm|Goom}}\n\n{{Stan Lee}}\n{{Jack Kirby}}\n\n[[Category:Characters created by Dick Ayers]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Jack Kirby]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Stan Lee]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1961]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics aliens]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters who have mental powers]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics male characters]]"}]}}}}
