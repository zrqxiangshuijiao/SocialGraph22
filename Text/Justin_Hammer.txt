The character is depicted as a villainous entrepreneur, head of [[Hammer Industries]] and a frequent adversary of the [[superhero]] [[Iron Man]]. As he explains in his first major appearance, he is the reason why many of Iron Man's supervillain enemies have access to extremely advanced technology and why these foes use their equipment for violent crimes instead of profiting by bringing the designs to market. Hammer reveals that the villains are his underworld mercenaries, secretly armed and contractually obliged to fulfill missions against Hammer's competitors and enemies, such as Tony Stark.\n\n[[Sam Rockwell]] portrayed the character in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] film ''[[Iron Man 2]]'' (2010),<ref name=\"Rappe\">{{cite news|last=Rappe|first=Elisabeth|title=Sam Rockwell Confirms Himself For 'Iron Man 2'|url=http://www.cinematical.com/2009/01/16/sam-rockwell-confirms-himself-for-iron-man-2/|access-date=April 20, 2013|newspaper=Cinematical|date=January 16, 2009}}</ref> and the [[short film]] ''[[All Hail the King]]''.\n\n==Publication history==\n{{Expand section|date=December 2012}}\nJustin Hammer first appeared in ''[[Iron Man (comic book)|Iron Man]]'' #120 (March 1979), and was created by [[David Michelinie]], [[John Romita Jr.]], and [[Bob Layton]].<ref>{{cite book|last1 = Sanderson|first1 = Peter|author-link = Peter Sanderson|last2= Gilbert|first2= Laura, ed.|chapter= 1970s|title = Marvel Chronicle A Year by Year History|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|year = 2008|page = 189|isbn =978-0756641238|quote= Tony Stark's billionaire nemesis Justin Hammer made his first appearance in ''The Invincible Iron Man'' #120 by writer David Michelinie and artist John Romita, Jr. and Bob Layton.}}</ref><ref name=\"TheWashingtonPost\">{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/comic-riffs/wp/2016/02/22/frank-miller-on-his-dark-knight-returns-30-years-later-i-was-rooting-for-batman-all-the-way/?noredirect=on | location=[[Washington, D.C.]] | newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] | title=Frank Miller on his 'Dark Knight Returns' 30 years later: 'I was rooting for Batman all the way' | first=David | last=Betancourt | date=February 22, 2016}}</ref> Layton himself recalled in a 2014 interview that he and Michelinie originally created Hammer as the cautionary tale of what kind of person [[Tony Stark]] might have become if he stayed on his path as a global war profiteer, as well as a tribute to actor [[Peter Cushing]]; in Layton's words, Stark and Hammer are essentially in the same line of work, but with diametrically opposed moral views.<ref name=\"DolmenMagazine\">{{cite news| url=https://www.boblayton.com/interview-with-bob-by-dolmen-magazine/ | work=Dolmen Magazine | title=Interview with Bob by Dolmen Magazine | first=Vicente | last=Garc\u00eda | date=April 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nJustin Hammer was born in [[Surrey]], England and later became a citizen of Monaco.

In the event that a mercenary under his employ violated his contract, Hammer would send an enforcement unit (usually led by his most reliable supervillain employee [[Whiplash (comics)|Blacklash]]) to attack the rogue and confiscate his assigned equipment.\n\nAt the start of the ''[[Demon in a Bottle]]'' storyline, Hammer invented a device called the Hypersonic Scan Transmitter which allowed him to take control of Iron Man's armor. He tested this remote control affecting Iron Man's unibeam, sealing plates, and boot jets.<ref>''Iron Man'' #118, 120, 123</ref> Angered that he had lost a lucrative bid to Stark International,  he took control of Iron Man's armor and forced him to kill the Carnelian ambassador, and set an army of superhuman criminals (consisting of [[Abner Jenkins|Beetle]] I, [[Constrictor (comics)|Constrictor]], [[Discus (comics)|Discus]], [[Leap-Frog (comics)|Leap-Frog]], [[Man-Killer]], [[Porcupine (comics)|Porcupine]] I, [[Stiletto (comics)|Stiletto]], and [[Aqueduct (comics)|Water Wizard]]) against Iron Man.

He infected Stark's bloodstream with mood-altering nanites that made Stark irrational and temperamental. In a final confrontation with Iron Man on Hammer's own space station, Hammer was accidentally frozen in a block of ice when the water he fell into leaked out into space and instantly froze and is currently lost in space.
