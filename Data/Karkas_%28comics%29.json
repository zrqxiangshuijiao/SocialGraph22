He was made a slave, pitted in gladiatorial contests against others considered grotesque. Another gladiator was [[Ransak the Reject]], who was considered hideous by the Deviants due to his normal human appearance (also interpretable as because he looked too much like an [[Eternals (comics)|Eternal]]). Karkas and the Reject were pitted against each other, in a bout viewed by the Eternal [[Thena]], in which Ransak bested Karkas. When [[Eson the Searcher|Eson]] the Celestial attacked, Karkas begged Thena for sanctuary with the Deviants' enemies, the Eternals.<ref>''The Eternals'' #8</ref> Thena teleported both Karkas and Ransak away to [[Olympia (comics)|Olympia]].<ref>''The Eternals'' #11-12</ref> With Thena and Ransak, Karkas battled Zakka and [[Tutinax]].<ref>''The Eternals'' Annual #1</ref> Since then the two have become friends and reside primarily with the Eternals.
