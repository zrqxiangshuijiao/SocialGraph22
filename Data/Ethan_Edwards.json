He is a [[pastiche]] of the [[DC Comics]] character [[Superman]].\n\n==Publication history==\nEthan Edwards first appeared in ''[[Marvel Knights Spider-Man]]'' #13 and was created by [[Reginald Hudlin]] and [[Billy Tan]].\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nEthan is a [[Skrull]], whose father created the [[Super-Skrull]], and was sent to Earth to conquer it in the aftermath of the Skrull homeworld's destruction at the hands of [[Galactus]]. On the night of his arrival, Ethan's Earth parents-to-be were driving home to their [[Iowa]] farm when a large metal object seemingly from space crashed with him inside. The couple decided that a [[miracle]] had occurred, that they were judged to be worthy and a child was given to them as a gift from [[God]]. The Edwards's gave him a strong [[moral]] background, taught him the [[Value theory|value]] of hard work and [[humility]]. Years later, Ethan told them he wanted to leave the farm and go to the city. As he prepared to leave, Mr. Edwards gave him a piece of advice he would never forget: that \"[[with great power comes great responsibility|with great power, there must also come great responsibility]]\". Arriving in [[New York City]], Ethan began work as the new star reporter at ''[[The Daily Bugle]]''. He also began fighting crime as a costumed [[superhero]], calling himself '''Moral Man''', which soon brought him into contact with fellow Bugle employee and [[New York City]] superhero, [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]], the Amazing [[Spider-Man]], when the two heroes independently attempted to confront the [[Absorbing Man]], currently carrying out a series of hits on the orders of the [[Owl (comics)|Owl]].<ref>''Marvel Knights Spider-Man'' #13'' (2011). Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nRecognizing that he needs assistance in learning how to be a hero, Ethan approaches Peter for aid, with Peter reluctantly agreeing to take Ethan on as an 'apprentice'. To learn more about Ethan's powers, Spider-Man takes him to the [[Baxter Building]], where [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]] of the [[Fantastic Four]] performs tests on Ethan to uncover the origin of his powers. Reed discovers Ethan is as fast as the [[Human Torch]], can see [[Invisible Woman|Sue]] when she's invisible, lift as much weight as [[Thing (comics)|Ben]] and heal injuries.<ref>''Marvel Knights Spider-Man'' #16'' (2011). Marvel Comics.</ref> However, when confronting the Fantastic Four later, Ben is able to knock Ethan unconscious with a single blow to the head, suggesting that he may not be in the Thing's weight class in terms of raw strength.<ref>''Marvel Knights Spider-Man'' #17 (2011). Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nAfter a fight, the press show up and Moral Man takes off to protect his identity, but the press got a full facial photograph of Ethan as Moral Man. On the roof, Peter Parker tells Ethan they have got a picture of him, but he says it's okay because his glasses will hide his identity. They go inside and, as the two of them step out of the elevator, the press surrounds Ethan and want to talk to him. Reed calls Peter to explain that Ethan is a Skrull, whose father created the Super-Skrull, and that Ethan was sent to Earth to conquer it in the aftermath of the Skrull homeworld's destruction at the hands of Galactus.<ref>''Marvel Knights Spider-Man'' #16 (2011). Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nJonah calls Ethan into his office and tells him he will let things go if he gives the paper the exclusive story on Moral Man. Ethan refuses and flies through the window. Peter goes after him but Ethan takes off again for Iowa, leaving Pete to wonder how he's going to get there. The Fantastic Four are examining the ship Ethan arrived in when a bright yellow light comes out of it. It shines on Ethan, who begins speaking another language until the Thing smashes it into the atmosphere. When Ethan re-awakens, he lashes out at the FF, then begins to have some sort of nervous breakdown before flying off, donning a new leather costume and brutally attacking the Absorbing Man.<ref>''Marvel Knights Spider-Man'' #18 (2011). Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nBack at the Daily Bugle, Ethan Edwards researches who and what the Skrull are, coming to think he is a \"murderous Skrull\". Confused and angry, he searches the Baxter Building for Reed Richards, but the man is not home. When Spider-Man and the [[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]] arrive (Spider-Man having defeated the Absorbing Man thanks to a trap set up by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] when the Owl tried to escape his now-rogue 'employee'), a fight starts, but \"a little old lady\" ([[Aunt May]]) tells Ethan he's not a monster but a good man. Spider-Man tells Ethan he has something no one does, \"healing power\", and a lot of people out there need healing. Following this advice Ethan moved overseas to help the less fortunate. Later, Reed Richards revealed that the starship did not give Ethan his ability to heal others, leaving Spider-Man to wonder where it actually came from.<ref>''Marvel Knights Spider-Man'' #18 (2011). Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nEthan later joined [[Wonder Man]]'s team of [[Revengers]] under the name '''Virtue'''. He participated in the attack on the New Avengers.<ref>''New Avengers Annual'' #1 (2011)</ref> He and the rest of the Revengers were defeated by all three Avengers teams. Ethan claimed that he joined the team to avenge his peoples' defeat during the \"[[Secret Invasion]].\"<ref>''Avengers Annual'' vol.5 #1 (2011). Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nEthan Edwards' Skrull physiology allows him to shapeshift into virtually any form that he chooses. He also has superhuman strength, healing powers, energy projection, flight and the ability to see every frequency in the light spectrum, allowing him to see Sue Storm when she's invisible. He's also invulnerable, allowing him to withstand physical injuries. However, when battling the Thing, he was knocked unconscious.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Ethan_Edwards_(Earth-616) Ethan Edwards] at Marvel Wiki\n* [http://www.spiderfan.org/characters/ethan_edwards.html Ethan Edwards] at Spiderfan.org\n* [https://comicvine.gamespot.com/ethan-edwards/29-1776/ Ethan Edwards] at Comicvine\n* {{gcdb|type=character|search=Ethan+Edwards|title=Ethan Edwards}}\n* {{comicbookdb|type=character|id=8604|title=Ethan Edwards}}\n\n{{Skrull}}\n{{Spider-Man characters}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Edwards, Ethan}}\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 2005]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters with healing abilities]]\n[[Category:Fictional reporters]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters with superhuman strength]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters who are shapeshifters]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics extraterrestrial superheroes]]\n[[Category:Skrull]]\n[[Category:Spider-Man characters]]"}]}}}}
