When he awoke, he met the [[Human Torch]] and [[Wyatt Wingfoot]] and witnessed the seeming destruction of the Evil Eye.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #54</ref> Prester John later became temporarily possessed by an alien power-stone and battled the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] and [[Iron Man]].<ref>''Marvel Two-in-One'' #12</ref>\n\nPrester John later time-traveled by unknown means back to the 12th century.

He then remained in the 12th century.<ref>''Defenders'' #11</ref> It was later revealed how he was thrown back to the 12th century by [[Kang the Conqueror|Kang]].

He is an excellent swordsman and is proficient with most known weapons of 12th century Europe and Asia. He has many years of experience as a priest, a king, a warrior, and an explorer. He wears a special suit of medieval body armor. He is usually armed with a sword and a staff.\n\nPrester John has sometimes carried the [[Evil Eye of Avalon|Evil Eye]], a magical power object able to project bolts of concussive force, to disintegrate matter, and to create and destroy force fields. He has also used the Chair of Survival, a device that places Prester John in suspended animation. Prester John once briefly possessed superhuman strength and durability conferred upon him while he was possessed by an alien power-stone, the Stone of Power. Once freed from its influence, his abilities returned to normal.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/presterjohn.htm|Prester John}}\n*[http://www.marvel.com/universe/Prester_John The Wanderer] - Marvel Universe Wiki\n\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1966]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters with superhuman strength]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]"}]}}}}
