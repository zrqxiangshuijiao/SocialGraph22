The prism itself bonds to the Wasp in an attempt to save itself, but is eventually removed by Billy Roberts after he is located by the Avengers. Roberts becomes Doctor Spectrum once more, although on this occasion the Power Prism is in control and seeks to bond with the most powerful Avenger, the Thunder God [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]. The Power Prism succeeds in taking Thor as a host, infecting [[Mjolnir (comics)|Mjolnir]] to use as a focal point to control him and defeat the other Avengers, but fails to take into account that to wield Mjolnir, Thor must be \"worthy\". No longer worthy to wield the hammer due to him being tainted by the gem, Thor drops Mjolnir and reverts to his mortal alter-ego Donald Blake during a fight with Iron Man, which results in the Power Prism losing control and becoming inert, apparently forever.<ref>''The Avengers'' Annual #8 (1978)</ref>\n\nThe Grandmaster later reforms the Squadron Sinister, bringing in Henry Pym's former lab assistant Alice Nugent to be the new Doctor Spectrum.

Krimonn was originally a [[Skrull]] who, after failing to usurp the Skrull [[Emperor]], was transformed into a living prism as punishment.<ref name=\"autogenerated1973\"/> When the Grandmaster requires champions to battle the Avengers, he retrieves the prism and grants Krimonn several energy-based powers that can be used in conjunction with a host.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} Kenji Obatu is the first to coin the term \"Power Prism\", and discovers that although trapped in prism form, Krimonn remains aggressive and asserts his will via [[telepathy]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} Krimonn's mind is \"muted\" by Nebulon when the Power Prism is given to Billy Roberts, although Krimonn reasserts itself during the quest to find and bond with the character Thor.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} When the plan fails and the gem is shattered, Krimonn's consciousness apparently dissipated forever.\n\nKrimonn could bestow on a host the ability to project and manipulate light energy in various colors;{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} create light energy constructs of various shapes, sizes and colors;{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} flight; protection from the rigors of space and the ability to become intangible.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} The Power Prism is vulnerable to ultra-violet light.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\nThe Earth-712 Doctor Spectrum gains his power the Skrullian Power Prism given to him by the Skrullian Skymaster.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} When the Power Prism later exploded and fragments of it were embedded in Doctor Spectrum, his skin, hair, and costume were bleached chalk-white.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} The Earth-712 Power Prism possesses the same abilities as the Earth-616 version.\n\nThe Earth-31916 Power Prism is a sentient power source removed from the spacecraft that brings Hyperion to Earth.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\n==Other versions==\n===Secret Wars (2015)===\nAn alternate version of the original Doctor Spectrum later appears on [[Battleworld]].

In the episode \"Dark Avengers\", Spectrum uses the [[Infinity Gems#Description|Reality Stone]] as part of [[Nighthawk (Marvel Comics)|Nighthawk]]'s plan to invert history so that the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] are supervillains and the Squadron are heroes, but the Avengers eventually restore reality. In \"Spectrums\", [[Ant-Man (Scott Lang)|Ant-Man]] reveals he sold a inhibitor device for the Power Prism to Spectrum, and brings [[Captain America]], [[Iron Man]], and [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] to help him stop the villain. In their ensuing fight, the inhibitor is destroyed, so Spectrum harvests the Avengers' feelings to create spectral copies of [[Loki (Marvel Comics)|Loki]], the [[Bucky Barnes|Winter Soldier]] and [[Ultron]] to fight the heroes. Once they overcome their respective nemeses, the Avengers discover Nighthawk and [[Hyperion (comics)|Hyperion]] had Spectrum use the Power Prism in order to destroy the Squadron's home planet against his will and that the prism was a living entity in control of its host, and the \"true Doctor Spectrum\". Ant-Man and the [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]] free Spectrum, who reverts to Roberts. In the aftermath, Roberts joins a [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] space program so he can find a suitable new planet to reside on while the Power Prism forms its own body, assumes the Doctor Spectrum mantle, and reunites with Nighthawk. In \"Avengers' Last Stand\", the Power Prism joins the Squadron in enacting Nighthawk's plot against the Avengers. In \"Avengers Underground\", the Power Prism is defeated by Ant-Man and used by Captain America to convert the Sun's effects, and render Hyperion powerless. Captain  America later uses the remains of the Prism's energy to bring the Avengers to one location before it becomes inert.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://marvel.wikia.com/wiki/Doctor_Spectrum_%28Earth-712%29 Joseph Ledger (Earth-712)]\u2014Marvel Database\n* [http://marvel.com/universe/Doctor_Spectrum_%28Earth-712%29 Doctor Spectrum (Earth-712)]\u2014Marvel Universe: The definitive online source for Marvel super hero bios.]\n* [http://worldsofjms.com/supreme/index.htm#spectrum Worlds of JMS link to the '''Doctor Spectrum: Full Spectrum''' page]\n\n{{Squadron Supreme}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Spectrum, Doctor}}\n[[Category:Articles about multiple fictional characters]]\n[[Category:Characters created by John Buscema]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Roy Thomas]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1969]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1971]]\n[[Category:Fictional soldiers]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics superheroes]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics titles]]\n[[Category:Squadron Supreme]]"}]}}}}
