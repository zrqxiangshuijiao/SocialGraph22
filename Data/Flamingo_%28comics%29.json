[[Jason Todd]] (the second [[Robin (comics)|Robin]], who had become [[Red Hood]]) has rallied a defense against Flamingo, but sustains bullet wounds to the face and knee-cap. Flamingo then turns his attentions to Red Hood's partner Scarlet. Flamingo then tugs at the seams of Scarlet's mask before she gashes him with one of her blades. Feeling responsible for the girl and her condition, [[Damian Wayne|Robin]] jumps into the fray to help, but receives four bullets to his cape-protected spine, paralyzing him from the waist down. [[Dick Grayson]] (who is operating as [[Batman]]) delivers a boot to Flamingo's face. When Dick is nearly tossed over the side of the building, Jason uses a construction digger to scoop Flamingo up and deposit him over the edge, sending him plummeting to the Earth below. [[James Gordon (comics)|Commissioner James Gordon]] later tells Batman that Flamingo's body was never found.<ref>''Batman and Robin'' #6.
