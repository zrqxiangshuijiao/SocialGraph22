Like many magician superheroes introduced in the [[Golden Age of Comics]], Ibis owes much to the popular comic strip character [[Mandrake the Magician]]. A second Ibis, successor of the first, was introduced in 2007.\n\n==Publication history==\nThe original Ibis first appeared in ''[[Whiz Comics]]'' #2 (February 1940), and was created by Bob Kingett.<ref name=Benton>{{cite book |last1=Benton |first1=Mike |title=Superhero Comics of the Golden Age: The Illustrated History |date=1992 |publisher=Taylor Publishing Company |location=Dallas |isbn=0-87833-808-X |pages=112\u2013113 |url=https://archive.org/details/superherocomicso0000bent/page/112 |access-date=15 January 2020}}</ref> When superheroes declined in popularity in the early 1950s, Ibis and the other Fawcett characters ceased publication. One Ibis story shortly thereafter was reprinted by [[Charlton Comics]].<ref>''Danger and Adventure'' #22 (February 1955) as noted in [http://www.toonopedia.com/ibis.htm Don Markstein's Toonopedia]</ref>\nThe Fawcett characters were later licensed and eventually bought outright by [[DC Comics]] in the 1970s. \nThe second Ibis first appeared in ''[[Doctor Fate|Helmet of Fate: Ibis the Invincible]]'' #1 (January 2007), and was created by [[Tad Williams]] and [[Phil Winslade]].\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n===Prince Amentep===\nIbis begins his life as '''Amentep''', a prince of [[ancient Egypt]] who was in love with the beautiful Princess Taia of [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]]. As a young man, Amentep is given the \"Ibistick\", a [[Amulet|talisman]] of incredible power, by the Egyptian god [[Thoth]], who empowers the talisman after Ibis was overthrown.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Mitchell |first1=Kurt |last2=Thomas |first2=Roy |title=American Comic Book Chronicles: 1940-1944 |date=2019 |publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing |isbn=978-1605490892 |page=54}}</ref> Amentep's throne is eventually usurped \u2013 with the aid of a demonic army conjured up by the evil god [[Set (mythology)|Set]] \u2013 by a cruel magician known as the Black Pharaoh. When Taia, who is under the protection of [[Osiris]], refuses to marry him, the Black Pharaoh shoots her with a poisoned arrow. Using his Ibistick, Amentep places his beloved in suspended animation to allow her to heal. He casts a similar spell upon himself, hoping to be present when Taia revives.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Steranko |first1=Jim |title=The Steranko History of Comics, vol 2 |date=1972 |publisher=Supergraphics |page=41}}</ref>\n\n4000 years later, the mummy of Amentep returns to life in an [[United States|American]] [[museum]] in 1940 (this was later revealed to be the work of the wizard [[Shazam (wizard)|Shazam]]). Now called \"Ibis\", Amentep sets out in search of his beloved, eventually finding her at another museum.<ref>{{Cite comic | writer = | artist = | story = | title = Whiz Comics | volume = 1 | issue = #2 | date = March 1940 | publisher = [[Fawcett Comics]] | pages = 14-20 | panel = | id =}}</ref> Seeking to adjust to this new world, Ibis uses his vast powers to become a crimefighter.\n\nIbis can do almost anything with the power of the Ibistick: build force-fields around cities, transport himself and others, heal or destroy people, bring people back to life or summon spirits, give superhuman powers, and even make objects appear out of thin air. Without the wand however, he is powerless, and this weakness is frequently exploited by his enemies. The Ibistick apparently vibrates in the presence of evil, at one point it even wakes him up. Taia was once shown using the wand to make lightning strike a foe of Ibis, and often uses it at other times. It can be used by anybody, but not to cause harm directly to Ibis, or it will backfire on the user. It cannot be used directly against certain magics.\n\nAccording to ''Jess Nevins' Encyclopedia of Golden Age Superheroes'', \"Ibis fights ordinary criminals, an animated and living Sphinx, the [[Yellow Peril]] Trug, a spider made man-sized and man-smart by the Ibistick, the superintelligent maimed madman Half-Man, the Dark Spirit (a forgotten god of wickedness), Ruthven the Warlock, and Lucifer himself\".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Nevins |first1=Jess |title=Encyclopedia of Golden Age Superheroes |date=2013 |publisher=High Rock Press |isbn=978-1-61318-023-5 |page=133}}</ref>\n\nIbis and Taia next appear in a [[Justice League]]/[[Justice Society]] crossovers as members of a team referred to as Shazam's Squadron of Justice. These heroes live in a parallel universe on a world called Earth-S. Along with many other Earth-S characters, they were imprisoned in Doctor Sivana's Suspendium globe, but released twenty years later when it drifted near the Sun. Ibis was a member of the Squadron of Justice, organized to defeat King Kull when he paralyzed the Marvels and tried to destroy all three Earths. Ibis helped stop Mr. Atom from destroying the futuristic City of Tomorrow on Earth-One.\n\nAfter the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', Ibis and Taia were [[retconned]] as part of the Golden Age of the [[DC Universe]], in which Ibis served alongside other wartime heroes in the [[All-Star Squadron]]. As noted in ''Starman'' Vol. 2, #40 (March 1998), Ibis tends to operate out of [[Fawcett City]] like other heroes, including [[Bulletman]], Minute Man, [[Spy Smasher]] and the duo of Mr. Scarlet and Pinky.\n\nIbis was reintroduced in the modern [[DC Universe]] in ''The Power of Shazam!'' #11, in which he is resurrected by [[Mary Marvel]] and [[Uncle Marvel|\"Uncle\" Dudley]] to rescue the wizard [[Shazam (wizard)|Shazam]] from [[Hell (DC Comics)|Hell]], where he had been imprisoned by the demoness [[Blaze and Satanus|Blaze]]. In ''[[Zatanna]]'' #1, part of the ''[[Seven Soldiers]]'' miniseries, Ibis and Taia presumably perish along with [[Doctor Thirteen]] and Timothy Ravenwind at the hands of Gwydion during a seance conducted by Zatanna. The sorceress blames her own shortcomings for their deaths.<ref>''Seven Soldiers: Zatanna'' #1 (2005)</ref>\n\nIbis had a cameo in ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', in a scene showing the return of the Fawcett superheroes to Earth-S. A modernized version of Ibis appeared in ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'' #10 as the [[Egypt]]ian representative in [[Black Adam]]'s coalition. It is not known if this Ibis is the same character.\n\n===Danny Khalifa===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Ibisdcu0.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Danny Khalifa as Ibis, art by [[Phil Winslade]].]] -->\nAmentep's successor is an [[Egyptian American]] boy named Danny Khalifa. Due to his ancient bloodline, Danny is chosen by Amentep to be his successor. He inherits the Ibistick and is thrust into a conflict between ancient Egyptian gods. As Ibis, Danny prevents the helmet of [[Doctor Fate]] from falling into the hands of the dark god [[Set (mythology)|Set]]. Danny is assisted by the deity Thoth, who becomes his mentor and frightens away the bullies.<ref>''The Helmet of Fate: Ibis the Invincible'' #1 (Jan 2007)</ref>\n\n===''Reign in Hell''===\nIbis returns to seek his new apprentice's services during the ''[[Reign in Hell]]'' miniseries. Tensions between the major demons and the Hell-empowered heroes and villains erupt into a struggle for the control of the [[Hell (DC Comics)|Hell]] dimension. Danny accepts the summons. He is assisted by [[Black Alice (comics)|Black Alice]], who offers guidance and covers for his absence on Earth. While in Hell, Black Alice betrays him to ensure her own safety, abandoning him to [[Neron (DC Comics)|Neron]]'s forces.\nHe is later seen alive on Earth fighting against [[Frankenstein (DC Comics)|Frankenstein]] after being corrupted by the energy of the Starheart.<ref>''Justice League of America'' (vol. 2) #47 (September 2010)</ref>\n\n==Golden Age appearances==\nIbis the Invincible appeared in:<ref name=Benton/>\n* ''[[Whiz Comics]]'' #2-155 (Feb 1940 - June 1953)\n* ''Ibis, the Invincible'' #1-6 (Jan 1942 - Sept 1948)\n* ''American's Greatest'' #4 (Summer 1942)\n* ''All Hero'' #1 (Mar 1945)\n\n==Other media appearances==\n* In the pilot episode of the 2014 television series ''[[Constantine (TV series)|Constantine]]'', the Ibistick is visible when a character picks up the Helmet of Fate.\n* In the film ''[[Shazam!
