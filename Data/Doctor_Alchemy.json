Desmond has two distinct personalities: one major driving personality and another criminally inclined one.<ref>{{cite book |last =Rovin |first =Jeff |title =The Encyclopedia of Supervillains |publisher =Facts on File |date =1987 |location =New York |isbn = 0-8160-1356-X |page=84}}</ref> Under his darker personality, he applies his knowledge of chemistry to create the identity of Mister Element. He creates elemental weapons such as bulletproof silicon to shield his cars, and discovers a new element, Elemento, a magnetic light with which he sent the [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Flash]] into space.<ref name=\"dc-ency2\" />{{rp|92}}\n\nAfter being sent to jail as a result of his first encounter with the Flash, he learns of the [[Philosopher's stone|Philosopher's Stone]] from his cellmate. He escapes jail, finds the Philosopher's Stone, and uses its power to transmute elements to restart his criminal career under a new identity - Doctor Alchemy. Eventually his good personality resurfaces, causing him to quit crime and hide the Philosopher's Stone. Shortly after, a new Doctor Alchemy appears and is revealed to be his astral twin '''\"Alvin\" Desmond''', with whom he shares a psychic link. It was later revealed that \"Alvin\" was a construct of the Stone created by Albert's criminal personality. When Albert confronts and defeats \"Alvin\", he resumes the identity of Doctor Alchemy.<ref name=\"Who 19852\">''Who's Who in the DC Universe'' #6 (Aug. 1985)</ref> While he was incarcerated, both of his costumed identities were used by others: Curtis Engstrom using the Philosopher's Stone as the Alchemist and Alexander Petrov using the Mister Element identity.<ref name=\"dc-ency2\" />{{rp|92}}\n\n===Curtis Engstrom===\n'''Dr. Curtis Engstrom''' is an advisor on the project when [[S.T.A.R. Labs]] acquired the Philosopher's Stone with intentions of using one of its fragments in their microscopic medical computer.<ref>''The Flash'' (vol. 2) #71 (Feb. 1992)</ref> He stole the computer with the help of a small-time crook, Moe \"Mouthpiece\" Miglian, but he was later arrested. After escaping from prison, Engstrom donned his own Dr. Alchemy costume and set out to retrieve the microchip that had been taken from him by Miglian, calling himself the '''Alchemist'''. After being defeated, Engstrom and Miglian were both sent to prison.\n\n===Alexander Petrov===\n'''Alexander Petrov''' is a [[criminologist]] working for the [[Keystone City]] Police Department. But in order to advance his career, he uses one of Albert Desmond's weapons used as Mister Element to freeze the lab supervisor solid. Petrov is promoted to replace the dead supervisor and discovers he likes the thrill of killing. He continues to eliminate members of the department he sees as \"threats\" to his position, using the weapon and ice-based effects. He uses the effects and his position as head of the crime lab to shift suspicion to [[Captain Cold]]. His plan comes undone when profiler [[Ashley Zolomon]] enters his office as he is putting on his mask. The [[Wally West|Flash]] is able to stop him from killing Zolomon, but Captain Cold interrupts them before the Flash can take him into custody. Captain Cold kills Petrov for breaking one of the rules of the [[Rogues (comics)|Rogues]]' code of \"ethics\" - never frame another Rogue for your own crimes.<ref>{{cite comic\n| writer = Geoff Johns\n| penciller = [[Alberto Dose]]\n| copencillers = [[Howard Porter (artist)|Howard Porter]]<!-- parts of issues 205 and 206 -->\n| story = Ignition (parts 2 through 6)\n| title = The Flash\n| volume = 2\n| issue = 202-206\n| date = November 2002 \u2013 March 2003\n}}</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nAs Mister Element, Desmond dons a suit equipped with an [[Oxygen mask|oxygen mask]] and selects the model of [[carbon]] as his suit emblem.\n \nDoctor Alchemy possesses the Philosopher's Stone which once belonged to [[Merlin (DC Comics)|Merlin]].
