While working as a chemist and research scientist for Mainstream Motors, he created an \"alchemy gun\" capable of transmuting matter from one form to another by an unknown process (wood to glass, etc.). Horace Claymore, the company's president, was impressed until Curtis voiced his intent to keep the device. Claymore argued that since the gun was made on company time, it belonged to Mainstream. When Claymore fired him, Curtis adopted the persona of Chemistro to gain revenge and to extort his former employers.\n\nIn combat with [[Luke Cage]], Chemistro accidentally fired his alchemy gun at his own right foot, turning it to steel, though the unstable nature of the transmutation soon caused it to crumble to dust, leaving him crippled.<ref>''[[Luke Cage|Luke Cage: Hero for Hire]]'' #12</ref> Carr was turned over to the police, and in prison was beaten by his cellmate Arch Morton into revealing the means by which the alchemy gun worked. Morton took on the Chemistro persona, and Carr invented a \"nullifier\" device which enabled Cage to defeat Morton.<ref name=\"Power Man #37-39\">''Power Man'' #37-39</ref>\n\nCurtis's alchemy gun was later stolen by his younger brother Calvin, who became the third Chemistro. Curtis aided Cage and [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]] in defeating Calvin.<ref>''Power Man and Iron Fist'' #94, 96</ref>\n\nLater, Curtis came to work at a division of Stark Enterprises as a research scientist and Director of Research and Development at Stark Prosthetics in Denver, Colorado. He created an artificial prosthesis to replace his missing foot. Stark Prosthetics ended up attacked by the [[Wrecker (comics)|Wrecker]] during the \"[[Acts of Vengeance]]\" when the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]] sent him to attack [[Iron Man]]. Curtis aided Iron Man and [[War Machine|Jim Rhodes]] against the Wrecker and Calvin, although Calvin destroyed Curtis' left foot. After that attack, Curtis made another prostheses for his other foot.<ref name=\"Iron Man #251-252\">''Iron Man'' #251-252</ref>\n\n===Archibald Morton===\n{{Infobox comics character| <!--Wikipedia:WikiProject Comics--> \nimage=\n|caption=\n|character_name=Chemistro II \n|real_name=Archibald Morton\n|species=\n|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]\n|debut=''[[Luke Cage|Power Man]]'' #37 (Nov. 1976)\n|creators=[[Marv Wolfman]] (writer)<br>[[Ron Wilson (comics)|Ron Wilson]] (artist)\n|alliances=\n|aliases=\n|powers=Ability to transmute substances through contact with his left hand\n|}}\nArchibald \"Arch\" Morton was born in [[Sheridan, Wyoming]], and became a professional criminal and was sent to prison. He forced Curtis Carr to reveal the secret of his alchemy gun while they were cellmates. Upon leaving prison, Morton attempted to replicate the alchemy gun, but it exploded in his hand, granting him superhuman powers and enabling him to transmute substances via touch. He battled Luke Cage on behalf of the Baron. Morton was ultimately apprehended, thanks in large part to the help of the original Chemistro.<ref name=\"Power Man #37-39\"/>\n\n===Calvin Carr===\n{{Infobox comics character| <!--Wikipedia:WikiProject Comics--> \nimage=\n|caption=\n|character_name=Chemistro III\n|real_name=Calvin Carr\n|species=\n|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]\n|debut=''[[Power Man and Iron Fist]]'' #93 (June 1983)\n|creators=[[Kurt Busiek]] (writer)<br>[[Ernie Chan]] (artist)\n|alliances=Mandarin's Minions<br>Flashmob \n|aliases=\n|powers=Wields alchemy wrist-blasters \n|}}\nCurtis' younger brother Calvin Carr stole the alchemy gun and took the Chemistro name. He embarked on a criminal career and battled Luke Cage and Iron Fist. Curtis intervened, and helped the heroes foil his brother's plans.<ref>''Power Man and Iron Fist'' #93-96</ref>\n\nCalvin's alchemy gun was turned into wrist blasters by the [[Wizard (Marvel Comics)|Wizard]] who sent him and the [[Wrecker (comics)|Wrecker]] to attack [[Iron Man]] and [[War Machine|Jim Rhodes]] during the \"[[Acts of Vengeance]]\". Curtis helped the heroes, and Calvin destroyed Curtis' other foot, but gave up when he was defeated by Iron Man.<ref name=\"Iron Man #251-252\"/>\n\nCalvin has been hired by the [[Hood (comics)|Hood]] to take advantage of the split in the superhero community caused by the Superhuman Registration Act.<ref>''The New Avengers'' #35</ref>\n\nChemistro informs The Hood of a plot by [[Owl (Marvel Comics)|Owl]] to sell [[Deathlok]], which he stole from S.H.I.E.L.D., to the highest bidder. As Owl hasn't gained permission from his new crime syndicate, The Hood decides to gatecrash the auction. Sending [[Madame Masque]], the [[Crimson Cowl (Justine Hammer)|Crimson Cowl]], the [[Wizard (Marvel Comics)|Wizard]], and [[Jonas Harrow|Dr. Jonas Harrow]] as proxies he effortlessly ambushes and dispatches the [[Owl (comics)|Owl]].\n\nJohn King and The Hood reconvene in the back room of run-down bar where they are confronted by a curious [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] who overhears their plans to run Deathlok through the lobby of Avengers Tower. They escape by shooting Wolverine and assuming the form the Nistanti who originally owned his hood, using this form to escape.\n\nChemistro suggests that they change their plan and instead use Deathlok to rob a federal reserve bank under the Baxter Building. In the process they gain over 15 million in cash and lose Deathlok in the ensuing chaos. He helped them fight the New Avengers but was taken down by Doctor Strange.\n\nIn ''[[Secret Invasion]]'', he is one among many supervillains who rejoined the Hood's crime syndicate and attacked an invading [[Skrull]] force.<ref>''Secret Invasion'' #6</ref>\n\nHe joins with the Hood's gang in an attack on the New Avengers, who were expecting the [[Dark Avengers]] instead.<ref>''The New Avengers'' #50</ref> He later orchestrates a power-draining trap that was meant for the Dark Avengers only to end up having the New Avengers in his trap.<ref>''The New Avengers'' #55</ref> Chemistro was seen during the [[Siege (comics)|Siege]] of [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]] as part of the Hood crime syndicate.<ref>''The New Avengers'' #63</ref> Later Calvin is shown to be arrested, along with other members of the Hood's gang, by the U.S. Army.<ref>''Dark Avengers'' #16</ref>\n\nDuring the ''[[Shadowland (comics)|Shadowland]]'' storyline, Chemistro was seen as member of Flashmob (a group of former opponents of Luke Cage consisting of [[Cheshire Cat (comics)|Cheshire Cat]], [[Comanche (comics)|Comanche]], [[Dontrell Hamilton|Dontrell \"Cockroach\" Hamilton]], [[Mr. Fish]] II, and [[Spear (comics)|Spear]]) when they confront the new [[Power Man (Victor Alvarez)|Power Man]] on the rooftop. Although Chemistro used his alchemy gun to free Iron Fist and Luke Cage, he was knocked out by Power Man. Chemistro ended up incarcerated at Ryker's Island. Although [[Nightshade (Marvel Comics)|Deadly Nightshade]]'s solicitor [[Big Ben Donovan]] mentioned that he has arranged for Chemistro to be released from Riker's Island.<ref>''Shadowland: Power Man'' #2</ref>\n\nDuring the ''[[Spider-Island]]'' storyline, Chemistro is among the villains that have been infected by the bedbugs that bestowed spider powers on him. He alongside Cheshire Cat, Commanche, [[Cottonmouth (Cornell Cottonmouth)|Cottonmouth]], Dontrell \"Cockroach\" Hamilton, [[Mr. Fish]] II, [[Nightshade (Marvel Comics)|Nightshade]], and Spear ended up fighting [[Heroes for Hire]].<ref>''Spider-Island: Heroes for Hire'' #1</ref>\n\nChemistro is among the Iron Man villains recruited by [[Mandarin (comics)|Mandarin]] and [[Zeke Stane]] to participate in a plot to take down Iron Man.<ref>''Invincible Iron Man'' #513</ref> Chemistro tried to kill Tony Stark (who had to take his armor away for legal issues) alongside [[Mauler (comics)|Mauler]]. The new Iron Man arrived and saved Stark, but also killed Chemistro in the act.<ref>''Invincible Iron Man'' #520</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nCurtis Carr is a gifted research scientist, with advanced degrees in chemistry, physics, and mechanical engineering. He is a highly skilled inventor and built his alchemy gun, which fires radiation able to transmute any substance into any other form of matter. He also built a \"nullifier\" rifle which is able to neutralize and reverse the effects of the alchemy gun, and Arch Morton's transmutation powers. The devices are cybernetically linked to the user, enabling him to work any transformation he can imagine. The transformed material usually turns to dust after exposure to heat or after a certain amount of time. Therefore, his alchemy gun cannot be used merely to transmute substances, such as turning lead or rock into gold. As High-Tech, Carr employed an armored exoskeleton suit and various devices of his own invention.\n\nArchibald Morton was granted the ability to transmute substances by the touch of his left hand in a similar fashion after his experimental version of the alchemy gun exploded.\n\nCalvin Carr used a set of wrist-blasters designed by the [[Wizard (Marvel Comics)|Wizard]], which functioned in an identical manner as his brother's alchemy gun.\n\n==Other versions==\n===''House of M: Masters of Evil''===\nIn the ''[[House of M]]'' tie-in miniseries ''House of M: Masters of Evil'', the Calvin Carr incarnation of Chemistro appears as a member of the [[Hood (comics)|Hood]]'s [[Masters of Evil]].<ref>''House of M: Masters of Evil'' #1</ref>\n\n==In other media==\nThe Curtis Carr incarnation of Chemistro appears in ''[[The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes]]'', voiced by [[Nolan North]].{{cn|date=May 2022}} Introduced in the episode \"Breakout, Part 1\", this version was originally imprisoned in the [[Vault (Marvel Comics)|Vault]] before a technical malfunction facilitated a mass breakout. As of \"This Hostage Earth\", Chemistro joined the [[Masters of Evil]] in a plot to fuse Earth with [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]], only to be foiled by the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]. In \"Acts of Vengeance\", the [[Enchantress (Marvel Comics)|Enchantress]] eliminates Chemistro while seeking revenge on the Masters of Evil.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix3/carrcurtischemistro.htm|Chemistro I}}\n* {{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix3/chemistromorton.htm|Chemistro II}}\n* {{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix3/chemistrocarrcalvin.htm|Chemistro III}}\n\n{{Luke Cage}}\n\n[[Category:Characters created by George Tuska]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Kurt Busiek]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Marv Wolfman]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Steve Englehart]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1973]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1976]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1983]]\n[[Category:Fictional African-American people]]\n[[Category:Fictional amputees]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from Kansas]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from Wyoming]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics male supervillains]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]"}]}}}}
