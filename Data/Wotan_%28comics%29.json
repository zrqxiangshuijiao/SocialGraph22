Evetually, in a male body, he adopted the \"Wotan\" name  based upon Germanic and Norse mythology and gain a lust for power and knowledge, putting them at odds with Doctor Fate and other magical characters.  After the [[The New 52|New 52]] reboot, the character was then moved Earth 2 universe with a similar background; named '''Karel Wotan''', she is cursed by Nabu when she arrogantly challenged the mystic sorcerer by turning her skin green so he can recognize her no matter whom she may reincarnate into.
