He is an enemy of [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] and had a hand in his origin as part of the [[Weapon X]] Project.\n\n==Publication history==\nProfessor Thorton first appeared in ''[[Marvel Comics Presents]]'' #73 and was created by [[Barry Windsor-Smith]].\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nIn 1972, nearly twenty years before [[Wolverine (character)|Logan]] was romantically involved and abducted with [[Silver Fox (comics)|Silver Fox]] at Windsor snow lodge, Professor Thorton experimented on numerous mutants including [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]] and [[Mastodon (Weapon X)|Mastodon]]. He hired [[Carol Hines]] as his assistant and the scientist [[Abraham Cornelius]]. His experiments on Wolverine are responsible for his adamantium-laced skeleton.<ref>''Marvel Comics Presents'' #73. Marvel Comics.</ref> He is also connected to the creation of [[Alpha Flight]] on to developing super-soldiers for the US government. During the adamantium-lacing process, the physical trauma causes Wolverine to regress to violent animal behavior, prone to attacking anyone who comes near.<ref>''Marvel Comics Presents'' #74. Marvel Comics.</ref> At one point, Thorton's mysterious \"master\" takes control of Wolverine and has him attack everyone in the facility, cutting off Professor Thorton's right hand and killing him.<ref>''Marvel Comics Presents'' #79-83.

Professor Thorton activates a robotic android named Shiva which is programmed to destroy all of Project X's test subjects starting with Wolverine. Silver Fox (who works for another secret organization called [[Hydra (comics)|HYDRA]]) is revealed to be behind the entire plan and steps forward to interrogate Professor Thorton at gunpoint.

Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n==Other versions==\n* A version of the Professor (although insane) appears in the pages of ''[[Mutant X (comics)|Mutant X]]'', but is killed by [[Captain America]].<ref>''Mutant X'' #30.
