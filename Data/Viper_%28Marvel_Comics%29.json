'''Jordan Dixon''') is the first version of Viper. He was the brother of Leopold Stryke, also known as the costumed criminal [[Eel (comics)#Eel (Leopold Stryke)|Eel]]. They each formed costumed identities without the other realizing this fact.  Viper concealed this fact by using the alias of \"Dixon\" as his everyday last name. Together they joined the Crime Wave of the Cowled Commander, and the Viper battled the [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]] and [[Captain America]]. During the course of the fight, Viper managed to poison his opponents with darts and escaped. Later, the Falcon discovered the Viper in his home after tracking his alias (through an offhand comment made by the Viper indicating that he was involved in advertising) and captured him. Escaping in an ensuing battle with [[Plantman]] and the rest of the Crime Wave, Viper's identity was discovered by his brother Eel. Soon after, the Crime Wave was defeated by Captain America and the Falcon, and they were sent to prison.{{issue|date=May 2017}}\n\nLater escaping prison with his brother and the help of the Cobra, the trio formed the original [[Serpent Squad]] and attacked Captain America at his girlfriend's home in Virginia.  Despite new weapons added to his arsenal, including the Venom-Firer and prosthetic fangs, the Viper and his partners were returned to jail. While in custody, he was being taken to appear before a grand jury by [[U.S. Marshals]]. The van he was transported in was attacked by [[Viper (Madame Hydra)|Madame Hydra]], and his guards were killed. Believing himself rescued by his Serpent Squad, Viper rushed out of the van, only to be told by Madame Hydra that she wanted a new name \u2013 his name.  Despite offering to change his moniker, the Viper was gunned down and killed,<ref>''Captain America'' #180. Marvel Comics.</ref> and Madame Hydra assumed the name and leadership of the Serpent Squad. Later, his soul fragment was discovered by [[Dark Angel (Marvel Comics)|Hell's Angel]] and the [[X-Men]] in [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]]\u2019s realm and, with Jordan Stryke's usual luck, even this was destroyed.<ref>''Hell's Angel'' #2.

Very intelligent, he is a skilled debater and advertiser, and he is skilled enough in chemistry to create his own special form of venom. He wears venom-tipped claws and employs venom-tipped darts.{{issue|date=May 2017}}\n\nThe third version possessed great physical strength but was lacking in hand-to-hand combat skills. In battles with both [[Steve Rogers]] and [[Bucky Barnes]], he was taken out easily by a kick to the head. He used a wrist blaster that could fire poison darts.{{issue|date=May 2017}}\n\n==Other versions==\nDuring the 2017 ''[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]'' storyline, the [[Battleworld]] domain of the [[Hydra (comics)|Hydra Empire]] has a group called the '''Vipers''', a group of female assassins that wear Hydra's version of [[Symbiote (comics)|Symbiotes]] on their bodies and are led by [[Eddie Brock|Venom]].
