They are the [[twin]] children of [[Thena]], leader of the [[Eternals (comics)|Eternals]], and [[Kro (comics)|Kro]], sometime leader of the race of [[Deviant (comics)|Deviants]]. \n\n== Publication history ==\nThe Ritter twins were created by [[Roy Thomas]], [[Dann Thomas]] and [[Mark Texeira]]. The twins first appeared in the one-shot special ''Eternals: The Herod Factor''.\n\n==Fictional character biographies==\nThena and Kro, despite being members of two offshoots of humanity who have been traditional enemies, have had a relationship for over 25,000 years. During the [[Vietnam war]], the two had a sexual encounter, and Thena discovered she was [[Pregnancy|pregnant]]. Using her powers, she secretly implanted the [[embryo]]s into an infertile human woman, and the two grew up unaware of their ancestry. When Dr. [[Daniel Damian]], a human who was aware of the existence of Deviants and Eternals, sent a monster (formerly [[Ajak]]) to slay the two children, killing numerous other sets of twins in the process, Thena took the two to [[Olympia (comics)|Olympia]], the city of Eternals, but did not inform them of their heritage. However, even Olympia proved unsafe, and the monster captured the two and fled to [[Peru]], where they confronted Damian. The Twins learned of their true origin, and were rescued by Kro and Thena.<ref>''Eternals the Herod Factor'' #1 (1991). Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nThe Ritter twins have been shown few times since then; In ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]'' #370-371, the two joined Kro's [[Delta Network]], and demonstrated the ability to merge into a two-mouthed, four-eyed and four-armed creature calling itself Tzabaoth. In ''[[Heroes for Hire]]'' #6, they again merged, this time forming into a sleek, winged metallic creature called Dark Angel. In both stories, the twins were supposedly merging for the \"first\" time, and both stories also portrayed the \"resurrection\" of the Deviant [[Ghaur]], suggesting that perhaps the writers of these stories were unaware that these characters had already been used in this way.<ref>''Heroes for Hire'' (vol. 2) #5-7. (1997) Marvel Comics.</ref>\n \nThey were briefly captured by the villain [[Maelstrom (comics)|Maelstrom]], but rescued by the Eternals and Kro.<ref>''Fantastic Four Unlimited'' #10. (1995) Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n== Powers and abilities ==\nThe Ritter twins are able to merge their bodies into a single entity. When this happens, they gained the following powers:{{issue|date=December 2012}}\n\n* '''Optic Blasts''': The gestalt form can project energy from its eyes.\n* '''Superhuman Strength'''\n* '''Wings''': The Ritter twins also have wings in their gestalt form that allows them to fly.\n\n==Notes==\nThe Ritter Twins are not the only characters to use the identity of '''Dark Angel'''.
