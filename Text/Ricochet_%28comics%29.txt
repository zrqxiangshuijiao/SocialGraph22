Starting with a leather jacket with an ''R'' on it, his [[Mary Jane Watson|wife]] created a costume and weapons. Ricochet was similar to Spider-Man, but even more [[jocular]]. He relied primarily on his agility, and posed as a criminal for hire. Using this identity, Peter collaborated for a time with his old foe [[Delilah (comics)|Delilah]] in searching for information about the new villain [[Black Tarantula]], and they battled [[Roughouse]] and [[Bloodscream]] together.

The character was created by Joseph Harris and Adam Pollina.\n\nRicochet appeared as a supporting character in ''[[Avengers Academy]]'', first in issue #21 (Jan. 2012), and occasionally thereafter in the series.\n\n===Fictional character biography===\nJohnny was a college student who lived with his widowed father. He carefully concealed from both his father and his girlfriend Kathy the fact that he was a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]], endowed with superior agility and the ability to sense danger. The [[Black Marvel]] presented Johnny with the Ricochet costume and the chance to be part of his team, the [[Slingers (Marvel Comics)|Slingers]]. Johnny accepted, becoming the new Ricochet. He could freely use his powers to help people without revealing his mutant nature. Much like Spider-Man, Ricochet enjoyed joking during the heat of battle, even though this annoyed his teammates, especially team leader [[Prodigy (Ritchie Gilmore)|Prodigy]]. Another of the Slingers, the [[Hornet (comics)|Hornet]], became Ricochet's closest friend, and gave him special throwing discs to use in battle. [[Dusk (comics)|Dusk]], also a teammate, was attracted to Ricochet, but he did not have the same feelings for her. Using his leaping abilities and reflexes, Ricochet fought crime lords, mutated vermin, and even [[Spider-Man]] himself. Ricochet learned that Black Marvel had made a deal with [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]], the demon king, to recruit the youths who would become the Slingers, and that Mephisto held Black Marvel captive. Ricochet was the first to suggest abandoning their \"mentor\" when offered the chance to save him, but Hornet convinced him to free Black Marvel. Shortly after, the Slingers disbanded.<ref>''Slingers'' #0-12</ref>\n\nLater, Ricochet became disillusioned because his efforts had not earned him any fame or recognition, and he blamed himself for the Hornet's death at the hands of a brainwashed [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]]. He joined another team of teen heroes, [[Loners (comics)|Excelsior]] (now called the Loners), whose goal was to dissuade other superpowered young people from becoming heroes. During the aftermath of [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]], when a majority of mutants lost their powers, Ricochet was one of the few who kept his abilities.{{issue|date=November 2011}}\n\n===The Initiative===\nJohnny is being considered as a 'potential recruit' for the [[Avengers: The Initiative|Initiative]] program, according to ''Civil War: Battle Damage Report''.  He is currently in Los Angeles alongside other 'retired' superheroes.  He has been seen (along with the other members of the Loners) as one of the newer, part-time students at the [[Avengers Academy]].<ref>''Avengers Academy'' #21</ref>\n\n===Scarlet Spider===\nFollowing [[Hydra (comics)|Hydra]]'s [[Secret Empire (comics)|takeover of America]], after a figure that appears to be the Hornet attacks a food delivery to a casino owned by Cassandra Mercury, Ricochet appears to save the [[Ben Reilly|Scarlet Spider]] from an attack by the Hornet, telling the other hero that he is there to find out how his 'dead' friend can be alive.<ref>''Ben Reilly: Scarlet Spider'' #8</ref> Ricochet claims that he arrived in Las Vegas by chance to act as a new hero for the city, but although the Scarlet Spider allows Ricochet to accompany him to the casino that apparently hired Hornet, he webs Ricochet to the roof of the casino because he was unsatisfied with the other's explanation. Ricochet escapes the webbing by removing his boots, but when they confront the Hornet, he uses an amulet to summon an other-dimensional monster.<ref>''Ben Reilly: Scarlet Spider'' #9</ref>\n\n===Powers and abilities===\nRicochet has the mutant power of superhuman agility, enabling him to leap great distances. He has incredible reflexes and coordination which, combined with his leaping powers, allow him to seemingly bounce off walls (ricochet, as it were). Ricochet's mutant powers also give him a \"Danger Sense\" that functions much like Spider-Man's \"Spider-Sense\". Thanks to Hornet, Ricochet has special throwing discs, which he stores on the sleeves of his jacket. His original discs could bounce off walls and targets with incredible force. Hornet later gave Ricochet discs that could explode on impact. Ricochet's super reflexes and coordination enable him to throw his discs with amazing speed and accuracy.\n\n==In other media==\n\n===Television===\nThe Ricochet persona is used in ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man (TV series)|The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' animated series by '''[[Fancy Dan]]''' (voiced by [[Phil LaMarr]]{{cn|date=January 2018}}), a member of the [[Enforcers (comics)|Enforcers]] who uses a suit that gives him the power to bounce around at high speeds.\n\n===Video games===\n* The Ricochet costume appears as an alternate costume for Spider-Man (Peter Parker) in ''[[Spider-Man: Edge of Time]]'', available as [[downloadable content]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5820648/gamestop-wreaks-havok-on-the-x+men-gives-spider+man-an-identity-crisis/gallery/1 |title=GameStop Wreaks Havok on the X-Men, Gives Spider-Man an Identity Crisis |publisher=Kotaku.com |date=July 12, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thehdroom.com/news/Spider-Man-Edge-of-Time-Retailer-Exclusive-Bonus-Suits-Trailers/9548 |title=Spider-Man: Edge of Time Retailer Exclusive Bonus Suits Trailers |publisher=Thehdroom.com .|date=September 18, 2011}}</ref>\n* The Ricochet costume appears as an alternate costume for Spider-Man in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (2014 video game)|The Amazing Spider-Man 2]]'' video game. In-game information states that \"The Amazing Ricochet\" is a comic book series that Peter was a fan of as a child, with Parker being inspired to create a duplicate of Ricochet's costume after finding an appropriately-styled leather jacket.\n\n==DC Comics==\nAn unrelated Ricochet appears in ''[[Hawkman]] Annual'' #1. This Ricochet is an acrobatic criminal with the ability to leap across  great distances, and was genetically engineered for the Sunderland Corporation by Dr. Moon. He fights [[Hawkman (Katar Hol)#Post-Hawkworld version|Katar Hol]] and [[Hawkwoman#Shayera Thal|Shayera Thal]] in [[Chicago]], and loses.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://marvel.com/universe/Ricochet_%28Johnny_Gallo%29 Ricochet (Johnny Gallo)] at Marvel.com\n* {{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix4/ricochetgallo.htm|Johnny Gallo}}\n\n{{Spider-Man}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ricochet (Comics)}}\n[[Category:Articles about multiple fictional characters]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1998]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from New York City]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters with precognition]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters with superhuman strength]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics mutants]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics superheroes]]"}]}}}}
