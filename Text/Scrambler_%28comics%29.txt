In the course of this mutant massacre, the Marauders clashed with the mutant adventurers known as the [[X-Men]] and the original [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]] team.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #210-213</ref><ref>''X-Factor'' #9-11</ref> Subsequently, the X-Men thwarted the Marauders' attempt to assassinate Sinister's former pawn, [[Madelyne Pryor]], in San Francisco.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #221-222</ref>\n\nLater, Sinister sent the Marauders to battle the X-Men during the time of the demonic invasion of [[New York City]] known as the \"Inferno\".<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #240-241</ref>  The Marauders were all killed during the \"Inferno\",<ref name=autogenerated1>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #240</ref> but Sinister possesses the ability to clone them thanks to samples of their DNA.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> The Marauders later clashed with the dimensionally-displaced young mutant known as [[X-Man|Nate Grey]] after they attempted to assassinate Sinister's former servant, [[Threnody (comics)|Threnody]].<ref>''X-Man'' #13</ref>\n\n===Endangered Species/Messiah Complex===\nScrambler later returns alongside the reorganized Marauders.<ref>''[[X-Men: Legacy|X-Men]]'' (vol. 2) #200</ref>\n\nDuring the final battle for the mutant baby, the first birth since Decimation, Scrambler goes over to Wolverine and shuts off his healing factor so that he won't heal from the bullet, after being shot in the eye by Scalphunter. However, [[X-23]] appears and literally dismantles Scrambler, cutting off both his hands and eviscerating him.<ref>''New X-Men'' (vol. 2) #46</ref>\n\n===Recovery/Reformation===\nThe ''Deadpool V Gambit'' miniseries reveals that Scrambler was found by paramedics, who saved his life. At the suggestion of [[She-Hulk|Jennifer Walters]], Kim agrees to testify against Scalphunter in exchange for being placed on parole. Giving up his supervillain life, Kim gets a pair of prosthetic hands (which he can use his powers to manipulate), takes a job at an auto garage, and falls in love.<ref>''Deadpool V Gambit: The \"V\" is for \"Versus\"'' #4</ref>\n\nAfter being attacked by a vengeful Scalphunter, Kim is embroiled in one of [[Loki (Marvel Comics)|Loki]]'s schemes, and set against [[Deadpool]] and Gambit, scrambling both their power sets. The mercenary duo manage to regain control over their abilities after Gambit charges Deadpool and throws him at Kim. Kim survives the experience, and once more swears off villainy, using the land meant for the defeated Loki to make a new home for himself, his girlfriend, and her daughter.<ref>''Deadpool V Gambit: The \"V\" is for \"Versus\"'' #5</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nScrambler is a mutant who possesses the ability to disrupt any system with his touch. His touch disrupts systems, whether they be a living being, a machine, or a field of energy. Scrambler must physically touch his target in order to affect it. Scrambler can control the effect  so that, in the case of a nervous system, he can cause immobilization, unconsciousness, or seizures. If his victim is a metahuman who possesses powers, Scrambler can cancel or disrupt the function of those powers, often causing them to go into overdrive, in which they flare up and then burn out for a certain period of time.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n{{John Romita Jr.}}\n\n[[Category:Characters created by Chris Claremont]]\n[[Category:Characters created by John Romita Jr.]]\n[[Category:Clone characters in comics]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1986]]\n[[Category:Fictional Korean people]]\n[[Category:Fictional mercenaries in comics]]\n[[Category:Fictional murderers]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics mutants]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]"}]}}}}
