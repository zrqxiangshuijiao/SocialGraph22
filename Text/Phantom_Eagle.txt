If you know anything of that time in history or the feel of that time, you would know that it was just so wrong. But it was fun and I got to make up some of the airplanes. ... [T]he Phantom Eagle airplanes were all made up, and not patterned after a real airplane, but an original design by me. ... It had a kind of corny design pattern painted on it, like wings and that kind of stuff, which was not that far from what the pilots painted on their planes.

The first was a time travel story in ''[[The Incredible Hulk (comic book)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' (vol. 2) #135 (January 1971). Next came a [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] appearance in ''[[Ghost Rider]]'' #12 (June 1975), in which the Phantom Eagle, as the cover proclaimed, was a real phantom. ''[[The Invaders (comics)|The Invaders]]'' #7 (July 1976) [[retconned]] the character as a member of the [[Freedom's Five]], a newly created World War I team of costumed adventurers never subsequently seen.

Kaufman had become an expert stunt-pilot and co-owner of a flying circus, by 1917, when the United States entered [[World War I]], and desired to fight the [[Central Powers]]. Concealing his identity so as not to risk reprisals against his parents, he devised a stylized aviator uniform with darkened goggles and a cape, and joined the European conflict to become an ace on the side of the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] as a U.S. Army Air Corps test pilot. In his first mission as Phantom Eagle, he successfully led a U.S. fighter squadron against an experimental dirigible aircraft carrier with which German forces attempted to invade New York; however, he witnessed the death of his best friend, Rex Griffin, as a result.<ref>[http://toonopedia.com/phaneagm.htm Phantom Eagle (Marvel Comics)] at Don Mark Stein's Toonopedia.
