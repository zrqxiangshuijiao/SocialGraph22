Giganto has been seen across two separate instances in the Marvel Universe.\n\n==Publication history==\nThe Deviant Mutate version of Giganto was first seen in ''Fantastic Four'' #1 and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]].\n\n==Fictional character biographies==\n===Giganto (Deviant Mutate)===\n{{Infobox comics character <!--Wikipedia:WikiProject Comics-->\n|image=Giganto1.jpg\n|caption=Giganto makes his first appearance battling the Fantastic Four as seen on the cover of<br>''Fantastic Four'' #1.\n|character_name=Giganto\n|real_name=\n|species=Humanity Subspecies\n|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]\n|debut=''[[Fantastic Four]]'' #1 (Nov. 1961)\n|creators=[[Stan Lee]]<br>[[Jack Kirby]]\n|status=\n|partners=Inorganic Technodrones<br>[[Kro (comics)|Kro]]<br>[[Mole Man]]\n|aliases=\n|relatives=\n|powers=Superhuman strength and endurance<br>Ability to dig underground and hold his breath underwater\n}}\nThe first Giganto seen was one of the mutates created by the [[Deviant (comics)|Deviant]] scientists to serve as part of [[Kro (comics)|Kro]]'s invasion force when gathered on Monster Island. After Monster Hunters forced Kro to leave Monster Island, Giganto and the other Deviant Mutates found a new master known as the [[Mole Man]] and the Deviant Mutates live with him in [[Subterranea (comics)|Subterranea]].<ref>''Marvel Universe'' #7</ref>\n\nThe Mole Man unleashed Giganto upon the surface world to attack and destroy chemical plants in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, Australia, South America, and French Africa.

[[Iron Man]] intercepted Giganto and threw him into the sea while he and [[U.S. Agent (comics)|U.S. Agent]] had an attempt to decide what to do with it. When Giganto moved again, U.S. Agent tried to blind it with the afterburners on his skycycle only for Giganto to strike and U.S. Agent was separated from his vehicle. Wonder Man convinced [[Mole Man]] that the Avengers weren't responsible and blew his monster whistle to recall his monsters.<ref>''Avengers West Coast'' #54</ref>\n\nA [[Skrull]] named De'Lila was brainwashing Giganto and the rest of Mole Man's monsters. Giganto was sent as a diversion while she looked for the lost Inorganic Technodrone.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #347</ref> Giganto was used by Mole Men to capture Skrulls that were also looking for the Inorganic Technodrone.

It attempted to crush Hulk before it was stabbed by Wolverine.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #348</ref> The Inorganic Technodrone was finally found by Giganto's mate who had laid on the flying saucer containing it thinking it was a nest.

This inspired the legend of [[Moby-Dick]].<ref>''Marvel Universe'' #7</ref>\n\nWhen Prince [[Namor]] believed that the surface world was destroying Atlantis, he blew the Horn of Proteus to awaken a Giganto and unleashed it on the surface world. [[Mister Fantastic]] of the [[Fantastic Four]] attempted to slow it down with a smokescreen emitted by the Fantasticar, but was forced to withdraw when the [[Human Torch]] attempted to help and ended up having his flame extinguished by Giganto's blowhole attack. In order to destroy Giganto, [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] strapped a bomb to his back and walked into the monster's mouth and planted the bomb there.
