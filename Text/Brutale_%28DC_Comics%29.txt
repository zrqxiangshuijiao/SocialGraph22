When the Marxist regime of Hasaragua fell, Barrera escaped the country to America, fleeing execution for the atrocities he committed.<ref name=\"dc-ency\">{{Citation  | last = Jimenez | first = Phil | author-link = Phil Jimenez | contribution = Brutale | editor-last = Dougall  | editor-first = Alastair  | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia  | pages = 62  | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]  | place = London  | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-0-7566-4119-1}}</ref>\n\nAdopting the name Brutale, Barrera put his 'Surgical Skills' to use as a hired assassin.

When the [[Parademon]]s under [[Desaad]]'s command attacked the camp, Brutale was stabbed by one of them.<ref>''Salvation Run'' #7 (July 2008)</ref> However, he was seen alive in the new ''[[Secret Six (comics)|Secret Six]]'' mini-series.\n\nBrutale is featured in one issue of the ''Red Robin'' series. He is listed as one of the targets of Tim Drake-Wayne/Red Robin for his \"Hit List\". Red Robin catches him at a bar, attempting to terrorize the owners into paying fees due to a gang boss. He is accompanied by what Red Robin assumes is his 'girlfriend', who manages to escape as Red Robin takes Brutale down using his Escrima sticks.\n\nIn [[The New 52]], Brutale is reintroduced in the first issue of ''[[Jaime Reyes|Blue Beetle]]'' where he appears to be working for [[La Dama]]'s group who are attempting to steal the scarab.<ref>''Blue Beetle'' vol. 3 #1 (November 2011)</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nBrutale has no superhuman powers, but is an expert with all forms of knives and blades, being able to both fight superbly and inflict horrible pain on his victims. He has a variety of scalpels, throwing knives and other razor keen blades that he utilizes.<ref name=\"dc-ency\"/>\n\n==In other media==\n* Guillermo Barrera appears in the ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'''s first season episode \"Dead to Rights\", portrayed by George Tchortov.
