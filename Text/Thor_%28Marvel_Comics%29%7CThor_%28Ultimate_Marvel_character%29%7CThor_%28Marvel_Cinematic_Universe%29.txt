In the MCU, he is depicted as one of the most powerful [[Asgardians (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Asgardians]], an ancient alien civilization with long ties to Earth, who humans consider to be [[Norse gods|gods]]. Thor wields a powerful hammer called [[Mjolnir (Marvel Comics)#Marvel Cinematic Universe|Mjolnir]], and is initially depicted as the arrogant heir to the throne of Asgard whose brash behaviors causes turmoil among the [[Nine Realms]] under Asgard's protection. This brings him into conflict with his villainous adopted brother, [[Loki (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Loki]]. Thor commits himself to the protection of Earth, and becomes a founding member of the [[Avengers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Avengers]]. Thor eventually becomes the King of Asgard after [[Odin (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Odin]]'s death, but the entire realm is destroyed during the battle with his sister [[Hela (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Hela]]. Thor then comes into conflict with [[Thanos (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thanos]], who slaughters half of the Asgardians and uses the [[Infinity Stones]] to erase half of the life in the universe before Thor himself kills Thanos. Thor later joins his fellow Avengers in obtaining the Stones from the past using [[time travel]] and they successfully undo Thanos' actions. When an alternate version of Thanos enters their timeline, Thor and his allies manage to defeat him. Thor then passes the crown of [[New Asgard]] to [[Valkyrie (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Valkyrie]] and joins the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]. Thor later comes into conflict with [[Gorr (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Gorr the God Butcher]] and the Olympian god [[Zeus (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Zeus]], while reconnecting with his terminally ill ex-girlfriend, the now Mjolnir-wielding [[Jane Foster (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Jane Foster]]. After Foster succumbs to her cancer to assist in Gorr's defeat, Thor adopts the latter's daughter, Love.   \n\n{{As of|2022}}, Thor is a central figure of the MCU, having appeared in eight films, the most-recent being ''[[Thor: Love and Thunder]]'' (2022). Although the first two ''Thor'' films have been among the less well-received films in the MCU, ''Thor: Ragnarok'', with its substantial reinvention of the character, has been held up as one of the best MCU films and often credited as positively rebooting Thor and his storyline, and the reception of his character has become much more favorable.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Abad-Santos |first1=Alex |title=Thor: Ragnarok finally makes Thor a hero worth rooting for |url=https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/10/26/16537186/thor-ragnarok-review |website=vox.com |publisher=[[Vox (website)|Vox]] |access-date=April 27, 2021 |date=November 2, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Chitwood |first1=Adam |title=How the MCU Was Made: 'Thor: Ragnarok' and How Marvel Rebooted Its Own Franchise |url=https://collider.com/thor-ragnarok-making-of-reboot-chris-hemsworth/ |website=collider.com |publisher=[[Collider (website)|Collider]] |access-date=April 27, 2021 |date=August 21, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Huver |first1=Scott |title=Ragnarok's Waititi Tried To Break Thor To Save The Franchise |url=https://www.cbr.com/interview-thor-ragnarok-taika-waititi-director/ |website=cbr.com |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |date=October 30, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Zoller Seitz |first1=Matt |title=Thor: Ragnarok |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/thor-ragnarok-2017 |website=rogerebert.com |publisher=[[RogerEbert.com]] |access-date=April 27, 2021 |date=November 3, 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[#Alternate versions|Alternate versions]] of the character appear in the animated series ''[[What If...?

He is initially impulsive, invading Jotunheim, the home of the frost giants, in the first film. This leads directly to Odin banishing him to Earth, and indirectly to Loki's attempt to overthrow Asgard after Loki learns that he was born a frost giant and adopted by Odin.

Against Odin's order, Thor travels to [[Features of the Marvel Cinematic Universe#Jotunheim|Jotunheim]] to confront Frost Giant leader [[Laufey (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Laufey]], accompanied by Loki, childhood friend [[Sif (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Sif]], and the [[Warriors Three (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Warriors Three]]: [[Volstagg (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Voltstagg]], [[Fandral (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Fandral]], and [[Hogun (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Hogun]]. A battle ensues until Odin intervenes, destroying the fragile truce between the two races. For Thor's arrogance, Odin strips his son of his godly power and exiles him to Earth. Odin casts an enchantment on Mjolnir, ensuring that only those who are worthy may wield the hammer. Thor lands in [[New Mexico]], meeting scientist Dr. [[Erik Selvig]], [[astrophysicist]] Dr. [[Jane Foster (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Jane Foster]], and Foster's intern [[Darcy Lewis]]. Thor resigns himself to exile on Earth, where he develops a relationship with Foster. Odin enters the \"Odinsleep\", a period of rest needed to maintain his power, and Loki, having learned he is actually an adopted Frost Giant, seizes the Asgardian throne and prepares to conquer the Nine Realms. The Warriors Three and Sif find Thor, but the [[Destroyer (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Destroyer]] attacks and defeats them, prompting Thor to offer himself instead. Struck by the Destroyer and near death, Thor's selflessness proves him worthy to wield Mjolnir. The hammer returns to him, restoring his powers and enabling him to defeat the Destroyer. Thor returns to Asgard and fights Loki before destroying the [[Features of the Marvel Cinematic Universe#Bifrost|Bifr\u00f6st Bridge]] to stop Loki's plans, stranding himself in Asgard. Odin prevents the brothers from falling into the abyss, but Loki appears to commit suicide when Odin rejects his pleas for approval. Thor makes amends with Odin, admitting he is not ready to rule.\n\n===Joining the Avengers===\n{{see|The Avengers (2012 film)}}\nIn 2012, Odin sends Thor back to Earth using dark magic after learning Loki is alive and is attempting to conquer the Earth. He finds Loki on a [[Features of the Marvel Cinematic Universe#Quinjet|Quinjet]], held captive by [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark]], [[Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Steve Rogers]], and [[Natasha Romanoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Natasha Romanoff]]. Thor takes Loki away, hoping to convince him to abandon his plan. However, Stark and Rogers pursue Thor and after a brief confrontation, Thor agrees to take Loki to [[S.H.I.E.L.D. (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'s flying aircraft carrier, the [[Features of the Marvel Cinematic Universe#Helicarriers|Helicarrier]]. Agents including [[Clint Barton (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Clint Barton]], who were mind controlled by Loki, attack the Helicarrier, disabling one of its engines in flight and causing [[Bruce Banner (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Bruce Banner]] to transform into the Hulk. Thor attempts to stop the Hulk's rampage and both are ejected from the Helicarrier as Loki escapes. Thor then becomes a founding member of the [[Avengers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Avengers]] upon returning to help Rogers, Stark, Banner, Romanoff, and Barton when Loki uses the [[Tesseract (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tesseract]] to open a [[wormhole]] over [[New York City]] to allow a [[Chitauri (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Chitauri]] army to invade. Thor and the Avengers fight off the Chitauri and save the city. After Loki is defeated at [[Features of the Marvel Cinematic Universe#Avengers Tower|Stark Tower]], Thor returns to Asgard with Loki and the Tesseract.\n\n===Battle with the Dark Elves===\n{{see|Thor: The Dark World}}\nIn 2013, having used the Tesseract to rebuild the Bifrost and bring the Nine Realms to peace, Thor and his fellow warriors learn that the Convergence of the realms is imminent, with portals linking the worlds appearing at random. [[Heimdall (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Heimdall]] alerts Thor that Jane Foster has left his near all-seeing vision, leading Thor to go to Earth. Jane inadvertently releases an unearthly force, and Thor returns with her to Asgard. Odin recognizes this force as a weapon known as the [[Aether (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Aether]], warning that it will kill Jane, and that its return heralds a catastrophic prophecy. The [[Characters of the Marvel Cinematic Universe#Elves|Dark Elves]], led by [[Malekith (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Malekith]], attack Asgard, searching for Jane. Thor's mother Frigga is killed protecting Jane, and Malekith is forced to flee. Against Odin's orders to stay in Asgard, Thor reluctantly frees Loki, who knows a secret portal to [[Features of the Marvel Cinematic Universe#Svartalfheim|Svartalfheim]], home of the Dark Elves, in return for Thor's promise to take vengeance for their mother. In Svartalfheim, Loki tricks Malekith into drawing the Aether out of Jane, but Thor's attempt to destroy the exposed substance fails. Malekith merges with the Aether and leaves in his ship as Loki is fatally wounded. Thor and Jane return to [[London]] through another portal. Thor ultimately defeats Malekith in a battle in [[Greenwich]], and returns to Asgard to decline Odin's offer to take the throne, and tells Odin of Loki's sacrifice. Thor then returns to Earth and reunites with Jane.\n\n===Ultron and the Battle of Sokovia===\n{{see|Avengers: Age of Ultron}}\nIn 2015, Thor and the Avengers raid a [[Hydra (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Hydra]] facility in [[Sokovia]] and find [[Loki's scepter]]. Back at Avengers Tower, Stark and Banner discover an [[Artificial intelligence in fiction#Sentient AI|artificial intelligence]] within the scepter's gem, and secretly decide to use it to complete Stark's \"[[Ultron (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Ultron]]\" global defense program. After the Avengers host a celebratory party and Thor reveals he and Jane have ended their relationship, the unexpectedly sentient Ultron attacks Thor, [[James Rhodes (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|James Rhodes]], and the other Avengers before escaping with the scepter. The team tracks Ultron down in [[Johannesburg]], but [[Wanda Maximoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Wanda Maximoff]] subdues them with [[hallucinations|hallucinatory]] visions. Following this, Thor and the team go to Barton's home to recover, however, Thor leaves them in order to consult with Selvig on the meaning of the apocalyptic future he saw in his hallucination. Thor and Selvig go to a mystical well, where Thor has a vision of the Infinity Stones, the most powerful objects in existence. Returning to the Tower, Thor finds out that Stark secretly uploaded [[J.A.R.V.I.S. (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|J.A.R.V.I.S.]] into a synthetic [[vibranium]] body captured from Ultron and helps activate the body, dubbed the [[Vision (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Vision]], explaining that the gem on his forehead is one of the six Infinity Stones. Thor and the team return to Sokovia where they engage in the final battle against Ultron and manage to defeat him. At the new [[Avengers Compound (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Avengers Compound]], Thor tells Rogers and Stark that he is leaving to go back into space to learn more about the forces he suspects have manipulated recent events and leaves Earth using the Bifrost.\n\n===Ragnarok===\n{{see|Thor: Ragnarok}}\nIn 2017, Thor is imprisoned in [[Features of the Marvel Cinematic Universe#Musphelheim|Muspelheim]] by [[Surtur (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Surtur]]. Surtur claims he will destroy Asgard in the prophesied [[Ragnar\u00f6k]], when his crown is placed into the Eternal Flame in Odin's vault. Thor escapes, fights and defeats Surtur and retrieves the crown, believing he has prevented Ragnar\u00f6k. While returning the crown to Asgard, he finds Loki still alive and posing as Odin. He takes Loki back to New York City. With the help of [[Stephen Strange (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Stephen Strange]], they find a dying Odin in [[Norway]], who explains that his passing will allow his firstborn child, [[Hela (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Hela]], to escape from a prison she was sealed in millennia ago. She appears, destroys Mjolnir and forces Thor and Loki from the Bifrost out into space. Thor crash-lands on the planet [[Features of the Marvel Cinematic Universe#Sakaar|Sakaar]], and is captured by [[Valkyrie (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Valkyrie]], a former member of the ancient Asgardian order of [[Valkyrior#In other media|Valkyries]] defeated by Hela. Thor is forced to compete in the [[Grandmaster (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Grandmaster]]'s Tournament of Champions and he befriends fellow [[gladiator]]s, [[Korg (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Korg]] and [[Miek (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Miek]]. After defeating Hulk, the champion of the Grandmaster, Thor finds the Quinjet that brought Hulk to Sakaar. A video recording of Romanoff helps Hulk transform back into Banner and after convincing Valkyrie and Loki to help, they escape through a wormhole to Asgard \u2013 but not before Loki betrays his brother, and is left behind on Sakaar. In the midst of the battle with Hela's forces, Loki returns aboard the Grandmaster's vessel, the ''[[Statesman (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Statesman]]''. He and Heimdall help Asgardians escape into the ship. Thor, facing Hela, loses an eye and through a vision of Odin realizes his true potential and unlocks his hidden powers but soon realises that Ragnarok is the only way to stop Hela. He has Loki place Surtur's crown in the Eternal Flame, and Surtur destroys Asgard and Hela. Thor, crowned king, decides to take his people to Earth, but they are intercepted by ''Sanctuary II'', [[Thanos (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thanos]]' warship.\n\n===Combating Thanos and the Infinity War===\n{{Further|Avengers: Infinity War}}\nOn a destroyed ''Statesman'', Thor is threatened by Thanos using the [[Power Stone (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Power Stone]], until Loki gives him the Space Stone within the Tesseract. Before he does, he calls on the Hulk, but Thanos overpowers Hulk and kills Heimdall. After Loki is killed by Thanos, Thor clutches his brother's body as Thanos obliterates the ''Statesman'' leaving Thor to die in the open space. Thor survives and is rescued by the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Guardians of the Galaxy]] \u2014 [[Peter Quill (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Peter Quill]], [[Gamora (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Gamora]], [[Drax (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Drax the Destroyer]], [[Mantis (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Mantis]], [[Rocket (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Rocket]], and [[Groot (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Groot]] \u2014 and they tell Thor about Thanos' quest to find the Infinity Stones and erase half of all life in the universe. Needing a new weapon, Thor leaves in a space pod with Rocket and Groot to [[Features of the Marvel Cinematic Universe#Nidavellir|Nidavellir]], and Rocket gives Thor a cybernetic replacement eye. They find that Nidavellir has been ravaged by Thanos and meet the dwarf king [[Eitri (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Eitri]]. Thor repairs the damaged [[forge]], and they work together to create Stormbreaker, a powerful axe that also grants Thor the power of the Bifrost. Thor transports himself, Rocket, and Groot to [[Wakanda (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Wakanda]] on Earth to help Rogers, Romanoff, Banner, Rhodes, [[Sam Wilson (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Sam Wilson]], [[Bucky Barnes (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Bucky Barnes]], [[T'Challa (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|T'Challa]], and the Wakandan army in the battle against the [[Outriders (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Outriders]]. Thor is able to defeat scores of Outriders and uses Stormbreaker to severely wound Thanos. However, Thanos manages to activate the completed Infinity Gauntlet by snapping his fingers, initiating [[the Blip]]. Thanos teleports away and Thor is left to watch in horror when Barnes, Maximoff, Wilson, T'Challa, and Groot disintegrate.\n\n===Avenging the fallen and the Time Heist===\n{{Further|Avengers: Endgame}}\nThor, along with the surviving Avengers and Rocket, return to the [[Avengers Compound (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Avengers Compound]] to assess the damage. Three weeks later, Thor goes with Rogers, Romanoff, Banner, Rhodes, Rocket, [[Carol Danvers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Carol Danvers]] and [[Nebula (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Nebula]] into space to Titan II to confront Thanos. After discovering that Thanos destroyed the Stones to prevent further use, an enraged Thor decapitates him with Stormbreaker. Sometime between 2018 and 2023, Thor and the remaining Asgardians settle in [[T\u00f8nsberg]], Norway where they create a colony called [[New Asgard]]. Thor becomes an [[overweight]] [[alcoholism|alcoholic]] as a result of his [[post-traumatic stress disorder|trauma]]. \n\nIn 2023, Rocket and Banner arrive in New Asgard and urge Thor to return to the Avengers and hear their plan to undo Thanos' actions. Thor returns to the Compound, reuniting with the Avengers, and learns of the plan to time travel via the [[Quantum Realm]] to collect the Infinity Stones from different points in the past. He and Rocket travel to Asgard in an alternate 2013 where he meets an alternate Frigga, who reignites Thor's sense of purpose, and he regains an alternate version of Mjolnir. Upon returning, the original Avengers hold a silent mourning for Romanoff, who sacrificed herself to obtain the [[Soul Stone]]. After Banner restores the lives Thanos erased, an alternate version of Thanos from 2014 travels through the Quantum Tunnel and attacks the Avengers Compound. Thor, Stark and Rogers confront and battle Thanos. After the restored Avengers, Guardians, Asgardians, [[Ravagers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Ravagers]], [[Masters of the Mystic Arts (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Masters of the Mystic Arts]] and the Wakandan army arrive, Thor participates in the final battle against Thanos and his army. In the end, Stark sacrifices himself to kill Thanos and his forces. Afterward, Thor attends Stark's funeral. While Rogers returns the alternate Stones and Mjolnir to their respective timelines, Thor returns to New Asgard, where he makes Valkyrie the new ruler and leaves with the Guardians of the Galaxy into space.\n\n=== Fighting Gorr the God Butcher ===\n{{further|Thor: Love and Thunder}}\nAfter spending a period of time with the Guardians of the Galaxy and reattaining his muscular physique, Thor parts ways with them to respond to a distress signal from [[Sif (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Sif]]. Upon arrival, a beaten Sif warns Thor of [[Gorr (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Gorr]], a being possessing the god-killing weapon, the Necrosword, seeking the extinction of all gods and that his next target is New Asgard. \n\nDr. [[Jane Foster (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Jane Foster]], Thor's ex-girlfriend who is diagnosed with [[terminal cancer]] arrives at New Asgard in hopes of seeking [[Cancer treatment|medical treatment]]. Thor's destroyed hammer [[Mjolnir (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Mjolnir]] re-forges and bonds itself to Foster, granting her its power after years earlier Thor had unknowingly enchanted it to protect her. Thor arrives in New Asgard just as Gorr starts attacking the town with shadow creatures. He is surprised to find Foster with Mjolnir but nevertheless teams up with her, Valkyrie and Korg to fight Gorr. The group thwarts Gorr, but he escapes, kidnapping several Asgardian children.\n\nThe group travels to Omnipotent City to warn the other gods and ask for their help. The Olympian god [[Zeus (Marvel Comics)|Zeus]] is unwilling to help and has Thor captured, forcing the group to fight off Zeus's men. Zeus injures Korg; in anger, Thor impales Zeus with his own thunderbolt, which Valkyrie steals during their escape. They then travel to the Shadow Realm to save the children. However, this turned out to be a ruse for Gorr to take Stormbreaker, which he intends to use on the Bifrost to enter [[Eternity (comics)|Eternity]] and ask for the destruction of all gods. Gorr manages to overpower Thor's group and successfully steal Stormbreaker. Gorr uses Stormbreaker to open the portal to Eternity. Valkyrie is badly injured and Foster ends the battle drained by her use of Mjolnir, which has exacerbated her cancer. Thor goes alone, using Zeus's thunderbolt to imbue the kidnapped Asgardian children with his power to fight alongside him. Foster arrives and joins Thor in fighting Gorr and destroys the Necrosword.\n\nAdmitting defeat, Thor manages to convince Gorr that all he wanted from Eternity was not to destroy the gods but to get his daughter back. Foster succumbs to her illness and dies in Thor's arms. Eternity allows Gorr's request to revive Love,  and he asks Thor to take care of before he dies. The children return to New Asgard, where Valkyrie and Sif begin training them. Meanwhile, Thor, now once again in possession of Mjolnir, continues to go on adventures to help people, with Love, now wielding Stormbreaker, by his side.\n\n==Alternate versions==\n\n===Losing the Tesseract===\n{{See also|Avengers: Endgame|Glorious Purpose}}\n\nIn an alternate 2012, Thor and the Avengers are victorious over Loki during the Battle of New York. However, when the time travelling Tony Stark and Scott Lang from 2023 arrive to steal the Tesseract, they alter 2012-Thor's history when they cause 2012-Stark to have a [[cardiac dysrhythmia]]. 2012-Thor uses Mjolnir to save 2012-Stark's life, but the incident inadvertently causes Loki to gain access to the Tesseract which he uses to escape by [[Loki (TV series)|teleporting away]], leaving 2012-Thor with concern and confusion.\n===Throg===\n{{See also|Loki (TV series)}}\n{{Further|Journey into Mystery (Loki)}}\n\nIn an alternate reality, Thor (voiced by [[Chris Hemsworth]])<ref>{{Cite web |last=Nelson |first=Jeff |date=July 10, 2021 |title=Chris Hemsworth's Loki Cameo As Frog Thor Revealed By Director |url=https://screenrant.com/loki-show-chris-hemsworth-cameo-frog-thor-details/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210710201947/https://screenrant.com/loki-show-chris-hemsworth-cameo-frog-thor-details/ |archive-date=July 10, 2021 |access-date=July 10, 2021 |website=[[Screen Rant]]}}</ref> is turned into a frog and is later sent to the [[Features of the Marvel Cinematic Universe#Void|Void]] by the [[Time Variance Authority (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Time Variance Authority]] (TVA). This version is dubbed \"[[Throg]]\".\n\n===''What If...?''===\n{{See also|What If...? (TV series)}}\n\nSeveral [[parallel universes in fiction|alternate versions]] of Thor appear in the animated series ''What If...?'', with Hemsworth reprising his role.\n\n====Death of the Avengers====\n{{Further|What If... the World Lost Its Mightiest Heroes?}}\nIn an alternate 2011, while seeking Mjolnir at a S.H.I.E.L.D. base following his banishment from Asgard, Thor is seemingly shot dead by [[Clint Barton (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Clint Barton]] by accident, though it is later revealed that his death was orchestrated by a vengeful [[Hank Pym (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Hank Pym]] in his Yellowjacket alias.\n\n====Party Prince====\n{{Further|What If... Thor Were an Only Child?|What If... the Watcher Broke His Oath?}}\nIn another alternate 2011, Thor is raised as an only child due to Odin giving an infant Loki back to Laufey and grows up to be a boisterous prince who prefers spending his time partying. While Odin falls into the Odinsleep and Frigga visits her sisters, Thor hosts a large intergalactic party on Earth in [[Las Vegas]], with attendees including [[Loki (Marvel Cinematic Universe)#Frost Giant prince|a version of Loki]] who is a Prince of the Frost Giants and good friends with Thor, the Sovereign, the Ravagers, Surtur, Korg, Nebula, Drax, the Grandmaster, and Howard the Duck. In response, S.H.I.E.L.D. Acting Director [[Maria Hill (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Maria Hill]] summons Danvers for assistance, but Thor refuses to leave and the two engage in a battle. Thor subdues Danvers and continues partying with his fellow alien partygoers, destroying human relics and locations such as [[Stonehenge]] and the [[Statue of Liberty]]. Thor also meets Foster and establishes a romantic relationship with her. While he is partying, she contacts Frigga to discipline Thor before he kills danvers and does more damage. Thor is alerted to Frigga's impending arrival and intimidates his partygoers to clean up the damage they caused when he mentions that Frigga is coming. They succeed in undoing the damages. Frigga arrives to find him studying with his fellow Asgardians and the Midgardians. When he calls forth Mjolnir, he finds it defaced as Frigga shakes her head. Afterward, Thor visits Foster at her van and invites her on a date, only to be interrupted by an [[Ultron (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Ultron]] from another universe wielding the [[Infinity Stones]]. \n\nAs he then fights off the Ultron Sentries, he is recruited by the [[Watcher (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Watcher]] into the [[Guardians of the Multiverse]] to defeat Ultron. While in another universe, Thor accidentally alerts Ultron to their presence prematurely, and are transported to Ultron's home universe following a brief battle. Joined by [[Natasha Romanoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Natasha Romanoff]], the team fights Ultron and manage to defeat him, and Thor returns to his home reality and reunites with Foster.\n\n====Ultron's conquest====\n{{Further|What If... Ultron Won?}}\nIn an alternate 2015, Thor, along with Stark, Rogers, and Banner, are killed by [[Ultron (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Ultron]] who had successfully uploaded his consciousness into a new Vibranium body.\n\n==Differences from the comic books==\nA major divergence from the comic books is the absence of Thor's comic book alter ego, Donald Blake,<ref name=\"Bath\">{{cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/things-wrong-thor-everyone-chooses-ignore/|title=20 Things Wrong With Thor Everyone Chooses To Ignore|first=Dave|last=Bath|publisher=[[Screen Rant]]|date=October 28, 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"Bacon\">{{cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/marvel-movies-not-adapt-comics/|title=The MCU Isn't Pretending To Adapt Marvel Comics Stories Any More|first=Thomas|last=Bacon|publisher=[[Screen Rant]]|date=August 28, 2018}}</ref> although he uses the name 'Donald Blake' as a [[pseudonym]] during his time on Earth in ''Thor'', an [[Easter egg (media)|Easter egg]] homage to the comics.<ref name=\"Donald Blake\" /> In the comics, as in the MCU, Odin stripped Thor of his powers and sent him to Earth as punishment for Thor's arrogance and intemperance. However, in the comics, Odin puts Thor into the body of Donald Blake, a crippled human doctor, for the course of a long-running storyline, encompassing years of adventures during which Thor's alter ego is occasionally able to cause Thor to re-emerge to fight villainy. In the MCU, with no element of an alter ego, this banishment is resolved within the first film, over the course of days.<ref name=\"Bath\"/> The lack of an alter ego also impacts Thor's relationships. In the comics, Thor's love interest, Jane Foster, is an assistant to Donald Blake. In the films, she has no prior connection to the character, and meets him due to her work as a physicist studying the type of phenomena his appearances generate.<ref name=\"Bath\"/>\n\nAnother significant difference from the comic books is the destruction of Thor's hammer, Mj\u00f6lnir, in the MCU and the origin of its replacement, Stormbreaker. In the comics, Stormbreaker is created by the dwarf Eitri by Odin's decree, to be given to the character [[Beta Ray Bill]], after Bill fights Thor in hand-to-hand combat to determine who should possess Mj\u00f6lnir. In the MCU, Thor himself assists Eitri in creating Stormbreaker as a replacement for the destroyed Mj\u00f6lnir, to use as a weapon with which to face Thanos,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/thors-stormbreaker-facts-hammer-left-out-infinity-war/|title=Thor's Stormbreaker: Facts About The Hammer They Don't Cover In Infinity War|website=[[Screen Rant]]|first=Rose|last=Moore|date=March 3, 2019}}</ref> though he does later retrieve Mj\u00f6lnir for a brief period while travelling through time.\n\nAt the end of ''Avengers: Endgame'', Thor joins the Guardians of the Galaxy, also a different course from anything that occurs in the comic books.\n\n==Reception==\n[[File:SDCC 15 - Thor (19671916312).jpg|thumb|''[[Cosplayer]]'' portraying Chris Hemsworth's Thor at the 2016 ''[[San Diego Comic-Con]]'']]\nWhile Hemsworth's portrayal of the character has received praise, Thor, as a character, was initially less well-received than other Avengers characters, and it has been stated that \"before ''Ragnarok'', Thor was described by some as an ill-defined if likable meathead of a character, used primarily for punching and occasionally fish-out-of-water jokes made at his expense\",<ref name=\"Moran\">{{cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/thor-ragnarok-saved-franchise/|title=Ragnarok Truly Did Save The Thor Franchise|website=[[Screen Rant]]|first=Sarah|last=Moran|date=September 1, 2018}}</ref> and that films featuring the character were \"the studio's least fun franchise\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/10/26/16537186/thor-ragnarok-review|title=Thor: Ragnarok finally makes Thor a hero worth rooting for|publisher=Vox.com|first=Alex|last=Abad-Santosalex|date=November 2, 2017}}</ref> In particular, ''The Dark World'' was criticized for adding \"absolutely zero development or growth for its main character\", resulting in \"little enthusiasm for Thor from either audiences or Marvel\".<ref name=\"Moran\"/> ''Thor: Ragnarok'', however, was much better received, to the extent that it has widely been described as saving the ''Thor'' franchise.<ref name=\"Moran\"/> In his review of ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'', [[Joe Morgenstern]] of ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' acknowledged \"Chris Hemsworth's Thor, endearing despite some ragged material and the actor's seemingly limited dramatic range\".<ref name=\"MorgensternEndgame\">{{cite journal|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/avengers-endgame-review-a-marvelous-wrap-11556124677|title='Avengers: Endgame' Review: A Marvelous Wrap|last=Morgenstern|first=Joe|journal=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=April 25, 2019|access-date=June 3, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190603163507/https://www.wsj.com/articles/avengers-endgame-review-a-marvelous-wrap-11556124677|archive-date=June 3, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===''Avengers: Infinity War''===\nThor in infinity war was widely praised, for its themes signifying his losses, his journey as a God and his sacrifice for the people of earth and Asgard.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://uk.movies.yahoo.com/amphtml/avengers-infinity-war-spoilers-took-19-films-thor-now-marvels-mvp-190137859.html |title= Avengers Infinity War \"SPOILERS\" It took 19 films; Thor is Marvel s MVP|website=uk.movies|date=April 28, 2018|access-date=September 13, 2022}}</ref> Mike Reyes of Cinema blend stated \"The quest itself is Thor's way of trying to build himself back up after the most devastating losses, and Hemsworth is most certainly game for that.

After losing everything, Thor is severely desperate to get back in the saddle and be a hero again, only this time it's not out of youthful impulse. Paying close attention to his conversation with Rocket, you can see a bit more of the age and wisdom in his person, particularly due to the fact that Chris Hemsworth seems to have adopted more of the tone and mannerisms of Anthony Hopkins' Odin.

In a bid to destroy the Black Winter, Galactus turns Thor into his Herald of Thunder, who will find five particular worlds that Galactus must consume to gain the power to oppose the Black Winter. The transformation into a Herald also restores Thor's lost eye and arm.<ref name=\"Thor vol6 no1\">''Thor'' vol.6 #1</ref> Thor later learns that the Black Winter considers Galactus as his herald.

After the battle, he sends Mjolnir to Broxton, Oklahoma, where Asgard was once built and later on destroyed. There, a man named Adam Aziz visits the crash site first. He notices that \"Call Tony Stark\" is written, along with his phone number (which was Thor's revenge for the \"Nice throw\" Iron Man had previously written on Thor's Hammer<ref name=\"Thor vol6 no1\" />), and calls Tony. When Iron Man comes, both him and Adam see that writing on Mjolnir has changed to \"Pick it up\". Adam picks up the hammer, and his clothes change to more Asgardian like, with a cape and a helmet.<ref>''Thor'' vol.6 #7</ref> Thor soon comes to Broxton, and takes Mjolnir from Adam, but Iron Man snatches it, refusing to return it to Thor until he had run some tests on the hammer and until Thor had answered some questions. Thor replies that he does not answer to anyone, to which Iron Man hit Thor on the face with the hammer. Thor threatens Iron Man, who promptly gives the hammer back. Thor explains to Iron Man that while the hammer has been growing heavier for him, it has been becoming lighter for others. Iron Man promises that he will not tell anyone and goes. Thor goes to Asgard after briefly teaching Adam how to fly using Mjolnir.<ref>''Thor'' vol.6 #8</ref>\n\nIn the 2020 ''Avengers'' \"Enter the Phoenix\" story-arc, it is alluded that Thor is the son of a mutant avatar of the Phoenix Force known as [[Phoenix Force (comics)#Lady Phoenix|Lady Phoenix]], who had an affair with Odin 1,000,000 years prior at the dawn of man.<ref>''Avengers'' Vol. 8 #40-43 (December 2020-March 2021)</ref> However, in a later story in Thor's own comic book, he once again drew upon powers over the Earth inherited by Gaea, as had repeatedly been established earlier, so the veracity of these claims remain very uncertain.<ref name=\"Gaea\" />\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nLike all Asgardians, Thor is incredibly long-lived and relies upon periodic consumption of the Golden Apples of [[Idunn (Marvel Comics)|Idunn]] to sustain his extended lifespan, which to date has lasted many [[millennia]].

Thor has all the qualifications needed to be the greatest Avenger of them all. His godly powers make him one of the strongest heroes on Earth. Mighty is his Mjolnir. He's saved the planet form Frost Giants, trickster gods, alien invaders, and just about any other threat you can think off. But what ultimately sets Thor apart from so many other gods and heroes is his innate humanity. Ages ago he was nothing but a foolish, headstrong boy, but his time spent trapped in the body of feeble Dr. Donald Blake taught Thor a valuable and lasting lesson about humility. Now, there's no question that Thor numbers among the greatest of Earth's heroes. No Avenger is more brave, noble, or quick to place himself in harm's way for the good of humanity \".<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.ign.com/top/avengers/1|date=April 30, 2012|title=The Top 50 Avengers |publisher=IGN|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20151003175228/http://www.ign.com/top/avengers/1|archive-date= October 3, 2015|url-status= live|access-date=July 28, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Other versions==\n{{Main|Alternative versions of Thor (Marvel Comics)}}\n\n==In other media==\n{{Main|Thor (Marvel Comics) in other media|Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)}}\nThe character was first portrayed in live action by [[Eric Allan Kramer]] in the 1988 television movie ''[[The Incredible Hulk Returns]]''.
