He is a \"Pluskommander\"\u2014described by him as being equivalent to [[Captain (naval)|captain]]\u2014in the Kree's interstellar fleet, the Kree Void Navy. Mahr Vehl is also a member of the Halason family, who according to Kree religion are God's chosen. Mahr Vehl denies this view and insists that his ancestor, Hala, was not a God\u2014rather simply a man who believed that all that innocent life was worth saving. Initially a spy sent to Earth in an attempt to prevent humans from developing interstellar travel, Mahr Vehl abandons his mission and adopts the identity of physicist Dr. Philip Lawson. Under this guise, Mahr Vehl aids the human scientists in the development of an interstellar engineering program at a secret [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] installation in [[New Mexico]].<ref>''Ultimate Secret'' #2</ref>\n\nWhen the Kree attack the installation, Mahr Vehl is forced to reveal himself and battle the attackers. Although able to successfully defend the installation, Mahr Vehl is rendered unconscious and is eventually questioned by [[Nick Fury]]. Mahr Vehl explains he is a member of the Kree himself, and that they have been observing [[Earth]] to determine if humanity poses a threat to the Kree in the larger [[galaxy]].<ref>''Ultimate Secret'' #2</ref> Observing mankind's violent nature, Mahr Vehl reveals that the Kree have decided to confine humanity on Earth until the entity [[Gah Lak Tus]] can destroy them, ending the potential threat.<ref>''Ultimate Secret'' #4</ref>\n\nAnother Kree force attacks the installation soon after, but is stopped by a combined team of superheroes. Another team of heroes\u2014with Mahr Vehl's aid\u2014storm the Kree ship while the aliens are on Earth. The commander, [[Yon-Rogg|Yahn Rgg]], activates the self-destruct mechanism, but not before Mahr Vehl hacks into the ship's database and downloads its contents into his memory banks.<ref>''Ultimate Secret'' #1-4 (March 2005-Oct. 2005)</ref> Mahr Vehl later aids the heroes against the \"heralds\" of Gah Lak Tus, the [[Silver Surfer#Ultimate Silver Surfer|Silver Surfers]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Webber |first=Tim |date=2018-07-22 |title=Every Captain Marvel Ever, Officially Ranked |url=https://www.cbr.com/every-captain-marvel-ranked/ |access-date=2022-10-08 |website=CBR |language=en-US}}</ref> Mahr Vehl is wounded in battle, but this diversionary action gives [[Mr. Fantastic#Ultimate Mr. Fantastic|Ultimate Mr. Fantastic]] time to use the [[Ultimate Nullifier]], which repels Gah Lak Tus.

The Kree also have extended, four fingered hands, underarm webbing, and four toed, bird-like feet. Kree are also unable to speak terran languages without surgical modification to their throats. In human form, Mahr Vehl appears to be of average height with black hair and green eyes.\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nMahr Vehl's body has been implanted with a green and white cybernetic battle suit that can be activated by a device located on his wrist (which takes the appearance of a wristwatch when he is in human form). The battlesuit flares with bio-electric energy and provides Mahr Vehl with increased strength, increased healing, speed, flight, invisibility, phasing, the ability to view the entire light spectrum, the capability to create energy shields, and the power to project energy blasts via the ''totalkannon'' on his left forearm.<ref>''Ultimate Secret'' #1</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Harn |first=Darby |date=2021-05-05 |title=15 Most Powerful Versions Of Captain Marvel From The Comics |url=https://screenrant.com/captain-marvel-most-powerful-comic-book-incarnations/ |access-date=2022-10-08 |website=ScreenRant |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Connolly |first=Spencer |date=2022-04-24 |title=Captain Marvel's Ultimate Armor Is the Coolest Costume Marvel Forgot |url=https://screenrant.com/captain-marvel-best-costume-armor-powers-ultimate-comics/ |access-date=2022-10-08 |website=ScreenRant |language=en-US}}</ref> In later appearances Vehl's armor suit shows other special capabilities such as shape shifting and armor expansion, causing him to bulk up into a larger, stronger physical form along with greater energy projection fired from both arms instead of just the armor control dial.<ref>''Ultimate Mystery'' #2-4</ref> As well as project massive gunnery capable of dealing damage to the Gah Lak Tus swarm drones.<ref>''Hunger'' #3-4</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\n\n=== Accolades ===\n\n* In 2018, ''[[CBR.com]]'' ranked Mahr Vehl 11th in their \"Every Captain Marvel Ever\" list.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Webber |first=Tim |date=2018-07-22 |title=Every Captain Marvel Ever, Officially Ranked |url=https://www.cbr.com/every-captain-marvel-ranked/ |access-date=2022-10-08 |website=CBR |language=en-US}}</ref>\n* In 2019, ''[[CBR.com]]'' ranked Mahr Vehl 8th in their \"Every Version Of Captain Marvel\" list.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Lealos |first=Shawn S. |date=2019-03-30 |title=Ranked: Every Version Of Captain Marvel |url=https://www.cbr.com/captain-marvel-all-versions-ranked/ |access-date=2022-10-08 |website=CBR |language=en-US}}</ref>\n* In 2022, ''[[Screen Rant]]'' included Mahr Vehl in their \"15 Most Powerful Versions Of Captain Marvel From The Comics\" list.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Harn |first=Darby |date=2021-05-05 |title=15 Most Powerful Versions Of Captain Marvel From The Comics |url=https://screenrant.com/captain-marvel-most-powerful-comic-book-incarnations/ |access-date=2022-10-08 |website=ScreenRant |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n==In other media==\n\n===Television===\n* In the ''[[Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes]]'' episode \"459\", this Captain Marvel has some aspects of the Ultimate version/Mahr-Vehl, like his full name and rank, powers, human alias, and even appearance. Here, he is portrayed as a blue-skinned Kree rather than his traditional appearance as a \"Pink Kree,\" and uses the human alias \"Philip Lawson.\" He does not have the Nega-Bands, but makes use of highly advanced shape-shifting Kree weaponry. He helps the Avengers save Earth from a Kree Sentry sent to purge it of human life so the Kree can use the planet in their war against the Skrulls. He is distrusted by the team, particularly the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]], due to him being a Kree, but nearly sacrifices himself to take the robot's bomb into space and save earth. Afterwards he leaves to plead with the Supreme Intelligence to spare Earth, though he warns that the Kree will try to take Earth again. As he returns in \"Welcome to the Kree Empire\", He is accommodated by superiors commander [[Yon-Rogg]] and the Kree Grand Accuser [[Ronan the Accuser|Ronan]] who had been tasked by the Supremor to judge whether Earth's citizens were fit to join the empire. They were soon met with resistance by [[S.W.O.R.D. (comics)|S.W.O.R.D]] and its newest agent [[Carol Danvers|Ms. Marvel]], an associate of Mar-Vell's from when he went by his Lawson identity; exposure from his Kree Navy battle gear had augmented her genetic structure giving Carol cosmic superpowers. Mar-Vell begged her and the rest of earths heroes as well as its people to surrender peacefully, only to be violently rebuked, this defiance sending Ronan and the rest of his soldiers on the warpath. In a desperate attempt to stop all hostilities at the U.N. site, Captain Marvel intercepts a blast exchange between Ms. Marvel and Ronan; begging one last time for Earth to surrender to the Kree in order to spare mankind the galactic emperium's wrath. After Ronan is defeated Marvel and the rest of the invading Kree forces are imprisoned within Prison 42, an extra-dimensional prison in the [[Negative Zone]]. He warns that the Kree Empire will now come in full force after having humiliated the planets would be conquerors, but Iron Man retorts that they'll be waiting. He is voiced by [[Roger Craig Smith]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=2014-02-27 |title=Captain Marvel Costume History |url=https://www.themarysue.com/agent-of-s-t-y-l-e-marvels-captain-marvels-part-two/ |access-date=2022-10-08 |website=The Mary Sue |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=CAPTAIN MARVEL VOICE |url=https://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/tv-shows/The-Avengers-Earths-Mightiest-Heroes/Captain-Marvel/ |website=Behind The Voice Actors}}</ref>\n\n===Video games===\n* Mahr Vehl appears as an alternate costume (labeled as \"Ultimate\") for the [[PlayStation Portable|PSP]] exclusive character [[Genis-Vell]] in ''[[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance]]''.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://marvel.com/universe/Mahr_Vehl_%28Ultimate%29 Ultimate Mahr Vehl] at the Marvel Universe\n* {{comicbookdb|type=character|id=3361|title=Mahr Vehl}}\n* {{Marveldatabase}}\n\n{{Ultimate Marvel}}\n{{Captain Marvel (Marvel Comics)}}\n{{S.H.I.E.L.D.}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:MahrVehl}}\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 2005]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from parallel universes]]\n[[Category:Fictional military captains]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics aliens]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics extraterrestrial superheroes]]\n[[Category:Ultimate Marvel characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters who can turn invisible]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters with superhuman strength]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Warren Ellis]]\n[[Category:S.H.I.E.L.D. agents]]\n[[Category:Kree]]"}]}}}}
