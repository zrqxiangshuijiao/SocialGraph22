Palmer]], who was himself quite short.) After stumbling onto a mass of [[white dwarf star]] matter that had fallen to Earth, he fashioned a [[lens (optics)|lens]] which allowed him to shrink down to subatomic size. Originally, his size and molecular density abilities derived from the white dwarf star material of his costume, controlled by mechanisms in his belt, and later by controls in the palms of his gloves. Much later, he gained the innate equivalent powers within his own body. After the events of ''[[Identity Crisis (DC Comics)|Identity Crisis]],'' Ray shrank himself to microscopic size and disappeared. Finding him became a major theme of the '''[[Countdown to Final Crisis|Countdown]]''' year-long series and crossover event.<ref name=\"dc-ency\"/>\n\n===Paul Hoben===\nPrior to Ray Palmer's trip to the [[Amazon Rainforest|Amazon Jungle]], he learns his wife [[Jean Loring]] has had an affair with her colleague, Paul Hoben. Palmer and Loring got a divorce. Later, Palmer offers his blessing to the couple when they marry, and he offers Hoben his size-changing belt so that Hoben can protect [[Ivy Town]] after Ray returns to the [[List of hidden races in DC Comics#M|Morlaidhans]]. Adam Cray would later steal this belt; Hoben never uses the costume or name of the Atom.\n\n===Adam Cray===\n<!-- This section is linked from [[List of DC Comics characters: A]] -->\n[[File:SuicideSquad46.jpg|thumb|125px|left|Adam Cray, ''Suicide Squad'' #46.]]\n\n'''Adam Cray''', son of the murdered Senator Joseph Cray, first appeared as the Atom in the pages of ''[[Suicide Squad]]'' #44 by [[John Ostrander]] (August 1990). Cray was initially believed to be Ray Palmer in disguise by members of the team. Cray had been recruited by Palmer (who faked his own death) to apprehend the Micro Squad, a group of villains that had been reduced in size. Palmer intended to use Cray to uncover a shadowy government cabal which was using Palmer to discover the secret identities of other costumed heroes (Palmer's own identity no longer being secret). While Palmer infiltrated the Micro Squad, Cray would attract the attention of the Cabal as the new Atom so that no one would notice Palmer assuming the identity of a fallen Micro Squad member.\n\nAdam Cray remained with the Suicide Squad briefly, serving as a secret weapon whose existence was unknown to others of the Squad. Cray saves Amanda Waller from a group of assassins. At one point, Cray approaches [[Deadshot]] about his role in Senator Cray's murder. Later, Cray is impaled through the chest with a screw by Blacksnake, a Micro Squad member who believes him to be Palmer.\n\nAfter the unanticipated murder of Cray, Palmer reveals himself and defeats Cray's murderer. The ruse ended, Palmer explains himself to the Justice League, who had been searching for him after hearing rumors of a new Atom.\n\nDuring the events of ''[[Blackest Night]]'', Adam's corpse is reanimated as a member of the [[Black Lantern Corps]] alongside several other fallen Suicide Squad members.<ref>''Suicide Squad'' #67 (January 2010)</ref> Following his reanimation, Adam and the other Black Lanterns travel to Belle Reve and attack [[Bane (comics)|Bane]] and [[Black Alice (comics)|Black Alice]].<ref>''Secret Six'' vol. 3 #17 (January 2010)</ref> Adam is apparently destroyed by the [[Manhunters (DC Comics)|Manhunter]]'s self-destruct mechanism, unleashing an explosion of [[Green Lantern]] energy that eradicates the Black Lanterns.<ref>''Secret Six'' vol. 3 #18 (February 2010)</ref>\n\nIn [[DC Rebirth]], Adam Cray is the son of Senator Cray and Ryan Choi's roommate at Ivy University. Senator Cray also attended Ivy and expected Adam to attend Ivy as well. He first meets Ryan when he walks into their dorm with heavy luggage and kindly introduces himself. Adam teaches Ryan how to play rugby and video games.<ref>''Justice League of America: The Atom Rebirth'' #1</ref>\n\n===Ryan Choi===<!-- This section is linked from [[List of DC Comics characters: A]] -->\n{{Main|Atom (Ryan Choi)}}\n'''Ryan Choi''', as described by DC solicitations, is \"a young hotshot professor who's filling the extra spot on Ivy University's teaching staff. .. and who inadvertently ends up filling the old Atom's super-heroic shoes\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dccomics.com/comics/?cm=5536 |title=DC Comics |publisher=DC Comics |date=2010-04-21 |access-date=2011-01-15}}</ref> This new Atom is based on a redesign by [[Grant Morrison]].

She is noted to be \"the most important member of the Justice League of America\" by Steve Trevor.<ref>''Justice League'' vol. 2 #20 (July 2013)</ref> At the conclusion of the \"[[Trinity War]]\" storyline, she is revealed to in fact be betraying both teams; she hails from the alternate universe of [[Earth-3]], where she is a member of the [[Crime Syndicate of America#The New 52|Crime Syndicate]] operating under the name Atomica. She also reveals that by placing a sliver of Green Kryptonite in Superman's optic nerve, she caused him to accidentally kill [[Doctor Light (Arthur Light)|Doctor Light]], with the added effect of severely weakening and almost killing Superman over time.<ref>''Justice League'' vol. 2 #23</ref>\n\nAtomica originally worked on Earth-3 with [[Johnny Quick]] as a thief and killer. One night after killing two cops, they are cornered on the roof of [[S.T.A.R. Labs]] during a storm. Lightning hits a satellite, electrocuting Johnny and granting him speed powers.

When the singularity threatened to expand and destroy his universe, he enters it in an attempt to save the universe but instead finds himself on an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|interdimensional bridge]] to another universe as his own is wiped out, unable to stop it. At the end of the bridge, he finds [[Superman (Kal Kent)|Superman Prime]] who came to help but was too late. Stranded, he searches this universe for remnants of the one he lost, in time taking the name the Atom and joining the [[Justice Legion Alpha]] when he helped them defeat the Bizarro-Legion. This Atom's powers differ from his predecessors in that he doesn't shrink but breaks up into several smaller duplicates of himself divided amongst his mass. At atomic size, these duplicates can mimic [[Chemical element|elements]] such as gold and oxygen. <ref>''DC One Million 80-Page Giant'' #1000000</ref>\n\n==Enemies==\n{{expand section|date=April 2020}}\nEach of the versions of Atom have their own enemies:\n\n===Golden Age enemies===\n* [[Black Dragon Society (comics)|Black Dragon Society]] - A Japanese saboteur organization.<ref>''All-Star Comics'' #41.

Thompson was succeeded by his son, who was killed by the Tangent Comics version of the [[Fatal Five]], and a grandson named Adam, who, in ''Tangent: Superman's Reign'', is being held captive by Superman.\n\nIt is suggested in the Tangent series that the Atom's name was at least in part chosen because of the abbreviation of his full name \"Arthur Harrison Thompson\" on his barracks door to simply \"A. Thom.\"\n\nAlso in the Tangent series, the Atom's presence as America's first superhero during the 1960s has led to a huge cultural impact, and in this world many significant points in pop culture have been effected by his presence; for instance [[The Beatles]] choose to be called \"The Atomiks\", further more TV shows such as ''[[The Beverly Hillbillies]]'' became ''The Superman Hillbillies'', ''[[The Dick Van Dyke Show]]'' became ''The Dick Van Hero Show'' and ''[[Get Smart]]'' became ''Get Powers''.\n\n===Elseworlds===\n{{Main|Elseworlds}}\n*Some other re-imaginings of the Atom include an appearance in ''League of Justice'', a story portraying the Justice League in a ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''-type story where the Atom was recast as a wizard/fortune teller called \"Atomus The Palmer\".\n*Al Pratt as the Atom was one of the three heroes who chose to work at the side of Senator Thompson in ''[[The Golden Age (comics)|The Golden Age]]''. When Al discovers that Thompson is really the [[Ultra-Humanite]], he joins the other heroes against the villain and Dyna-Man.\n*The Al Pratt Atom appeared in ''[[JSA: The Unholy Three]]'' as a post-WW2 intelligence agent with transparent atomic flesh and a visible skeleton.\n*''[[JLA: Age of Wonder]]'' where Ray Palmer worked with a science consortium whose numbers at one point included [[Thomas Edison]] and [[Nikola Tesla]].\n*''[[JLA: Created Equal]]'', after Ray Palmer is killed in the cosmic storm that nearly wipes out the rest of the male population on Earth, a graduate student named '''Jill Athron''' is given a research grant to study Palmer's white-dwarf-star-belt.
