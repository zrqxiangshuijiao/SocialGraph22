For reasons unknown, that species died out, and the Bi-Beast is left to his own devices in their city. Years later, the creature sees the [[Betty Ross|Harpy]] with [[Hulk|Bruce Banner]], and is reminded of his former avian masters. The Bi-Beast captures them both and instructs Banner to fix the now-decaying machines in the city. Banner instead chooses to cure the Harpy, who reverts to the form of [[Betty Ross]] soon after.<ref>{{cite book|title=Hulk: The Incredible Guide|last=DeFalco|first=Tom|year=2009|publisher=DK Publishing, Inc.|isbn=978-0-7894-9260-9|page=[https://archive.org/details/hulkincrediblegu0000defa/page/62 62]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/hulkincrediblegu0000defa/page/62}}</ref> The Bi-Beast becomes aware of Banner's deception and fights Banner's alter-ego the [[Hulk]], but is distracted when an [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]] strike force led by [[MODOK]] storms the city. Rather than allow his home to be captured, the Bi-Beast activates a self-destruct mechanism and perishes in the explosion.<ref name=\"Hulk #169 Nov. 1973\">''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #169 (November 1973)</ref>\n\nUnknown to all, a cylinder containing a second Bi-Beast is ejected from the city at the moment of the explosion. The cylinder comes to rest on the ocean floor, and is later retrieved and taken to the [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] [[helicarrier]]. The second Bi-Beast awakens soon after, and imbued with the memories of the first, decides to take control of the helicarrier and launch its missiles at major metropolitan cities, believing the human race to be responsible for the extinction of his creators. General [[Thunderbolt Ross]] becomes aware of the danger and forcibly inserts Bruce Banner into the helicarrier, where he changes into the Hulk and battles the Bi-Beast once more. The two fall mid-battle through an opening activated by S.H.I.E.L.D., and plunge many miles to the ocean. The Bi-Beast disappears and is assumed to have drowned.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #214\u2013216 (August \u2013 October 1977)</ref>\n\nSeveral years later the Bi-Beast reappears. The android captures and enslaves the crews of naval ships and slowly recreates the avian sky-island city and builds an army for another attack on the human race. Donald Blake, however, is traveling on the latest vessel to be attacked (planted there by [[Tony Stark]] \u2013 the alter ego of [[Iron Man]] \u2013 who was aware of Blake's true identity and wanted some added \"insurance\") and becomes [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], who quickly defeats the Bi-Beast and frees the captives.

He teamed up with the Wendigo to use the well's powers to allow them to grow to about thirty feet tall to fight the Hulk.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 631</ref> However, both creatures were easily defeated by Hulk and were imprisoned along with Arm'Cheddon in the Dark Dimension by Umar until Tyrannus and Fin Fang Foom raided the dimension, allowing them to escape in the chaos.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 633</ref>\n\nA Bi-Beast later appears as a member of the [[Sinister Six]]teen.<ref>''The Superior Foes of Spider-Man'' #12</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nThe Bi-Beast is a highly advanced [[Android (robot)|android]] that rivals the Hulk in terms of physical prowess.

Courtesy to one of the Man-Beast's machines, the Bi-Beast have been instilled with pure hate, while the Man-Beast granted himself even greater willpower. A side effect causes reduction in the Bi-Beast's size, (but not mass). He is a brilliant tactician and inventor. For example, he constructed dome cities capable of flight or surviving under the ocean's depth and utilize mind control equipment to [[Brainwashing|brainwash]] humans as his slaves.<ref>''Thor'' #315 (January 1982)</ref> <ref>''Thor #316 (February 1982)</ref>\n\n==In other media==\n===Television===\n* Bi-Beast makes non-speaking appearances in ''[[The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes]]''.{{cn|date=June 2022}} This version was originally imprisoned in the [[Cube (comics)|Cube]] until a technological fault causes the prison to malfunction and allows the prisoners to escape.\n* Bi-Beast appears in ''[[Marvel Disk Wars: The Avengers]]'', voiced by [[Hajime Iijima]] in Japanese and [[Richard Epcar]] in English.{{cn|date=June 2022}}\n\n===Video games===\nBi-Beast appears in ''[[The Incredible Hulk (2008 video game)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' film tie-in game, with the top head voiced by [[Keith Ferguson (voice actor)|Keith Ferguson]] and the bottom head voiced by [[Chris Edgerly]].<ref name=\"Voice\">{{cite web|url=https://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/characters/Hulk/Bi-Beast/|title=Voice of Bi-Beast|website=Behind the Voice Actors|access-date=December 13, 2019|postscript=.
