The Fantastic Four, High Evolutionary, and Gorr were unable to convince Galactus not to destroy Counter-Earth, though Galactus challenged them to find a replacement within 48 hours. Gorr and the [[Human Torch]] found an Earth-like planet, which turned out to be inhabited by [[Skrull]]s. The Skrulls abandoned the planet after an altercation with Gorr, leaving the planet uninhabited and thus worthless to Galactus. Ultimately, the [[Impossible Man]] convinced Galactus to devour his own planet of Poppup instead.
