As in the comics, Loki has generally been a villain in the MCU, variously attempting to conquer [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]] or Earth, and having allied himself with more powerful villains to achieve his aims. He has particular antagonism for his adoptive brother [[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thor]], and is known to variously ally with and then betray Thor and others, and to regularly return from apparent death. In his development through the series, he becomes less of a [[supervillain]] and more of an [[antihero]].\n\n==Concept and creation==\nThe mythical figure [[Loki (Marvel Comics)|Loki]] preceded [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] in making his first Marvel Comics appearance, depicted in the [[science fiction]]/[[fantasy]] [[anthology]] title [[Timely Comics]]' publication ''[[Venus (comic book)|Venus]]'' No. 6 (August 1949) as a member of the [[Olympians (Marvel Comics)|Olympian gods]] exiled to the [[Hades|Underworld]]. However, the current version of Loki made his first official Marvel appearance was in ''[[Journey into Mystery]]'' No. 85 (October 1962), where Loki was reintroduced as Thor's sworn enemy. The modern age Loki was introduced by brothers and co-writers [[Stan Lee]] and [[Larry Lieber]] and he was redesigned by [[Jack Kirby]]. As one of Thor's arch-nemeses, Loki frequently made appearances in Thor-related titles like ''Journey into Mystery'' and ''Thor'', as well as other [[Marvel Universe]] titles such as ''[[Avengers (comic book)|The Avengers]]'' and ''[[X-Men]],''<ref>''X-Men and Alpha Flight'' No. 1 (December 1985)</ref> as well as brief appearances in the ''[[Spider-Man]]'' and ''[[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]]'' comic series.\n\nLive-action film adaptations of characters in the ''Thor'' comic books were proposed at various times, but did not come to fruition. In the mid-2000s, [[Kevin Feige]] realized that Marvel still owned the rights to the core members of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], which included Thor. Feige, a self-professed \"fanboy\", envisioned creating a shared universe just as creators Stan Lee and Jack Kirby had done with their comic books in the early 1960s.<ref name=\"BostonApril2012\">{{cite web|date=April 25, 2012 |last=Russo |first=Tom |title=SUPER GROUP |url=https://www.boston.com/ae/movies/articles/2012/04/29/the_avengers_collects_all_your_favorite_marvel_characters_in_one_handy_wannabe_blockbustersuper_groupthe_avengers_assembles_all_your_favorite_marvel_characters_in_one_handy_wannabe_blockbuster/ |publisher=[[Boston.com]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141028215225/http://www.boston.com/ae/movies/articles/2012/04/29/the_avengers_collects_all_your_favorite_marvel_characters_in_one_handy_wannabe_blockbustersuper_groupthe_avengers_assembles_all_your_favorite_marvel_characters_in_one_handy_wannabe_blockbuster/?page=1 |archive-date=October 28, 2014 |url-status=live  }}</ref> In 2006, the film was announced as a Marvel Studios production.<ref name=\"Carle\">{{cite news|first=Chris |last=Carle |title=Comic-Con 2006: Marvel Announces Three |work=IGN |date=July 3, 2006 |url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/720/720532p1.html |access-date=August 10, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522131009/http://movies.ign.com/articles/720/720532p1.html |archive-date=May 22, 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref> In December 2007, Protosevich described his plans for it \"to be like a [[superhero]] [[origin story]], but not one about a human gaining super powers, but of a god realizing his true potential.

Wen stated that he \"designed Loki's armor to be more overtly ceremonial than practical\", in keeping with the character being more focused on scheming for power than engaging in battle.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.themarysue.com/wacky-loki-design/|title=Loki's First Design in Thor Was Absolutely Wild|first=Kaila|last=Hale-Stern|publisher=[[The Mary Sue]]|date=August 10, 2018}}</ref>\n\nHiddleston described the horns worn as part of his Loki costume as weighing about 30 pounds, resulting in one instance during the filming of ''The Avengers'' where he asked co-star [[Chris Hemsworth]] to really punch him in the face, because the weight of the horns made it difficult to fake being hit.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2480759/that-time-chris-hemworth-punched-tom-hiddleston-in-the-face-filming-the-avengers|title=That Time Chris Hemworth Punched Tom Hiddleston In The Face Filming The Avengers|date=September 23, 2019|website=CINEMABLEND}}</ref>\n\nDuring the ''Loki'' TV series, numerous Loki variants were shown or introduced with varying appearances. With respect to the most prominently featured variant, Sylvie, ''Loki'' costume designer Christine Wada and director Kate Herron planned Sylvie to be \"mysterious and somewhat [[androgyny|androgynous]]\" in the beginning, avoiding her identity reveal to become \"a total play on gender\", rather, letting the character evolve on her own \"as a strong female lead\" without over-sexualization. Sylvie's look represents a character that is \"a fighter\", can stand on her own, and is prepared to engage in battles and runs. Instead of tailor-made armors usually given to female comic book characters to enhance silhouettes, the costume designer intended to not make distinctions between the male and female clothing in the series. Sylvie's costume include a harem drop-crotch pant, which allowed her to emphasize movement equally to a tight pant or a spandex suit. Wada decided to bring that grounded aspect to Sylvie's look into a storyline with magic elements, stating that \"I believe it more that somebody can go fight when they're in a rugged boot more than a pair of high heels... function is such a clear and important thing to reference in all good design.\"<ref>{{Cite magazine|first=Sydney|last=Bucksbaum|url=https://ew.com/movies/costume-designers-evolving-female-comic-book-characters-black-widow-loki/|title=Hair ties and no heels: The evolution of female superhero costumes is finally here|magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=July 16, 2021|access-date=July 16, 2021}}</ref> In her first appearance, Sylvie wore a broken Loki crown, which she later left behind in the Ark.

Odin used magic to make Loki appear Asgardian and raised him as a son alongside Odin's biological son, [[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thor]]. During his upbringing, Odin's wife [[Frigga (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Frigga]] taught Loki how to use magic.\n\nHe used these powers throughout his life, constantly tricking his adoptive brother Thor, as well as pulling a heist on Earth under the alias [[D. B. Cooper]]. He was embittered throughout his upbringing, perceiving that he was neglected by Odin in favor of Thor, and thus grew closer to his adoptive mother Frigga instead.\n\n=== Betrayal of Asgard ===\n{{see|Thor (film)}}\nHundreds of years later, in 2011, Loki watches as Thor prepares to ascend to the throne of [[Asgard (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Asgard]]. This is interrupted by Frost Giants, allowed in to Asgard by Loki, attempting to retrieve an artifact called the Casket, which was captured by Odin in a war centuries before. Loki then manipulates Thor into traveling to Jotunheim against Odin's order to confront Laufey, the Frost Giant leader. A battle ensues until Odin intervenes to save the Asgardians, destroying the fragile truce between the two races. Loki discovers that he is Laufey's biological son, adopted by Odin after the war ended. After Odin exiles Thor to Earth, Loki confronts Odin about his parentage, and a weary Odin falls into the deep \"Odinsleep\" to recover his strength. Loki takes the throne in Odin's stead and offers Laufey the chance to kill Odin and retrieve the Casket. [[Sif (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Sif]] and the [[Warriors Three (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Warriors Three]], unhappy with Loki, attempt to return Thor from exile, convincing [[Heimdall (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Heimdall]], gatekeeper of the [[Bifrost (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Bifr\u00f6st]]\u2014the means of traveling between worlds\u2014to allow them passage to Earth. Aware of their plan, Loki sends the [[Destroyer (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Destroyer]], a seemingly indestructible [[automaton]], to pursue them and kill Thor. The Destroyer leaves Thor on the verge of death but his sacrifice sees him become worthy of returning from exile and he regains his powers and defeats the Destroyer. Afterward, Thor leaves with his fellow Asgardians to confront Loki. In Asgard, Loki betrays and kills Laufey, revealing his true plan to use Laufey's attempt on Odin's life as an excuse to destroy Jotunheim with the Bifr\u00f6st, thus proving himself worthy to Odin. Thor arrives and fights Loki before destroying the Bifr\u00f6st to stop Loki's plan, stranding himself in Asgard. Odin awakens and prevents the brothers from falling into the abyss created in the wake of the bridge's destruction, but after Odin rejects Loki's pleas for approval, Loki allows himself to fall into the abyss.\n\nIn space, Loki encounters the Other, the leader of an extraterrestrial race known as the [[Chitauri (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Chitauri]].

In [[Stuttgart]], Barton steals [[iridium]] needed to stabilize the Tesseract's power while Loki causes a distraction, leading to a brief confrontation with [[Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Steve Rogers]], [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark]], and [[Natasha Romanoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Natasha Romanoff]] that ends with Loki allowing himself to get captured. While Loki is being escorted to S.H.I.E.L.D. on the [[Features of the Marvel Cinematic Universe#Quinjet|Quinjet]], Thor arrives and takes him away, hoping to convince him to abandon his plan. However, Thor eventually takes Loki to S.H.I.E.L.D.'s flying aircraft carrier, the [[Features of the Marvel Cinematic Universe#Helicarriers|Helicarrier]]. Upon arrival, Loki is imprisoned while [[Bruce Banner (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Bruce Banner]] and Stark attempt to locate the Tesseract. Agents possessed by Loki attack the Helicarrier, disabling one of its engines in flight and causing Banner to transform into the Hulk. Thor attempts to stop the Hulk's rampage, and Loki kills the agent [[Phil Coulson]] and ejects Thor from the Helicarrier as he escapes. Loki uses the Tesseract, in conjunction with a device Selvig built, to open a wormhole above [[Features of the Marvel Cinematic Universe#Avengers Tower|Stark Tower]] in [[New York City]] to the Chitauri fleet in space, launching his invasion. The [[Avengers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Avengers]] arrive and rally in defense of the city. As the Chitauri are ultimately defeated, the Hulk attacks Loki and beats him into submission in the Tower, before Loki is arrested and taken to Asgard.\n\nLoki is captured by the Avengers and brought back to Asgard by Thor to be imprisoned for his crimes on Midgard (Earth) using the Tesseract.\n\n=== Battle with the Dark Elves ===\n{{see|Thor: The Dark World}}\nIn 2013, [[Dark Elves (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Dark Elves]] led by [[Malekith (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Malekith]] attack Asgard, searching for [[Jane Foster (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Jane Foster]], whose body has been invaded by an unearthly force known as the Aether. Malekith and his monstrous lieutenant [[Characters of the Marvel Cinematic Universe#Algrim|Kurse]] kill Loki's adoptive mother [[Frigga (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Frigga]], who had taught Loki magic. Thor reluctantly frees Loki, who agrees to take Thor to a secret portal to [[Features of the Marvel Cinematic Universe#Svartalfheim|Svartalfheim]], home of the dark elves, in return for Thor's promise to take vengeance for their mother. In Svartalfheim, Loki appears to betray Thor, in fact tricking Malekith into drawing the Aether out of Jane, but Thor's attempt to destroy the exposed substance fails. Malekith merges with the Aether and leaves in his ship as Loki appears to be fatally wounded saving Thor from Kurse, whom Loki was able to kill through trickery. Thor ultimately defeats Malekith in a battle in [[Greenwich]], and returns to Asgard to decline Odin's offer to take the throne, and tells Odin of Loki's sacrifice. After Thor leaves, it is shown that Loki has actually survived and taken Odin's place on the throne, disguised as Odin.\n\n=== Destruction of Asgard ===\n{{see|Thor: Ragnarok}}\nFrom 2013 to 2017, Loki rules Asgard disguised as Odin, having kept the real Odin under a spell on Earth. During this time, the disguised Loki sends Sif to Earth on a mission and later banishes her from Asgard.\n\nIn 2017, Thor returns to Asgard and discovers Loki's ruse, making Loki reveal himself to the shocked Asgardians. After Loki tells Thor where Odin is, he is taken by Thor back to Earth to New York City. Loki is trapped through a portal by [[Stephen Strange (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Stephen Strange]] as a threat to Earth, before him and Thor are sent into another portal in to [[Norway]], where they find a dying Odin, who explains that his passing will allow his firstborn child, [[Hela (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Hela]], to escape from a prison she was sealed in long ago. Hela appears, destroying Mj\u00f6lnir to Loki's shock, and forces Thor and Loki from the Bifr\u00f6st out into space. Loki lands on the planet [[Sakaar (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Sakaar]], and quickly ingratiates himself to the ruler of that world, the [[Grandmaster (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Grandmaster]]. Thor later crash-lands on Sakaar and is captured by the slave trader [[Valkyrie (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Valkyrie]], a former member of the ancient order of [[Valkyrior|Valkyries]] defeated by Hela. After convincing Valkyrie and Loki to help, they steal a ship with which to escape through a wormhole to Asgard \u2013 but not before Loki again attempts to betray Thor, causing Thor to leave Loki behind on Sakaar. However, Loki is found by [[Korg (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Korg]], [[Miek (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Miek]], and others who join him aboard a large vessel stolen from the Grandmaster called the ''Statesman''. He leads them to return to Asgard and help the Asgardians escape the battle between Thor and Hela's forces, proclaiming himself their savior in the process. During the battle, on Thor's order, Loki goes to Odin's treasure room and places the crown of Surtur in the eternal flame kept there, thus causing an enormous form of [[Surtur (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Surtur]] to appear and destroy Hela and Asgard. In the process of doing so however, he steals the Tesseract from Odin's treasure vault. Thor, crowned king, decides to take the Asgardians to Earth despite Loki's concerns about how he will be received there.\n\n=== Death ===\n{{see|Avengers: Infinity War}}\nWhile en-route to Earth, in 2018, Loki and Thor are intercepted by a large spacecraft carrying [[Thanos (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thanos]] and his [[Children of Thanos (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|children]], alerted to their location by the presence of the Tesseract secretly being held by Loki. After wiping out half of the Asgardians onboard while the rest flee via escape pods, Thanos, wielding the Power Stone, overpowers Thor and Hulk, kills Heimdall, and claims the Space Stone from the Tesseract that Loki hands over to him in order to spare Thor's life. In a last act of self-sacrifice, Loki pretends to swear allegiance to Thanos, only to attempt to stab his throat. Thanos intercepts the attack with one of his infinity stones, and kills Loki by snapping his neck, leaving his body to be cradled in his brother's arms.\n\n== Alternate versions ==\n\n=== 2012 variant ===\n==== Capture and learning original fate ====\n{{See also|Loki (TV series)}}\n{{Further|Avengers: Endgame|Glorious Purpose}}\n[[File:Tom Hiddleston (48468962561) (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|Hiddleston promoting ''Loki'' at the 2019 San Diego Comic-Con]]\nA variant of Loki, dubbed '''Variant L1130''', retrieves the Tesseract in an alternate 2012 during the Avengers' \"Time Heist\" and escapes following the [[Battle of New York (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Battle of New York]], forming a new timeline.

However, TVA agent [[Mobius M. Mobius (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Mobius M. Mobius]] intervenes and takes Loki to a Time Theatre where he reviews Loki's past misdeeds and questions his real motive for hurting people. After realizing that the [[Infinity Stones]] cannot help him, as well as viewing his would-be future on the \"Sacred Timeline\", including his own death at the hand of Thanos, he agrees to help Mobius stop a rogue variant of himself.\n\n==== Working with the Time Variance Authority ====\n{{Further|The Variant}}\nLoki joins a TVA mission following an ambush by the fugitive Loki Variant in 1985 [[Oshkosh, Wisconsin]]. Loki stalls for time, but Mobius understands his plan. After some research, Loki proposes that the Variant is hiding near apocalyptic events like [[Asgard (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Asgard]]'s [[Ragnarok (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Ragnar\u00f6k]], where the impending destruction means their actions cannot change the timeline, thus concealing them from the TVA. Loki and Mobius confirm this possibility by visiting [[Eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD|Pompeii in 79 AD]]. Travelling to 2050 [[Alabama]], they encounter The Variant, who rejects Loki's offer to work together to overthrow the Time-Keepers, before revealing herself as a female variant of Loki. The Variant then uses TVA Reset Charges to \"bomb\" the timeline, creating new timeline branches to keep the organization's minutemen busy, before escaping through a portal to the TVA to assassinate the Time-Keepers, with Loki in pursuit.\n\n==== Allying with Sylvie ====\n{{Further|Lamentis|The Nexus Event}}\nAfter a confrontation at the TVA, Loki teleports the Variant to Lamentis-1, a planet set to be destroyed by a meteor shower, using their TemPad. Both are unable to escape due to the TemPad having run out of power. Agreeing to ally with one another, the Variant introduces herself to Loki by the [[pseudonym|alias]] \"[[Sylvie (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Sylvie]]\" and proposes a truce in order to escape the planet. The pair sneak aboard a train bound for the Ark, a spaceship intended to evacuate Lamentis-1, in order to siphon its power and recharge the TemPad. On the train, Loki gets drunk and starts a ruckus, causing him and Sylvie to be discovered and forced out by the guards. While walking to the Ark in order to instead hijack it and leave the planet, to prevent it from being destroyed as according to the Sacred Timeline, Loki enquires about Sylvie's enchantment ability, learning that the agents of the TVA are variants themselves; Loki reveals to Sylvie that the TVA agents, including Mobius, are not aware that they are variants. With the TemPad broken, the pair fight their way through the guards and through a meteor shower to the Ark, only to witness it being destroyed by a meteor just as they get to it, leaving them stranded.\n\nOn Lamentis-1, Sylvie tells Loki she escaped the TVA when she was about to be arrested as a child. Loki and Sylvie form a romantic bond, creating a branched timeline never seen by the TVA. Mobius rescues the two from Lamentis and has them both arrested, punishing Loki by leaving him in a time loop from his past. After Mobius derides Loki for having fallen in love with Sylvie, Loki tells him that everyone working for the TVA are variants, which Mobius investigates. Now aware of his background upon finding proof, Mobius frees Loki from the loop, but is soon confronted by Renslayer and pruned. Loki and Sylvie are taken to the Time-Keepers, accompanied by Renslayer and her minutemen. Hunter B-15 intervenes, freeing Loki and Sylvie of their time twisting collars, and in the ensuing fight, the minutemen are killed whilst Renslayer is knocked unconscious by Sylvie. Sylvie then beheads one of the Time-Keepers, who turn out to all be androids. Loki prepares to tell Sylvie about his feelings, but Renslayer regains consciousness and prunes him. He awakens in a post-apocalyptic world, dubbed \"the Void\", with multiple other Loki variants, who invite him to join them.\n\n==== Surviving in the Void ====\n{{Further|Journey into Mystery (Loki)|l1=Journey into Mystery}}\nLoki learns from his other variants that a cloud-like creature named Alioth guards the Void and prevents anyone from escaping. Boastful Loki attempts to betray the other Lokis for another Loki variant (who was elected president in his timeline), causing a fight to ensue, forcing Loki and his variant allies to escape. After reuniting with Loki, Sylvie proposes a plan to approach Alioth and enchant it, in hopes that it will lead them to the real mastermind behind the TVA's creation, whilst Mobius teleports back to the TVA. Kid Loki and Reptile Loki escape while Classic Loki creates a large illusion of Asgard to distract Alioth and sacrifices himself in the process. This allows Loki and Sylvie to successfully enchant the creature and move past the Void. Noticing a citadel in the foreground, the pair walk towards it.\n\n==== Meeting He Who Remains ====\n{{Further|For All Time. Always.}}\nIn the Citadel at the End of Time, Loki and Sylvie meet Miss Minutes and reject an offer from her creator, \"[[He Who Remains (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|He Who Remains]]\", to return them to the timeline with everything they desire. He Who Remains reveals to Loki and Sylvie that he created the TVA after ending a multiversal war caused by his variants. As the timeline begins to branch, he offers them a choice: kill him and end the singular timeline, causing another multiversal war, or become his successors in overseeing the TVA. Sylvie decides to kill him, while Loki pleads with her to stop. They kiss, but Sylvie sends Loki back to TVA headquarters. At TVA headquarters, Loki warns B-15 and Mobius about variants of He Who Remains, but they do not recognize him.

While the character first appeared in ''[[Venus (comic book)|Venus]]'' #6 (Aug. 1949), the characterization that has persisted to the modern day, created by writer [[Stan Lee]], scripter [[Larry Lieber]], and penciller [[Jack Kirby]], first appeared in ''[[Journey into Mystery]]'' #85 (Oct. 1962). The character, which is based on the [[Loki|Norse deity of the same name]], is the [[Asgard (comics)|Asgardian]] \"God of Mischief\", the adopted son of [[Odin (Marvel Comics)|Odin]] and the adopted brother of the [[superhero]] [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]. Loki has been portrayed as both a [[supervillain]] and [[antihero]].\n\nLoki has appeared in several ongoing series, [[limited series (comics)|limited series]] and alternate reality series, including the 4-issue series ''Loki'' in 2004 and 2006, being the main character of ''Journey into Mystery'' from issues 622 to 645, appearing in new issues of ''[[Young Avengers]]'' in 2013 and receiving three more solo series, ''Loki: Agent of Asgard'' in 2013, ''[[Vote Loki]]'' in 2016 and ''Loki'' in 2019. The character has also appeared in associated Marvel merchandise including animated television series, films, video games, clothing, and toys.\n\n[[Tom Hiddleston]] plays the [[Loki (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|character]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] films ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]'' (2011), ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'' (2012), ''[[Thor: The Dark World]]'' (2013), ''[[Thor: Ragnarok]]'' (2017), ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'' (2018), and portraying alternate timeline versions of the character in ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'' (2019) and the series ''[[Loki (TV series)|Loki]]'' (2021) and  ''[[What If...?

Also: \"the traditional image of the Devil\"!?|date=June 2018}} Planning to spread hate, he convinced [[Zeus (Marvel Comics)|Jupiter]] to let him travel to the realm of Earth, using [[Venus (Marvel Comics)|Venus]] already being allowed onto it as his justification. Venus pledged herself to Loki's service in order to stop his plans, with Jupiter seeing her unselfish act and freeing her from the pledge, with Loki subsequently being sent back to the Underworld. The modern-age Loki made his first official Marvel appearance in ''[[Journey into Mystery]]'' #85 (Oct. 1962), where Loki was reintroduced as Thor's sworn enemy. The modern age Loki was introduced by brothers and co-writers [[Stan Lee]] and [[Larry Lieber]] and was redesigned by [[Jack Kirby]].\n\nAs one of Thor's arch-nemeses, Loki has frequently made appearances in Thor-related titles like ''Journey into Mystery'' and ''Thor'', as well as other [[Marvel Universe]] titles such as ''[[The Avengers (comic book)|The Avengers]]'' and ''[[X-Men]]''.<ref>''X-Men and Alpha Flight'' #1 (Dec. 1985)</ref> As well as brief appearances in the ''[[Spider-Man]]'' and ''[[Defenders (comics)|The Defenders]]'' comic series, he was the starring character in two four-issue [[miniseries]] ''Loki'' in 2004 and 2010.<ref>{{cite web |author1=Mayerson, Ginger |author2=Poonsombat, Nirut |name-list-style=amp |url=http://liheliso.com/buzz/archive/00000220.htm |title=Interview: Esad Ribi\u0107 |publisher=The Journal of the Lincoln Heights Literary Society Miscellanea and Ephemeron |date=November 9, 2004 |access-date=July 31, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100502034356/http://liheliso.com/buzz/archive/00000220.htm |archive-date=May 2, 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|first=Dave |last=Richards |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=27138 |title=Aguirre-Sacasa Gets Mischievous With \"Loki\" |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |date=July 13, 2010 |access-date=July 31, 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Albert |last=Ching |url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/loki-aguirre-sacasa-100713.html |title=AGUIRRE-SACASA Details LOKI's Origin in October |publisher=[[Newsarama]] |date=July 13, 2010 |access-date=September 27, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100716173604/http://www.newsarama.com/comics/loki-aguirre-sacasa-100713.html |archive-date=July 16, 2010 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nLoki played a key role in the 2010s company-wide ''[[Siege (comics)|Siege]]'' storyline, in which the character is eventually killed.\n\nStarting with issue #622 the ongoing series ''Thor'' reverted to the original title ''Journey into Mystery'' and shifted focus to Loki.

The sorcerer caught him unaware, turning Bor into snow. Bor's son, [[Odin (Marvel Comics)|Odin]], found his father as he was blowing away; Bor begged Odin to find a sorcerer to free him, but Odin made no attempt to save his father. Bor cursed Odin saying that he would take in the son of a fallen king and raise it as his own. Not a week later, Odin himself led the [[Asgard (comics)|Asgardians]] into battle against the Frost Giants and killed [[Laufey (comics)|Laufey]], who was the King, in personal combat. After slaying Laufey, Odin found a small Asgardian-sized child hidden within the primary stronghold of the Frost Giants. The child was Loki; Laufey having kept him hidden from the Frost Giant people due to his shame over his son's small size. Odin took the child, out of a combination of pity, to appease the memory of his father, and because he was the child of a worthy adversary slain in honorable combat, and raised as his own alongside his biological son [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]].<ref>''Thor'' vol. 3 #7\u20138 (May, June 2008)</ref>\n\nThroughout his childhood and into adolescence, Loki was resentful of the differences between how Thor and himself were treated by the citizens of Asgard.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Marvel Studios Visual Dictionary|last=Bray|first=Adam|publisher=Marvel|year=2018|isbn=9781465476371|location=New York, New York|pages=70}}</ref> The Asgardians valued great strength, tenacity, and bravery in battle above all things, and Loki was clearly inferior to his brother Thor in those areas. What he lacked in size and strength, however, he made up for in power and skill, particularly as a [[Magic (supernatural)|sorcerer]]. As Loki grew to adulthood, his natural talent for causing mischief would make itself manifest and earned him a nickname as the \"God of Mischief\"; his mischievousness eventually became malice as his hunger for power and revenge grew stronger. Several times he tried to use tricks to get rid of Thor, such as telling him to guard a hole in the wall that he himself had made. In time, his reputation grew from being a playful and mischievous [[trickster]] to the \"God of [[Evil]]\". Over the centuries, Loki attempted on many occasions to seize the rulership of Asgard and to destroy Thor, even helping the Storm Giant Ghan to escape Thor planning to get a debt from him later, and aided other enemies of Asgard, planning to take over. Odin, who had grown weary of Loki's mischief, magically imprisoned him within a tree until someone would shed a tear for his plight. Loki eventually freed himself by causing a leaf to strike [[Heimdall (comics)|Heimdall]], the guardian of [[Bifrost]], in the eye, which made him shed a tear. Loki compiled an extensive criminal record in Asgard, and was frequently exiled.<ref>[[Matt Fraction]] (w), [[Patrick Zircher]] (p), ''Thor: Ages of Thunder'' #1 (April 30, 2008), [[New York, NY]]: [[Marvel Comics]]</ref> He later met the Sorcerer Eldred, who taught him [[black magic]], repaying Eldred by later giving him to the Fire demon [[Surtur (Marvel Comics)|Surtur]].\n\n===Battles with Earth's heroes===\nLoki's schemes eventually came to include [[Earth]] itself, and often fought with Earth's superhuman heroes to take their planet, and often Asgard itself. He first battled Thor on Earth in modern times after escaping from the tree;<ref name=\"jim85\">''Journey into Mystery'' #85 (Oct. 1962)</ref> Loki then manipulated the [[Hulk]] into wreaking havoc using an illusion of dynamite on train tracks, while in astral form in an attempt to lure Thor to Earth, which inadvertently led to the formation of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] as several other heroes came to meet the Hulk.<ref name=\"avengers1\">''The Avengers'' #1 (Sept. 1963)</ref>\n\nThor was one of the founding members of this superhuman team, and often led them into battle against Loki. Several times Loki, while not directly battling Thor, caused other threats for Thor to battle, like increasing the mental powers of a carnival fortune teller Sandu, making him powerful enough to lift buildings with his mind,<ref name=\"jim91\">''Journey into Mystery'' #91 (Apr. 1963)</ref> and releasing a [[Lava Men|Lava Man]] called Molto by accident when causing a long-dead volcano to explode.<ref name=\"jim97\">''Journey into Mystery'' #97 (Oct. 1963)</ref> When Loki convinced Odin to punish Thor, Odin took away half of Thor's power, after which Loki returned the memory of the 23rd-century villain [[Zarrko]]. Zarrko defeated Thor and took him back to help conquer his time period, although the God of Thunder was able to finally capture the villain.<ref name=\"jim101-102\">''Journey into Mystery'' #101\u2013102 (1964)</ref> Loki even released [[Mister Hyde (comics)|Mr. Hyde]] and [[Cobra (Marvel Comics)|Cobra]] by paying their bail, then doubled their powers. Loki told them to kidnap [[Jane Foster (comics)|Jane Foster]], which he knew would attract Thor's attention, but Hyde and Cobra were again defeated.<ref>''Journey into Mystery'' #110 (Nov. 1964)</ref> Loki finally went after Jane Foster himself, sending her to another dimension. However [[Doctor Strange]] was able to protect her, and Thor forced Loki to return her.<ref name=\"jim108\">''Journey into Mystery'' #108 (1964)</ref>\n\nAmong Loki's better-known henchmen was the human criminal Carl \"The Crusher\" Creel, whom Loki transformed into the superhuman criminal known as the [[Absorbing Man]].<ref name=\"jim114115\">''Journey into Mystery'' #114\u2013115 (Mar.\u2013Apr. 1965)</ref> Creel would prove to be a formidable adversary to Thor and other Avengers over the years. Loki went so far as to attempt to turn Odin against Thor and to steal Thor's enchanted hammer [[Mjolnir (comics)|Mjolnir]] in an attempt to attain freedom, but his efforts failed. Upon convincing Odin to go to Earth and leave him in charge of Asgard with part of the Odinforce, he released Skagg, the largest Storm Giant, and [[Surtur (Marvel Comics)|Surtur]], the largest Fire Demon, to try to destroy Odin. However, Thor and Balder helped defeat the monsters, and Loki was sent to serve the Trolls. Loki was responsible for the Destroyer being awakened, by leading a Hunter to the Temple where the Destroyer armor resided using their mental abilities while Thor was nearby, causing the soul of the Hunter to animate the armor, but Thor forced the Hunter to return to his body, then buried the armor under thousands of tons of rock.<ref name=\"jim118119\">''Journey into Mystery'' #118\u2013119 (July-Aug. 1965)</ref> The Absorbing Man was brought back to Earth by Loki, and battled Thor, but Loki quickly took him to Asgard when Thor was on the verge of defeating them. The Absorbing Man defeated the Asgardians without too much trouble and absorbed Odin's attacks. However Loki and the Absorbing Man were exiled into space due to a trick by Odin,<ref name=\"jim121123\">''Journey into Mystery'' #121\u2013123 (Oct.\u2013Dec. 1965)</ref> then sending his astral form back to Earth and taking over the Destroyer armor, attempting to take over Asgard; Odin then sent Balder to discover the location of Loki, then using his powers to send Loki out of the Destroyer armor.<ref name=\"thora2\">''Thor'' Annual #2 (Sept. 1966)</ref>\n\n===Taking over Asgard===\nLoki's destiny to be the cause of [[Ragnar\u00f6k]] was later recounted.<ref name=\"thor127\">''Thor'' #127 (Apr. 1966)</ref> Loki returned from exile in space, but was then stripped of his powers and exiled to Earth by Odin. Loki plotted to gain new powers from [[Karnilla]]; however, this accidentally created the [[Wrecker (comics)|Wrecker]], who gained Asgardian powers upon being mistaken for Loki after knocking him out and putting on his helmet just before Karnilla appeared in response to Loki's ritual. He almost killed Thor by collapsing a building on him, as Thor had been stripped of all his powers except his strength by Odin. Loki then fomented a battle between Thor and the [[Destroyer (Thor)|Destroyer]] animated by [[Sif (comics)|Sif]].<ref name=\"thor147152\">''Thor'' #147\u2013152 (Dec. 1967-May 1968)</ref> Loki then took command of Asgard during the Odinsleep, using his right as the 'son' of Odin before Thor could claim it, but fled when Asgard was invaded by [[Mangog]], realizing that this new foe was too powerful.<ref name=\"thor154157\">''Thor'' #154\u2013157 (July-Oct. 1968)</ref>\n\nLoki later usurped the throne of Asgard by taking the Odinring, but fled again when Asgard was invaded by [[Surtur (Marvel Comics)|Surtur]].<ref name=\"thor175177\">''Thor'' #175\u2013177 (Apr.\u2013June 1970)</ref> Subsequently, he attempted to destroy Thor by switching bodies with him, granting him Thor's raw strength against his own inexperienced use of magic in Thor's hands; regardless, Thor was able to regain his true appearance by tricking Loki into throwing Mjolnir away so that it became stuck in a cliff, causing Thor's (Loki's) body to return to the human form of Donald Blake and allowing Thor to regain control of his true form.<ref name=\"thor178181\">''Thor'' #178\u2013181 (July-Oct. 1970)</ref> Much later, Loki usurped the throne of Asgard again and set the Destroyer against Thor once more.<ref name=\"thor264266\">''Thor'' #264\u2013266 (Oct.\u2013Dec. 1977)</ref> Shortly after that, Loki caused the temporary death of [[Balder (comics)|Balder]] using mistletoe, having conspired with [[Hela (comics)|Hela]] to cause [[Ragnar\u00f6k]] if his last plan had failed. At this time, Loki's estranged wife [[Sigyn (Marvel Comics)|Sigyn]] returned to Asgard. When Loki was chained and a viper dripped poison on his face as punishment for killing Balder, Sigyn tried helping him. Loki attempted to bring about Ragnar\u00f6k, but was foiled by Odin.<ref name=\"thor273278\">''Thor'' #273\u2013278 (July-Dec. 1978)</ref> Alongside [[Tyr (Marvel Comics)|Tyr]] and his forces, Loki stole the golden apples of Idunna and invaded Asgard with help from the Midgard serpent, but then changed sides and aided Odin's forces in defeating Tyr.<ref name=\"thor327\">''Thor'' #327 (Jan. 1983)</ref>\n\nDespite Loki's seeming hatred of his adoptive brother and father, Loki helped to defend Asgard from destruction from Surtur and his fire demons. This was because Surtur's goal was to destroy Asgard, whereas Loki sought only to rule it. Alongside Odin and Thor, Loki battled Surtur, and witnessed the seeming demise of Odin.<ref name=\"thor353\">''Thor'' #353 (Mar. 1985)</ref> Not long after that, Loki transformed Thor into a frog for a time, using the Twilight Sword.

With these prime movers, he set into motion a plot against the Avengers and other heroes, sending the Juggernaut against Thor, and casting a spell that caused temporary bouts of weakness in Thor.

Thor, in civilian disguise, gave chase, resulting in the restoration of Loki's memory, but not of his past life with the exception of a guilty conscience for things he cannot remember.

The child Loki refused to follow this path, wanting to be his own person, and transformed the spirit of his former self into a magpie named Ikol. On returning to Earth, he witnessed Odin striking down Thor.<ref>''Journey into Mystery'' #622</ref>\n\nOdin prepared all of Asgard for an unknown battle and imprisoned Thor for attempting to protect Midgard from being scoured. Loki, who disagreed with Odin's actions, was put to work by [[Volstagg]] into cleaning the stables of Thor's goats to keep him out of trouble and danger. Using the wool of one of the goats, Loki descended into the roots of the [[world tree]] at the advice of Ikol to ask questions from the Nornish women who live there. After receiving answers, Loki wept but decided to turn to the imprisoned Thor for his opinion before making his final decision. Breaking into the prison by stealth, Loki asked his brother what he would do if he had to let something bad happen in order to prevent something worse from happening, and what if it cost him everything. With Thor's answer, Loki decided to free one of the imprisoned Hel Wolves and bind it to him in servitude using the bridle of Thor's goats, then revealing he would need help from one more 'personage' before heading for the realm of [[Hela (comics)|Hela]].<ref>''Journey into Mystery'' #623</ref>\n\nHaving recovered Thor's hammer after Thor had been killed and erased from memory following the [[Fear Itself (comics)|war against the Serpent]], Loki was able to work with the [[Silver Surfer]] to restore the hammer to its natural state and send it to Thor in the afterlife, restoring his memory and allowing him to fight his way back into the realm of the living.<ref>''The Mighty Thor'' #6 (Sept. 2011)</ref> After Thor's return, Ikol would afterward reveal that circumstances had been manipulated to force the young Loki to allow his former personality to subsume him and live again, his former slate wiped clean by the \"new\" Loki's actions.<ref name=\"Mystery' 2012\">''Journey into Mystery'' #645 (Oct. 2012)</ref> During his adventures, the young Loki had inadvertently helped create and was tied to a powerful artifact that was about to be used by Mephisto to conquer all the Hells and ultimately everything.<ref>''Journey into Mystery'' #636 (April 2012)</ref> However, if the new Loki ceased to be, the artifact would lose all power.

Once there, Loki tells the group that their only choice to save themselves is to either kill Wiccan, or allow Loki to borrow Wiccan's powers for ten minutes so that he can save them.

With his basic morality inverted, Loki becomes romantically involved with Amora the Enchantress, although soon finds that his inverted morality is not as straightforward as for the other villains. While before Loki was devious but likeable, Verity quickly sees the new Loki is pious, priggish, and while 'good', disloyal to a fault; he betrays Lorelei and Sigurd to the returned All-Father, Odin, knowing full well that Odin will punish their small crime with a heinous overblown punishment. Later, in the final battle of ''AXIS'', Loki fights his brother (whose morality is also inverted) on the moon, and to their surprise, Loki is able to lift Thor's hammer and beat him with it. His triumph, and feeling of great power and accomplishment, is short-lived; Scarlet Witch's second inversion wave restores Loki and Thor's original moral 'axes'. The hammer drops from Loki's hand, and the scream of the Kid Loki whom he killed is heard for miles, bellowing 'I am the crime that cannot be forgiven'. The effects of Scarlet Witch's spell are seen again later; Loki can no longer tell a lie. In a heart to heart with Thor, he finds himself compelled to admit what happened: that he, as Ikol, murdered the sweet reborn Loki and took his chance at life away. Thor, now seeing Loki not as his brother but as a murderous creature that stole his brother's shot at life, surrenders Loki to Asgard for justice at the hands of their people.<ref name=\"Loki: Agent of Asgard #10\">''[[Loki: Agent of Asgard]]'' #10</ref>\n\nAfter Freyja banishes Loki from Asgard, he finds himself on Earth, where King Loki and Verity are. King Loki tells Verity of the awful things Loki did during his time with the Young Avengers, and she flees, not wanting to have to deal with him anymore. King Loki then ties up his younger self and starts telling them why he has done all this. As it turns out, in King Loki's future, Loki did complete his duty as Asgard's agent, clearing all of his horrible deeds from his name. However, he was still viewed as nothing more than the God of Lies, and, being unable to take it anymore, once again became an enemy of Thor; an unknown amount of time later, King Loki destroys the Earth, leaving it a barren wasteland. King Thor confronts King Loki, Loki raising an army of skeletal Avengers, fleeing while Thor fights his undead friends. Realizing that he would never be able to defeat his brother, King Loki goes back in time to a time when Thor was at his weakest, when he lacked the power to wield Mjolnir. By moving the time-table up by only a few years, King Loki could kill Thor while still one day successfully destroying the Earth.<ref name=\"Loki: Agent of Asgard #12\">''Loki: Agent of Asgard'' #12</ref>\n\nLoki then goes into a metaphorical space, where Old Loki and Kid Loki are, telling him that he will not be able to change his story. Verity then calls him out, telling Loki that because King Loki did not recognize her, an alternate future is already unfolding. Loki now decides to change his destiny, realizing that lies are just stories, and as god of them, he can tell a new one. He then seemingly destroys himself, sending King Loki to the now changed near-future. Eight months pass, and the sky turns red as the [[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]] is about to begin, when Verity hears a knock on her door, with Loki standing there, claiming to be the \"God of Stories\".<ref name=\"Loki: Agent of Asgard #13\">''Loki: Agent of Asgard'' #13</ref>\n\n[[File:LokiReborn.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Loki reborn.

Just as it seems certain that King Loki will defeat the Asgardians, Freyja sacrificed her life to destroy Jormungandr and Odin blows the fabled Gjallarhorn (the Horn of Heroes) to resurrect the dead gods, as foretold, for their final battle. To King Loki's astonishment, Loki is alive and turns up to join the legion of deceased gods in Asgard's defence. Upon being faced with Loki and all the resurrected gods, King Loki loses his nerve and flees into the ether.<ref>''Loki: Agent of Asgard'' #15</ref> Loki is hailed by all as a hero. This is exactly what all previous iterations of Loki would have wanted most: attention, adoration, praise. Odin even proudly compares Loki to Thor and calls him \"son\", but Loki shakes off Odin's promises insisting that he is done taking \"sides\". Loki and Verity then survive the incursion,<ref>''Loki: Agent of Asgard'' #16</ref> and chase away the gods who sit above the Multiverse, who want Loki to surrender the stories of Asgard, which he is keeping in preservation. They also discover King Loki, another survivor of the incursions, and upon explaining that he understands King Loki's motivations. King Loki breaks down in tears, and Loki places his alternate self in his sceptre as a reminder of his potential to commit great evil. Loki then explains that the universe will be reborn, and invites Verity to follow him, into a new reality by creating a door labelled 'Next', although he unsure as to whether he will change again on the other side.<ref name=\"Loki: Agent of Asgard #17\">''Loki: Agent of Asgard'' #17</ref>\n\n==== Presidential campaign ====\n{{Expand section|date=August 2021}}\n{{Further|Vote Loki}}\nFollowing [[Reed Richards]]' interference in the [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|multiverse]]'s rebirth, Loki led a presidential campaign called \"[[Vote Loki]]\".<ref>''[[Vote Loki]]'' #1.

However, he could not coerce Thor to give him Mjolnir.<ref name=\"jim85\"/> If someone has evil thoughts, Loki can influence their actions (even if they are in Asgard and the subject is on Earth),<ref name=\"jim118119\"/> and can influence other events to some degree, such as diverting a missile from its path,<ref name=\"jim94\">''Journey into Mystery'' #94 (July 1963)</ref> or redirecting a radio signal.<ref>''The Avengers'' #1</ref>\n\nLoki is an adept [[shapeshifter]] and can change into animals (examples include [[transmogrification]] to a salmon, horse, etc.) or impersonate other people, such as Thor or [[Captain America]]. However, he does not necessarily gain the abilities of whatever or whoever he turns into, although minor natural abilities such as flight in bird form tend to work. Loki may mimic the abilities of some supernatural beings if they turn into such creatures. Loki has also turned clouds into dragons, and animated trees to attack Thor.<ref name=\"jim92\">''Journey into Mystery'' #92 (May 1963)</ref> After his rebirth, his shapeshifting abilities are more limited. He explained to [[Lorelei (Asgardian)|Lorelei]] that, \"I can turn into anything, as long as it's me\", which he demonstrates by transforming into the female Lady Loki and a lupine form.<ref>''Loki: Agent of Asgard'' #5 (2014)</ref>\n\nLoki has imbued himself with magical abilities that enables him to withstand injuries that would prove fatal to another Asgardian, such as being beheaded by Balder.

He is sometimes armed with a sword, a whip, or a three-pronged spear and has used magical items (such as the Norn Stones{{issue|date=December 2013}}) to enhance his powers.\n\n==Other versions==\n\n===Loki Triumphant===\nA 4-issue series simply titled ''Loki'', where Loki has now claimed leadership of Asgard, and all must recognize that fact, even Thor. Finally winning the throne after a long-sought out fight is not as sweet as he thought it would be. The ones that helped him now demand their due and the favors he promised them, including the death goddess Hela and seductress [[Lorelei (Asgardian)|Lorelei]].<ref>''Loki'' #1 (Aug. 2004)</ref> While he goes about his kingdom, Loki continually turns to his prisoners, Thor and Sif. Sif berates Loki for being jealous of her, and of cutting off her golden hair, only to bring about a greater love between her and Thor. While Balder reminds him that they have died and gone to Hell, and while there, he saw that there are parallel dimension incarnations of Thor, Loki, and Balder; some different, yet all play the same roles. And Loki's role is never to rule. Loki then turns to Karnilla, and agrees to free Balder into her care, in exchange for her to peer into a myriad other dimensions.<ref>''Loki'' #2 (Sept. 2004)</ref> There Loki sees confirmation of Balder's words, all with Thor triumphant. Loki decides that Thor will indeed die at dawn by beheading. While walking out of the dungeons, he runs into [[F\u00e1rbauti]], his birth father.<ref>''Loki'' #3 (Oct. 2004)</ref> Loki decides to go against fate, and spare his brother as well as free him, while Hela is revealed to be a failed illusion cast by another Loki to convince him to kill their brother. Thor decides that when breaking free from his prison, he will defeat his sibling.<ref>''Loki'' #4 (Nov. 2004)</ref>\n\n===Heroes Reborn===\nIn the reality of [[Heroes Reborn (1996 comic)|''Heroes Reborn'']], Loki set forth to return to Asgard where he finds that the Rainbow bridge is missing and, upon searching mystically, realizes that the nine worlds of Asgard are seemingly missing. He goes searching for his brother and finds him frozen in a block of ice in Norway, where he has just been discovered by archeologist Dr. Donald Blake. Loki attempts to destroy Thor then and there and finds that his magic is unable to do so. To his surprise, he found that he had been reborn in this reality. Blake showed the Avengers the frozen Thor and after they work together to free him from the ice, Loki tricked the confused Thor into battling the Avengers. Thor eventually realized his sibling's deception and watched as the Scarlet Witch banished Loki into limbo. They offered Thor a spot on the team and he accepted.<ref>''The Avengers'' vol. 2 #1 (Nov. 1996)</ref>\n\nRealizing this universe had no Asgard, and as such no Odin, Loki decided a larger revenge scheme was in order, and sought out Enchantress to help him in this end. He sought to take control of the [[Scarlet Witch]] and make her his pawn. In doing so, he incapacitated her teacher [[Agatha Harkness]], trapping her essence in a tree and had the Enchantress pose as her. The Enchantress then put the Scarlet Witch under her spell. Loki meanwhile tricked the Hulk into attacking Avengers Island, causing a breach in the gamma core there; however, an assemblage of the Avengers and [[Fantastic Four]] prevented any disaster from happening.<ref>''The Avengers'' vol. 2 #4\u20136 (Feb.\u2013Apr. 1997)</ref>\n\nRealizing the foes that some people on this world had a unique energy that Loki could absorb (thereby absorbing their bodies), he sought out these beings and absorbed their power. While keeping the Avengers busy he absorbed the forms of [[Kang the Conqueror|Kang]], [[Mantis (Marvel Comics)|Mantis]], [[Baron Zemo]], [[MODOK]], Executioner, [[Wonder Man]] and others; he also tricked the Avengers [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Hawkeye]] and [[Patsy Walker|Hellcat]] to join his ranks, transferring Hellcat's essence into Scarlet Witch's body. Thor soon grew tired of the Avengers' morality on killing their foes and left the group, becoming easy prey for the Enchantress to enthrall him to joining Loki's side.<ref>''The Avengers'' vol. 2 #8\u20139 (June\u2013July 1997)</ref>\n\nLoki soon learned that the source of the power he was absorbing came from the gamma core on Avengers Island, which was a rift in time and space that was seemingly creating villains for the Avengers to fight. He sent his minions to attack the remaining Avengers (now teamed with the true Thor of Earth-616) while he absorbed this power. When Loki absorbed the power from the gamma core, he was given untold power and grew to gigantic proportions. When Thor and Enchantress attempted to join him, he betrayed them. Realizing this betrayal, Hawkeye, Thor, Enchantress and Hellcat go over to the heroes side and Enchantress, Agatha Harkness and Scarlet Witch pool their magical powers to turn one of the Thors into a giant replica of Odin to battle Loki while the other Avengers work to build a device that will reverse Loki's newly obtained powers. Captain America goes toe-to-toe against Loki buying the others enough time to hit Loki with their power reversal cannon and allowing Thor to strike him with his hammer. The resulting combination causes Loki to suddenly disburse into the energy that he absorbed, seemingly destroying him and ending his threat.<ref>''The Avengers'' vol. 2 #11 (Sept. 1997)</ref>\n\n===Earth X===\n[[File:Loki Laufeyson (Earth X).jpg|thumb|upright|Loki in alternate universe Earth X. Art by [[Matt Hollingsworth]]]]\nIn the reality of [[Earth-9997]], Loki duped Odin into transforming Thor into a woman, saying he needed to learn humility in the form of a female. He later cast a spell on the Bifrost that if Thor would return to Asgard, he would get free rein on Earth.<ref>''Earth X'' #5 (Aug. 1999)</ref> In this reality, Loki figured out that Asgardians are not actually gods, but are instead long-lived mutants of incredible power who are mentally mind-locked by the [[Celestial (comics)|Celestials]] into believing that they are immortal, never-changing gods so that they will not evolve further as mutants and potentially become a threat to their plans for Earth in the future. He tells Odin and the others of their true origin but they refuse to believe them. In order to make them see the truth, he stabs himself in the heart and is cast into Hela's realm of the dead. He then convince them to oppose the Celestials' attack on Earth, but when fighting the Celestials, they make the Asgardians think that they are nothing and already dead, all except Loki.<ref>''Earth X'' #X (June 2000)</ref>\n\nYears later, Odin sent Thor to Earth as a champion to battle Loki, but Loki convinced Thor of Odin's manipulation over the Asgardians and the two team up to battle him.<ref>''Universe X'' #4 (Jan. 2001)</ref> After Odin was defeated and Earth was safe, Thor reverted to his form of Donald Blake and Loki transformed himself into a new Thor, and with [[Ransak the Reject]] and Ahura, son of [[Black Bolt]], they became a new incarnation of the Avengers.<ref>''Paradise X'' #4 (Sept. 2002)</ref>\n\n===Guardians of the Galaxy===\nIn the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (1969 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]] timeline (Earth-691), Loki is alive and well in the 31st Century, living on the moon. He leads an attack on Asgard with his squad of Inhuman Assassins for Composite's sonic diffusion muzzle when he is stopped by Woden Thorson, his nephew.<ref>''Guardians of the Galaxy'' #42 (Nov. 1993)</ref> With the help of [[Talon (Marvel Comics)|Talon]] and [[Aleta Ogord|Aleta]], they imprison Loki. Woden, Thor and Odin stand together to decide Loki's punishment and all three grasp Mjolnir and banish Loki and his Inhuman Assassin Squad to the Black Canyon.<ref>''Guardians of the Galaxy'' #43 (Dec. 1993)</ref>\n\n===Marvel 2099===\nIn the [[Marvel 2099]] line of series, the original Asgardians were no more but the belief in them had grown into a full-fledged religion with many followers. Seeking to take advantage of this, a corporation called \"Alchemax\" decided to create their own Valhalla. One of the company's scientists, Jordan Boone, decided that he wanted to have powers and snuck into the program where he became Loki but still maintained his own personality. Boone (Loki) helps [[Doom 2099|Doom]], [[Krystalin]], [[Bloodhawk]], [[Skullfire|Timothy Fitzgerald]] and [[Meanstreak (comics)|Meanstreak]] fight Alchemax's versions of Thor and Heimdall. After Heimdall is defeated, Loki watches as Doom defeats Thor, gloating about his plan to pit Alchemax and heroes against each other to gain enough superpower to shapeshift out of it. He transforms into a bird and flies away.<ref>''X-Men 2099'' #5 (Feb 1994)</ref>\n\nWhen Loki is next seen, he appears as the villainous Halloween Jack after being tortured by Desdemona and her brother Lytton after they accuse him of cheating in their casino. Loki seeks revenge on them for turning him \"into a monster\" and with the help of Meanstreak, he heads to Las Vegas and finds Desdemona alone in her office. He attack her, revealing to her his true form (Loki) and hacks into her accounts planning to 'make Vegas fun again'.<ref>''X-Men 2099'' #17 (Feb. 1995)</ref>\n\n===Marvel Zombies===\nIn the alternate ''[[Marvel Zombies (series)|Marvel Zombies]]'' universe, Loki is shown dead, having been eaten by the Zombie Avengers.<ref name=\"mzr1\">''[[Marvel Zombies Return]]'' #5 (Sept. 2009)</ref>\n\n===MC2===\nIn the reality of [[Marvel Comics 2|Earth-982]], Loki kidnaps several major superheroes including [[Thunderstrike (Kevin Masterson)]], [[Cassandra Lang|the Stinger]], [[Jolt (comics)|Jolt]], [[Jubilee (comics)|Jubilation Lee]], [[Robbie Baldwin|Speedball]], [[J2 (comics)|J2]] and [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Mainframe]] after sending a fake distress call from the former Avengers mansion. He ties them up and takes them to Asgard, where he wants to use Thunderstrike's mace's powers for himself, but Kevin disrupts the spell, absorbing the mace into himself and transforming into a new Thunderstrike in the process. Loki and his army of Trolls are forced into retreat by the heroes, with help from Thor, now the King of Asgard. Thunderstrike, Stinger, J2 and Mainframe decide to stay together as the new Avengers. The adult heroes decline to stay with the reformed team because of personal reasons.<ref>''A-Next'' #1 (Oct. 1998)</ref>\n\nYears later, Loki is bitter about the fact that he was the cause of the Avengers' formation and wants to get his revenge. They start kidnapping heroes, holding them prisoner in life-sized crystals when [[Captain America]], J2, Thunderstrike, [[Spider-Girl (Mayday Parker)|Spider-Girl]] and [[Wild Thing (comics)|Wild Thing]] show up through a portal they found in another universe. The heroes are quickly outnumbered by Loki's robots and they vow to end ''The Age of Heroes''.<ref>''Last Hero Standing'' #2 (Sept. 2005)</ref>\n\nJ2 and Spider-Girl escape but Captain America and Thunderstrike are chained and Loki plans to brainwash the heroes to send them back to Earth where they will become violent and turn against each so they will eventually destroy all the heroes. His plan is ruined by Thor when he shows up after figuring out why certain superheroes are acting so much differently. Together, Thor, Captain America, Hulk and Spider-Girl get Loki to surrender. Captain America notices a gem hanging on Loki's neck, and smashes it with his shield. Loki was using this gem to help turn the heroes evil but once the gem is destroyed, the heroes revert to normal. A furious Loki releases a deadly blast on Captain America, killing him. Thor uses his hammer and sends Loki into Limbo forever and the Hulk decides to join him to make sure that Loki remains there. After Captain America dies, Thor uses his hammer to grant Captain America's soul immortality. His soul floats into the skies, and creates a shiny new, bright star in the sky in the form of Captain America's shield, meant to always inspire the heroes and future generations to come.<ref>''Last Hero Standing'' #2\u20133 (Oct.-Nov. 2005)</ref>\n\nIn this universe, Loki has a daughter, Sylene. She seeks revenge on the Avengers especially Thor for Loki.<ref>''Avengers Next'' #1 (Jan. 2007)</ref>\n\n===Mutant X===\nIn the ''[[Mutant X (comics)|Mutant X]]'' universe, when Loki tampered with [[Iceman (Marvel Comics)|Iceman]]'s powers, he left Iceman unable to touch other humans without ending their lives.<ref name=\"mx1\">''[[Mutant X (comics)|Mutant X]]'' #1 (Oct. 1998)</ref>\n\n===Old Man Logan===\nIn this alternate reality, Loki is allegedly killed (while giant-size) when the [[Baxter Building]] is dropped on them.

Art by [[Greg Land]]]]\nLoki appears in ''[[The Ultimates 2]]'' as the evil half-sibling of [[Ultimate Thor|Thor]].<ref name=\"Ultimates 2 #1\">''The Ultimates 2'' #1</ref>\nThe Ultimate version of Loki has the ability to \"shuffle time and space\", and in his first appearance, causes a ripple during Thor's conversation with [[Volstagg]]. In the restaurant, Loki is apparently in the background, which would mark his first \"appearance\" (he is mentioned and his powers apparently used, but they are only briefly seen).<ref name=\"Ultimates 2 #1\"/> Loki comes to Earth after escaping from the Room Without Doors and begins to cause havoc, especially for Thor and the [[United States]] after assisting the [[Masters of Evil|Liberators]] (multinational group of superpowered villains representing [[Syria]], [[China]], [[Iran]], [[Russia]], [[North Korea]], and [[France]]). Through his power he creates the persona for himself of \"'''Gunnar Golmen'''\", the head scientist of the [[Norway|Norwegian]] extension of the \"European Defense Initiative\", the European counterpart to The Ultimates, and turns Thor into \"Thorlief\", Gunnar's brother, a former mental patient who stole the technology that Gunnar created for the Initiative.<ref>''The Ultimates 2'' #4</ref>\n\nLater in the story, he confronts the captive Thor and gloats that it is all just another one of his games, and informs him that there is a traitor in the ranks of the Ultimates. When Thor requests assistance from the guards, Loki is nowhere to be seen, though he appears as a snake around Thor's neck after they leave (most likely a nod to the real Loki in Norse mythology).<ref>''The Ultimates 2'' #6</ref> At the end of ''The Ultimates 2'' #9, Loki states that the reason he joined the Liberators was because \"They had a Norse god on their side. It's only fair you should get one too\", and that \"Odin sent his son to bring the world peace. I couldn't resist the opportunity to mess that up.\"<ref>''The Ultimates 2'' #9</ref> However, he is hesitant to use his abilities overtly as he claims Odin will then be able to find them. Yet once all The Liberators are defeated, he decides to do things himself. After revealing to the Ultimates who he truly is, he rises into the air and change the color of the sky. At that moment\u2014thanks to the Scarlet Witch 'calculating the odds' of someone showing up to defeat them\u2014the sky opens and Thor, his brother, appears for revenge.<ref>''The Ultimates 2'' #12</ref>\n\nIssue 13 shows further demonstrations of his powers by attempting to trap Thor in an illusion and withstanding a direct blow from Thor's hammer uninjured, claiming it cannot hurt him. During this battle, Thor mentions that Loki's powers have weakened for an unexplained reason. After Loki summons an army of monsters to battle the Ultimates and nearly kills Thor, the thunder god then proceeds to summon allies from Asgard while he strikes Loki with his hammer, sending him back to Asgard where Odin awaits.<ref name=\"Ultimates 2 #13\">''The Ultimates 2'' #13</ref>\n\nLoki's motivations for his actions are not completely revealed. He mentions several motivations, from a desire to cause World War III to Odin favoring Thor over him and attempting to gain Odin's favor.<ref>''The Ultimates 2'' #8</ref> Throughout the whole ordeal, Loki regards humans as mere playthings for his pranks. In addition to creating a Norwegian super-soldier program that was supposedly part of an EU initiative and making people believe it was real, even though Norway is not part of the [[European Union]], he claimed to have been the one who framed [[Captain America (Ultimate Marvel character)|Captain America]] for treason and murdering [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Hawkeye]]'s family, regarding the failure of humans to realize the problems with these assertions as humorous.<ref name=\"Ultimates 2 #13\"/>\n\nLoki is freed from his \"punishment\" in ''[[New Ultimates]]'',<ref>''New Ultimates'' #1</ref> playing an integral part in the re-appearance of the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]], now super-powered, as well the invasion of trolls to [[New York City|New York]] with the help of [[Enchantress (Marvel Comics)|Amora the Enchantress]].<ref name=\"New Ultimates #2\">''New Ultimates'' #2</ref> He is later revealed to be the one behind [[Valkyrie (Marvel Comics)|Valkyrie]]'s powers manifesting after the invasion forces attacked America.<ref name=\"New Ultimates #2\"/> In revenge against Thor, Loki impales Valkyrie with a sword, to which she is restored by [[Hela (comics)|Hela]] as a real Valkyrie and takes vengeance on Loki, banishing him to [[Hel (location)|Hel]].<ref>''Ultimate Comics: New Ultimates'' #5</ref> Loki and every other Asgardian, excluding Thor, were killed by the Children of Tomorrow (led by [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]]) when Asgard was destroyed.<ref>''Ultimate Comics: Ultimates'' #2</ref>\n\n''[[Ultimate Comics: Thor]]'' elaborates Loki's backstory. Loki is the child of Odin and the giantess Laufey, who procreated him as part of a peace settlement between Asgard and Jotunheim. Loki was always jealous of his older brother Thor for having been given Mjolnir and rebelled against Asgard by stealing the sacred Norn Stones (relic extensions of Odin's power) and killing their half-brother Balder with their favoured bow. Banished from Asgard, Loki (going under the disguise of Nazi supervillain [[Baron Zemo]]) waged an attack on the kingdom eons later, in 1939, with a coalition army of Frost Giants and Nazi soldiers, killing every Asgardian in sight. Loki attempted a battle with Odin, only to be forced into the Room Without Doors while Asgard was destroyed. Using the Stones, Loki is later summoned by an older Nazi, [[Helmut Zemo]] (around the time The Hulk was fighting the Ultimates in [[Manhattan]] during Ultimates vol. 1). For his loyalty, Loki kills him.<ref>''Ultimate Comics: Thor'' #4</ref>\n\n===Goddess of Thunder===\nReality on Earth-1026, Thor has met and fallen in love with [[Ororo Munroe]] from the [[X-Men]]. Loki casts a spell on [[Tarene]], who is insanely jealous of Ororo because she too has feelings for Thor. Maddened by Loki's spell, Tarene goes after Ororo and is killed by Thor when he steps in to protect her. With Tarene's death, her hammer goes to Ororo, making her Goddess of Thunder.<ref>''X-Men: Millennial Visions'' #2 (Jan. 2002)</ref>\n\n===Earth 3515===\n[[File:Loki Amazing Spider-Man 795.png|thumb|Loki wears [[Doctor Strange]]'s Cloak of Levitation and [[Eye of Agamotto]] (April 2018).

After not being able to take it anymore, he stabbed Thor and proceeded to destroy the Earth, killing everyone on it. King Thor comes to seek revenge, but King Loki raises the undead Avengers to attack him. Knowing he cannot defeat his brother, King Loki retreats to the past, where he plans to kill the Odinson while he cannot wield Mjolnir.<ref name=\"Loki: Agent of Asgard #12\"/> This future was ultimately avoided when the present Loki changes his fate, but King Loki is still at large.<ref name=\"Loki: Agent of Asgard #13\"/>\n\nDuring the \"Last Days\" part of the ''[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]'' storyline, King Loki devises a plan that involves traveling to Hel to free a monster that will destroy Asgard. The Asgardians later gather to witness King Loki on the back of the Midgard Serpent where they believe that this will be their end.<ref name=\"Loki: Agent of Asgard #14\"/> However, the real Loki appears and wards them off, just as the universe ends. As Loki is now the God of Stories, he saves a memory of the universe in the form of a story. After everything in existence is gone, Loki confronts a crying King Loki. As Loki would not be here without him, he embraces his no-longer future self. King Loki disappears, and Loki and his friend Verity await to see what the universe's next story will bring.<ref name=\"Loki: Agent of Asgard #17\"/>\n\nAfter the timeline is restored, it was revealed that Loki was seeking All-Black the Necrosword, the first [[Symbiote (comics)|symbiote]].

After the [[Enchantress (Marvel Comics)|Enchantress]] frees him in the episode \"Masters of Evil\", Loki returns in the episodes \"This Hostage Earth\", \"The Fall of Asgard\", and \"A Day Unlike Any Other\" to conquer Asgard and eight of the nine realms by using the [[Masters of Evil]] to invade Earth using [[Karnilla]]'s [[Norn Stones]]. While the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] destroy the stones, they accidentally transport themselves to each of the eight realms. When Thor is captured, Loki reveals he had a hand in much of the series' events, such as the Avengers and Masters of Evil's formations, and that his initial attack and exile were part of a diversion.
