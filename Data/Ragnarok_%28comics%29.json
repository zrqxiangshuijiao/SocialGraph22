He helped [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]] and [[Hank Pym]] clone the [[Asgard (comics)|Asgardian]] [[DNA]] within while fusing the cloned DNA with [[Stark Industries]] technology. This resulted in the creation of a new cyborg clone of Thor. The clone was put into action during the superhero [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]], sent to battle anti-registration heroes.<ref>[[Mark Millar]]. ''Civil War'' #3 (September 2006). Marvel Comics.</ref> The heroes were easily brought down by the cyborg clone, but [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]] helped the heroes to escape. The battle got out of hand when the clone killed [[Bill Foster (comics)|Goliath]] by blasting him through the chest and set out to kill the rest of the anti-registration heroes. Reed Richards deactivated the cyborg with a vocal code and later operated on his brain to prevent such a mishap from happening again.<ref>Mark Millar. ''Civil War'' #4 (October 2006). Marvel Comics.</ref> The cyborg clone of Thor returned during the final battle between the pro- and anti-registration heroes. He faced off against [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]] and [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] who defeat the cyborg clone by ramming his own hammer into his skull claiming it was an insult to the Odinson and yelling at the cyborg clone \"Thou art no Thor.\"<ref>Mark Millar. ''Civil War'' #7 (January 2007). Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nThe clone's remains were taken to [[Camp Hammond (comics)|Camp Hammond]] and stored in the laboratory for experimentation. [[Baron Von Blitzschlag]] tells Pym he admires his work, showing the Thor clone to demonstrate this. During the \"[[Secret Invasion]]\" storyline, it was revealed that the Hank Pym who helped create the cyborg clone was actually the clone of a [[Skrull]] impostor named [[Criti Noll]] who had placed a program into the cloned Thor's remains as a contingency in case of the invasion's failure. Unless a special code which only the Skrull knew was input every eighteen days, the cyborg clone would reawaken. With the clone of Criti Noll's death during the Invasion, this event came to pass during the \"[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]\" storyline. Malfunctioning and believing himself to be the true Thor, the cyborg clone believed he had been imprisoned in Camp Hammond. He threatened Baron Von Blitzschlag into returning his hammer to him and set out to destroy [[Avengers: The Initiative|the Initiative]].<ref name=\"AvengInit#21\">{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Christos N.

During that time, he took on the name Ragnar\u00f6k (which the Baron had called him, declaring that he would \"bring the end of all that is\"). Ragnar\u00f6k was only stopped when Von Blitzschlag, whose electrical powers made him immune to Ragnar\u00f6k's lightning, arrived on the battlefield. The Baron showed Ragnar\u00f6k footage of his creation and showed him that the real Thor had returned and had formed a new [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]] above the city. Disgusted by what he perceived as Asgard's \"indignity\", Ragnar\u00f6k left Camp Hammond to confront the real Thor.<ref name=\"AvengInit#22\">{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Christos N.

Ragnar\u00f6k and the rest of the Dark Avengers were able to return to their world.<ref>''Dark Avengers'' #190. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nAs a [[cyborg]] [[cloning|clone]] of Thor, Ragnar\u00f6k possesses a portion of the powers and knowledge of the God of Thunder prior to Thor's acquisition of the Odinforce. This includes super-strength, extensive combat knowledge, godly stamina, high resistance to physical injury, immunity to all Earthly diseases, and superhuman agility and reflexes.\n\nRagnar\u00f6k's hammer, though not the enchanted [[Mjolnir (comics)|Mjolnir]], is constructed of a vibranium and adamantium alloy. The hammer is able to absorb and discharge lightning, like the true Mjolnir, and has circuitry within its head, which allows Ragnar\u00f6k to direct it mentally. However, unlike Mjolnir, it can be picked up or lifted by others.\n\nDuring a visit to Earth-13584, Ragnar\u00f6k acquires that universe's version of Mjolnir and is accepted as worthy to wield it.\n\n==Other versions==\n===What If?===\nIn a \"[[What If (comics)|What If?]] Civil War\" scenario titled \"What if Iron Man Lost the Civil War,\" Iron Man confronted [[Captain America]] and admitted that while he felt he was doing the right thing, he was worried that he was going about it the wrong way and that he needed Cap's help. This admission persuades Captain America not to use a concealed device that would have disabled Iron Man's armor. Unfortunately, an agent on board the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier detected the device and released Ragnar\u00f6k prematurely. Reed Richards was quickly knocked out by the clone before Richards could employ the shutdown code. When Ragnar\u00f6k tried to kill Bill Foster, Iron Man leapt in front of him to block the blast. Ragnar\u00f6k then attempted to kill Iron Man, but Captain America held him off long enough for Iron Man's armor to repair itself. The two heroes then joined forces, which inspired every other hero in the pro/anti-registration conflict to join together to defeat Ragnar\u00f6k.<ref>''What If? Civil War'' #1.
