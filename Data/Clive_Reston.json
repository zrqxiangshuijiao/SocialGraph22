The character was patterned on [[James Bond (literary character)|James Bond]] and Roper from the [[Bruce Lee]] Movie ''[[Enter the Dragon]]''. Clive Reston was an agent of MI-6 and an ally to [[Denis Nayland Smith]] and [[Shang-Chi]]. During his time with MI-6, he started a relationship with [[Leiko Wu]], but she left him for Simon Bretnor who turned out to be the mad assassin Mordillo.<ref name=MoKF34>{{Cite comic\n| cartoonist = \n| story = \n| title = Master of Kung Fu\n| volume = \n| issue = #34\n| date = November 1979\n| publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]\n| location = \n| page = \n| panel = \n| id =\n}}</ref>\n\n==Publication history==\nClive Reston first appeared in Giant-Size Master of Kung Fu issue three, in 1974, created by [[Doug Moench]]. He went on to be a recurring character in the ''[[Master of Kung Fu (comics)|Master of Kung Fu]]'' series, as well as occasionally appearing in other series such as ''[[Rom (comics)|Rom]]'' and ''[[List of X-Men comics|X-Men]]''. He also recently appeared in the [[MAX (comics)|MAX]] series ''[[Wisdom (comics)|Wisdom]]'', centered on the character [[Pete Wisdom]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookdb.com/character_chron.php?ID=12032 |title=Clive Reston |publisher=Comic Book DB |date= |accessdate=2012-07-14}}</ref> Originally, Reston's father was intended to be [[James Bond (literary character)|James Bond]], and his maternal granduncle was intended to be [[Sherlock Holmes]], however due to copyright laws [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] was forced to abandon this.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookdb.com/character.php?ID=12032 |title=Clive Reston |publisher=Comic Book DB |date= |accessdate=2012-07-14}}</ref> Now, of course, it is widely known that Shang-Chi was basically [[Sax Rohmer]]\u2019s [[Fu Manchu]] novels fused together with [[Bruce Lee]] movies, but there is much of the concept that had been inspired by from ''Enter the Dragon''. Bruce Lee\u2019s character in the movie practically is Shang-Chi, and his uneasy alliance with wisecracking pal Roper [[John Saxon]] echoes, in many ways, Shang-Chi\u2019s give-and-take with agent Clive Reston. Saxon's image was replaced with that of [[Sean Connery]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2008/02/08/exploitation-friday/ | title=Exploitation Friday! &#124; CBR}}</ref>\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nReston first appeared as an ally to [[Shang-Chi]], the master of kung fu. He also had a romantic relationship with Melissa Greville, and the two were both present at the funeral of James Larner.
