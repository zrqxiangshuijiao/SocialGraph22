It included adaptions of most of Edgar Rice Burroughs's original Tarzan books (skipping only ''Tarzan and the Leopard Men'', ''Tarzan the Magnificent'', ''Tarzan and the Madman'' and ''Tarzan and the Castaways''), as well as original stories and other features. Almost all of the Dell ''Tarzan'' stories were written by [[Gaylord Du Bois]] (notably, not before Dell issue #2, and some of the stories in the Tarzan issues of the Dell Giant series) and all of the Gold Key stories. Western also published a companion series, ''Korak: Son of Tarzan'' for 45 issues from 1964 to 1972, all of which were written by Du Bois). When Western refused to expand the number of Edgar Rice Burroughs comic books being published, Edgar Rice Burroughs, Inc. sold the rights to DC Comics, who were willing to publish more comics so long as they sold. This decision was motivated by the lucrative overseas reprint rights, which Edgar Rice Burroughs, Inc. were selling to foreign publishers on a per-page rate.<ref name=\"DAK2\">{{cite news | author = Kraft, David Anthony | author2 = Slifer, Roger | author-link = David Anthony Kraft | author-link2 = Roger Slifer | date = April 1983 | title = Mark Evanier | work = [[Comics Interview]] | issue = 2 | pages = 23\u201334 | publisher = [[Fictioneer Books]]}}</ref>\n\n====DC Comics====\nDC Comics took over the series in 1972, publishing ''Tarzan'' #207\u2013258 from April 1972 to February 1977.<ref name=\"Overstreet\" /><ref>{{gcdb series|id= 2035|title= ''Tarzan'' (DC Comics)}}</ref> DC continued the numbering from the Gold Key series, rather than starting over at #1.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Sacks |first1=Jason |last2=Dallas |first2=Keith |title=American Comic Book Chronicles: The 1970s |date=2014 |publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing |isbn=978-1605490564 |page=83}}</ref> Publishers believed at the time that a series would sell less if people perceived it as new. \n\nThis version initially showcased artist [[Joe Kubert]]'s depiction of the character, considered some of the best work of the artist's career.<ref>{{cite book|last1=McAvennie|first1= Michael|last2=Dolan|first2=Hannah, ed.|chapter= 1970s|title = DC Comics Year By Year A Visual Chronicle|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]]|year=2010|location= London, United Kingdom|isbn= 978-0-7566-6742-9|page= 151|quote = Tarzan enjoyed a prolific period in comics when DC acquired the rights to novelist Edgar Rice Burroughs' iconic ape-man.

They wanted the Russ Manning versions, but John Buscema wanted to make it as much like the Joe Kubert version as possible. Also, the foreign publishers needed stories in fifteen-page increments, because most of the books feature thirty pages of material and two pages of ads.

''[[Batman/Tarzan: Claws of the Cat-woman]]'' is a \"straight\" team-up between Tarzan and the 1930s Batman to save an ancient city \u2013 during which the two form an effective team as they acknowledge their similar origins, despite such differences as Tarzan's willingness to use lethal force.<ref>{{cite book|last = Marz|first = Ron|author-link = Ron Marz|author2=Kordey, Igor |author-link2=Igor Kordey |title = Batman/Tarzan: Claws of the Cat-Woman|publisher = [[Dark Horse Comics]]|year = 2000|pages = 96|isbn = 1569714665}}</ref> ''[[Superman/Tarzan: Sons of the Jungle]]'' is a revisionist version in which Lord Greystoke grows up in England, while Kal-El is raised by the apes as \"Argozan\", although the two switch roles at the conclusion with Greystoke remaining in the jungle while Kal-El returns to the city, Greystoke stating in a letter to his parents that he feels as though he has found his true place.<ref>{{cite book|last = Dixon|first = Chuck|author-link = Chuck Dixon|author2=Meglia, Carlos |author-link2=Carlos Meglia |title = Superman/Tarzan: Sons of the Jungle|publisher = Dark Horse Comics|year = 2002|pages = 80|isbn = 1569717613}}</ref> Tarzan also fought the [[Predator (alien)|Predators]] in the ''[[Tarzan vs. Predator: At the Earth's Core]]'' miniseries.<ref>{{cite book|last = Simonson|first = Walt|author-link = Walt Simonson|author2=Weeks, Lee |author-link2=Lee Weeks |title = Tarzan vs. Predator: At the Earth's Core|publisher = Dark Horse Comics|year = 1997|pages = 104|isbn = 156971231X}}</ref>\n\nIn 2015, Sequential Pulp Comics, a graphic novel imprint distributed by Dark Horse Comics, published ''Jungle Tales of Tarzan'' by writer Martin Powell and artists [[Pablo Marcos]], [[Terry Beatty]], [[Will Meugniot]], Nik Poliwko, Antonio Romero Olmedo, [[Mark Wheatley (comics)|Mark Wheatley]], Diana Leto, [[Steven E.

The publisher avoided using the character's name on the cover, as not to violate the trademark, even though the character is in the [[public domain]] and freely available to use but ERB, Inc. brought a lawsuit against Dynamite.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://comicsbeat.com/dyanmite-responds-to-erb-in-tarzanjohn-carter-lawsuit/|title= Dynamite responds to ERB in Tarzan/John Carter lawsuit|first= Heidi|last= MacDonald|author-link= Heidi MacDonald|date= April 5, 2012|publisher= Comics Beat|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140803172324/http://comicsbeat.com/dyanmite-responds-to-erb-in-tarzanjohn-carter-lawsuit/|archive-date= August 3, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> In 2013, a crossover with John Carter was released entitled ''Lords of Mars''.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=45567|title= ''Warlord of Mars'' & ''Lord of the Jungle'' Clash in Dynamite's ''Lords of Mars''|date= May 17, 2013|publisher= [[Comic Book Resources]]|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20131026011639/http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=45567|archive-date= October 26, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> In 2016 Dynamite released limited series ''Lords of the Jungle'' featuring Tarzan and [[Sheena, Queen of the Jungle|Sheena]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dynamite.com/htmlfiles/viewProduct.html?CAT=DF-Lords_of_The_Jungle|title=Dynamite\u00ae ''Lords Of The Jungle''|date=2016|website=[[Dynamite Entertainment|Dynamite.com]]|archive-url= https://archive.today/20200423223732/https://www.dynamite.com/htmlfiles/viewProduct.html?CAT=DF-Lords_of_The_Jungle|archive-date= April 23, 2020|url-status= live|df= mdy-all}}</ref><ref>Overstreet, p. 836</ref>\n\n====Other publishers====\nDuring the timespan of the original comic book series from Western, DC and Marvel, a number of other comic book projects from other publishers also appeared.\n\n[[Charlton Comics]] briefly published a Tarzan comic from December 1964 \u2013 July 1965 titled ''Jungle Tales of Tarzan'',<ref>Overstreet, p. 800</ref><ref>{{gcdb series|id= 1617|title= ''Jungle Tales of Tarzan''}}</ref> adapting stories from that Burroughs book, on the mistaken belief that the character was already in the [[public domain]] at that time.\n\nWatson-Guptill Publications published hardcover comic book versions of the first half of ''Tarzan of The Apes'' in 1972 and four stories from ''Jungle Tales of Tarzan'' in 1976. These were illustrated by Hogarth many years after he stopped doing the newspaper strip and had a level of penmanship rarely seen in comics or even illustrations. It had captions of text from the novel instead of speech balloons.\n\nBetween the periods when Marvel and Dark Horse held the licence to the character, Tarzan had no regular comic book publisher for a number of years. During this time [[Blackthorne Publishing]] published a four-issue ''Tarzan'' series in 1986, reprinting strips by Hogarth, Manning, Gil Kane, and Mike Grell.<ref>{{gcdb series|id= 3275|title= ''Tarzan'' (Blackthorne)}}</ref> \n\nIn 1992, [[Malibu Comics]] produced a five-issue miniseries entitled ''Tarzan the Warrior'', written by Mark Wheatley with art by Neil Vokes.<ref name=\"Overstreet\" /><ref>{{gcdb series|id= 35913|title= ''Tarzan the Warrior''}}</ref> The first issue included two covers with one featuring painted art by [[Simon Bisley]].<ref name=\"Overstreet\" /> This was followed by a three-issue miniserues entitled ''Tarzan: Love, Lies and the Lost City'' and then a 7-issue miniseries entitled ''Tarzan: The Beckoning'', with story and art by [[Thomas Yeates]].  It was reprinted in trade paperback by Dark Horse Comics in 2016.\n\nThere have been a number of minor appearance of Tarzan in comic books over the years. Though not mentioned by name, Tarzan is referenced in [[Alan Moore]]'s ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen]]''. Places and people from the original Tarzan novels are referred to, suggesting that Tarzan does or did exist in that universe.\n\nIn a 1999 ''[[The Phantom]]'' story, ''Lord of the Jungle'', the hero meets Edgar Rice Burroughs, and inspires him to create Tarzan.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.erbzine.com/mag8/0853.html|title= A New Kind of Burroughs Comic|first= Fredrik|last= Ekman|date= n.d.|website= Bill and Sue-On Hillman's ERBzine|archive-url= https://archive.today/20200423224246/https://www.erbzine.com/mag8/0853.html|archive-date= April 23, 2020|url-status= live|df= mdy-all}}</ref> [[Warren Ellis]]' ''[[Planetary (comics)|Planetary]]'' series has a [[pastiche]] of Tarzan named [[Lord Blackstock]].\n\nIn 1999, Dark Horse Comics published comics featuring the Disney version of the character from the [[Tarzan (1999 film)|1999 film]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://coa.inducks.org/character.php?c=Tarzan&view=3|title= ''Tarzan''|publisher= [[Inducks]]}}</ref><ref>Overstreet, p. 637</ref><ref>{{gcdb series|id= 41910|title= ''Disney's Tarzan''}}</ref>\n\nIn 2012, Edgar Rice Burroughs, Inc began publishing [[webcomic]]s on their official website including ''Tarzan'' by writer [[Roy Thomas]] and artist [[Tom Grindberg]] and ''Tarzan of The Apes'' by Roy Thomas, artist [[Pablo Marcos]], and colorist/letterer Oscar Gonzales. In October 2016, the ''Tarzan'' has to be drawn by Benito Gallego.\n\n===Europe===\n''Tarzan'' comics were the first publications banned by the [[Federal Department for Media Harmful to Young Persons]] of then-[[West Germany]] after its founding in 1954. The German ''Tarzan'' #34 and #35 of the monthly series were not allowed to be sold in the country because the department stated that they would affect young people in a \"nerve-inflaming and brutalising way\" and \"transport them into an unreal world of lies\". Such works were supposedly \"the result of a degenerate imagination\", which is considered an insult to the comics' illustrator at the time, [[John Celardo]].\n\nWestworld Publications in UK began by reprinting the bedsheet size version of [[Mondadori]]'s Italian and French editions which chiefly reprinted the Foster and Hogarth Sunday pages at roughly the size in which they had originally appeared. By the mid-1950s, Westworld produced a regular comic book size weekly and in 1957, under the editorship of teenaged [[Michael Moorcock]], ran features about other Burroughs characters as well as newly-created stories and strips with a strong Burroughs flavor. After Moorcock resigned, his 75-year-old assistant removed all references to Burroughs or his characters, as well as all fantasy or science-fiction content. The magazine folded around 1960.\n\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s, Tarzan comics was published in Greece by Dragounis Editions (\"Pidalio Press Corporation\").\n\nTarzan comics was produced from 1983 to 1989 by Marketprint in Yugoslavia. They were later translated and published in Sweden, Norway, Finland, Germany, the Netherlands and Denmark. There were over 100 published episodes, each of which had 16 pages. In most of them, [[Branislav Kerac]] was involved, either as the writer, penciller, inker or complete author.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.lambiek.net/artists/k/kerac_bane.htm|title= Bane Kerac|date= November 13, 2006|publisher= [[Lambiek|Lambiek Comiclopedia]]|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120728073902/http://www.lambiek.net/artists/k/kerac_bane.htm|archive-date= July 28, 2012|url-status=dead|access-date= October 7, 2012}}</ref> He was also responsible for \"The Kalonga Star,\" a five episode crossover between Tarzan and [[Kobra (comic book)|Kobra]]. Other notable episodes were \"Tarzan and Barbarians\", \"The Tiger\", \"The Boy from the Stars\" and \"Big Race.\"\n\nIn March 2021, the French publisher [[Soleil Productions]] published ''Tarzan,
