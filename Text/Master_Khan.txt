When Khan stole the [[Sons of the Tiger]]'s tiger talismans, he badly injured [[Bob Diamond (comics)|Bob Diamond]].<ref>''Power Man and Iron Fist'' #74.

Marvel Comics.</ref> While there, Iron Fist was secretly replaced by a doppelg\u00e4nger of the plantlike [[H'ylthri]] race, K'un-Lun's ancient enemies. Soon after their return to the outside world, the doppelg\u00e4nger is destroyed as a result of a bizarre scheme engineered by Master Khan.<ref>''Namor, the Sub-Mariner'' #15-25.

While in stasis with the H'ylthri, Rand managed to focus his chi, curing the cancer. Returning to Earth and investigating the apparent invasion of Earth by the H'ylthri, Namor was forced to fight their captive, [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]]. The battle was interrupted by Master Khan, who wiped Namor's memory and dumped him in the American Midwest.<ref>''Namor, the Sub-Mariner'' #25. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nNamor was missing for almost a year, until Namorita tracked him down using a psychic link to him she had recently discovered. Namor did not regain his memory until sometime afterward, when he was captured by [[Doctor Doom]]. The ship Doom had used to do so was then magically imprisoned in a bottle by Master Khan, who then assumed Namor's form and sold off much of Oracle's holdings. Namor soon broke the bottle and the spell, and killed Khan.<ref>''Namor, the Sub-Mariner'' #33. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nMaster Khan has magical powers that enable him to distort reality, levitate, and shrink objects and beings.  He can also alter his appearance, form shields, fire energy blasts. He calls on the mystic principalities, such as [[Cyttorak]], the Faltine, and [[Raggadorr]], for power.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Master_Khan_(Earth-616) Master Khan] at Marvel Wiki\n* {{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix2/masterkhankunlun.htm|Master Khan}}\n\n{{Iron Fist}}\n{{Namor}}\n{{Stan Lee}}\n{{Steve Ditko}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Khan, Master}}\n[[Category:Characters created by Chris Claremont]]\n[[Category:Characters created by John Byrne (comics)]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Stan Lee]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Steve Ditko]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1960]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters who use magic]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]"}]}}}}
