Thinking the creature dead, Phil had its body brought to the [[American Museum of Natural History]] in [[New York City]]. It is Phil who first names the creature \"Monsteroso\".\n\nAfter healing, Monsteroso revives in the museum. The young alien, confused by its surroundings began rampaging through the city. The police attempted to stop him with conventional force (i.e. bullets and tear gas), unsuccessfully. Meanwhile, Phil realizes that Monsteroso's nature was childlike, not evil, and he convinced an Army scientist to sedate, rather than kill, the creature. After scaling the [[United Nations]] building, it is successfully sedated, and falls into the [[East River]].<ref name=\"mnyc\">{{cite book | last = Sanderson | first = Peter | title = The Marvel Comics Guide to New York City | publisher = [[Pocket Books]] | year = 2007 | location = New York City | pages = 64\u201373 | isbn = 978-1-4165-3141-8}}</ref>\n\nImmediately afterwards, an enormous spacecraft lands, and two enormous aliens disembark, Monsteroso's parents.

Soon after his birth, Monsteroso began to uncontrollably grow in size, larger and larger, with no apparent upper limit. Eventually, Monsteroso dwarfed even massive geological features like mountains. Being so large, Monsteroso hailed himself as conqueror and ruler of all he surveyed, until a flood came in which Monsteroso drowned. The \"flood\" was subsequently revealed to be a scientist washing out a glass slide, utterly unaware of the microscopic ecosystem that had lived within it.<ref>''[[Tales to Astonish]]'' #18 (April 1961)</ref>\n\nIn later mentions in the Marvel Universe, this Monsteroso was said to be an inhabitant of the [[Microverse]].<ref>''The [[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe]]'' #7, ''s. v.'' \"Microverse\"</ref>\n\nThe first appearance of this Monsteroso was reprinted in ''[[Fantasy Masterpieces]]'' #9 (June 1967).\n\n==See also==\n* Monstro, a Marvel Comics monster also known as [[Giganto]].\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/monstero.htm|Monsteroso (Amazing Adventures)}}\n* {{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/mnstroso.htm|Monsteroso (Tales to Astonish)}}\n{{refend}}\n\n{{Stan Lee}}\n{{Jack Kirby}}\n{{Steve Ditko}}\n\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1961]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Jack Kirby]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Stan Lee]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Steve Ditko]]\n[[Category:Fictional monsters]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics aliens]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters with superhuman strength]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics extraterrestrial supervillains]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]"}]}}}}
