The Hulk believes Igor to have been responsible for his, the Hulk's, creation. Igor is put through a re-creation of the incident, which causes great distress. The Hulk easily defeats Perun and takes his weapons, using them to temporarily entrap Vostok. The confrontation ends in a stalemate, for Igor had gone mad with guilt and nobody was sure what to do.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' (vol. 2) #393 (May 1992).

His powers are seemingly derived from a force-belt similar to that of [[Thor (Ultimate Marvel character)|Thor]]. Like his mainstream Marvel counterpart, he carries a hammer and sickle (the latter of which was dropped by Gregory Stark for loss of Soviet symbolism, but decided to keep the hammer to be Fury's ''own'' Thor).<ref>''Ultimate Avengers 3'' #5.
