He was originally a historian and teacher, and an advisor to the President of the United States of America. He has a son Matthew, who fought in the Vietnam War only to be discharged after Matthew had a nervous breakdown due to the violence he witnessed in combat.\n\nA right-wing conservative, Power believed that the only way that world peace could be obtained would be if America conquered the world. But knowing that US government would never agree to such a strategy, Power decided that he would have to conquer the United States in order to bring about his world view.\n\nAdopting the name \"Professor Power\", the head of a subversive organization and the leader of an unnamed army of right-wing extremists. Power, working behind the scenes, assembled a group of telepaths which was used by his ally [[Morgan MacNeil Hardy]] to restructure American society, until Hardy was foiled by [[Captain America]].<ref>''Captain America'' #264</ref> [[August Masters]], also working on behalf of Power, was revealed as the head of a secret project involving telepaths.<ref>''Defenders'' #102</ref> Masters' men, posing as federal agents, captured [[Nighthawk (Marvel Comics)|Richmond]].<ref>''Defenders'' #104</ref> Masters attempted to launch this psionic attack against the U.S.S.R., but battled Captain America, [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]], and the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]].<ref>''Captain America'' #268; ''Defenders'' #106</ref>\n\nProfessor Power used robots to test the capabilities of [[Spider-Man]] and [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]].<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #117</ref> Aided by the [[Fixer (comics)|Fixer]], Power captured [[Professor X]] and attempted to add his mental powers to [[Mentallo]]'s. He then revealed to Xavier that his son had slipped into a catatonic state (due to his father's refusal to get his son psychological help) and that he had paid Mentallo to use his boosted power to forcibly restore his son to consciousness. <ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #118</ref> In the ensuing psychic battle though, Matthew was hit with a stray psychic blast, which permanently destroyed his shattered mind.\n\nDriven insane with rage, Powers ordered his mind transferred into his son's body (permanently erasing any remaining traces of his son's consciousness) and sought revenge against Xavier by plotting the murder of his students. Encased in a battle-suit, he battled Spider-Man and the [[Beast (comics)|Beast]].<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #124</ref>\n\nAs '''Number One''', Professor Power was also the founder of the third [[Secret Empire (organization)|Secret Empire]]. He sent Harridan, Seraph, and Cloud to abduct the [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]], but was foiled by the Defenders.<ref>''Defenders'' #123</ref> He sent [[Mad Dog (comics)|Mad Dog]] and [[Resistants|Mutant Force]] to disrupt the wedding of [[Daimon Hellstrom]] and [[Patsy Walker]], and they battled the Defenders.<ref>''Defenders'' #125</ref> Professor Power had double agents in the New York [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] headquarters free [[Gargantua (comics)|Leviathan]], Mad Dog, and Mutant Force from S.H.I.E.L.D. custody, and sent Leviathan against the Defenders.<ref>''Defenders'' #126</ref> Power was then revealed as a member of the Secret Empire, and sent [[Mandroid]]s to recapture the escaped Cloud.<ref>''Defenders'' #127</ref> Power captured the Defenders,<ref>''Defenders'' #128</ref> and unsuccessfully attempted to brainwash them into killing the [[New Mutants]] in revenge against Professor X. Power launched a subliminal mind-control satellite in an attempt to start World War III.<ref>''Defenders'' #129</ref> The satellite was destroyed, and his consciousness was telepathically merged with his son's by [[Moondragon]], resulting in catatonic madness.<ref>''Defenders'' #130</ref>\n\nSome time later, Power was abducted from S.H.I.E.L.D. custody and brought back to his castle in the Adirondack Mountains in New York State, and revived by his followers. Power by this point was starting to exhibit signs of his own mental breakdown, as life wearing his son's face took its toll on him emotionally. Sadly, in combat with  [[U.S. Agent (comics)|Captain America]] (John Walker), Powers was brutally beaten to death.<ref>''Captain America'' #338</ref>\n\nPower's corpse was again stolen by his followers, who resurrected him by way of converting his battle suit into a life-support system.{{Issue|date=March 2011}}  Professor Power has since continued fighting heroes, including [[Darkhawk]],{{Issue|date=March 2011}} [[Iron Man]],{{Issue|date=March 2011}} [[X-Men]],{{Issue|date=March 2011}} and [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]].{{Issue|date=March 2011}}\n\n===Civil War===\nProfessor Power is a self-confessed loser at the wake of [[Stilt-Man]], who had been killed by the [[Punisher]].

He is an excellent long-range planner, and battle strategist, and has degrees in history and political science.\n\nHis scientists designed for him a battle suit of full body armor capable of flight via jet engines attached to it, and an electron-beam (fired from his right forefinger).\n\nWhen Professor Power was in Matthew Power's body, he possessed superhuman strength.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix3/professorpowerdef.htm}}\n\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1982]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from Virginia]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]"}]}}}}
