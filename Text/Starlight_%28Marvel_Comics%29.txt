Tania became a young [[neurosurgeon]], though after her [[dissident]] father Andrei had been sent to [[Siberia]], she adopted a costume and persona similar to the original [[Red Guardian]]'s, and fought crime and protected dissidents in an attempt to reform Soviet society.  She left the USSR at the request of [[Doctor Strange]] to perform a brain transplant. She decided to stay in [[United States|America]] and join the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]] as an adventurer.<ref>''The Defenders'' #35</ref> She battled a [[Plantman|Plant Man]] simulacrum alongside Doctor Strange.<ref>''The Defenders'' #36</ref> She was teleported to another dimension alongside [[Luke Cage|Power Man]] and Doctor Strange, where she battled the original [[Eel (comics)|Eel]] and [[Porcupine (comics)|Porcupine]].<ref>''The Defenders'' #37-38</ref> She also battled an unnamed masked Soviet.<ref>''The Defenders'' #40</ref> She teamed with [[Valkyrie (Marvel Comics)|Valkyrie]] and [[Patsy Walker|Hellcat]] to battle Doctor Strange as the Red Rajah and [[Nighthawk (Marvel Comics)|Nighthawk]], [[Hulk]], and Power Man.<ref>''The Defenders'' #44-45</ref>\n\nDr. Belinsky was brought to the lab complex of Sergei Krylov, alias the \"[[Presence (Marvel Comics)|Presence]]\", a scientific [[genius]] who had become one of the most influential men behind the scenes of the Soviet government.<ref>''The Defenders'' #52</ref>  Sergei mentally dominated Tania, and used a [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl]]-like nuclear disaster to transform Tania into his super-powered thrall with nuclear powers.<ref>''The Defenders'' #53</ref> She battled the Defenders alongside the Presence, and then separated from him.<ref>''The Defenders'' #55</ref> She was later assigned to investigate the Presence's reappearance, and after battling a giant amoeba, she reunited with the Presence.<ref>''The Defenders'' #65</ref> Alongside the Presence, she encountered the Hulk, [[Darkstar (Marvel Comics)|Darkstar]], [[Crimson Dynamo]], [[Vanguard (Marvel Comics)|Vanguard]], [[Ursa Major (comics)|Ursa Major]], and [[Professor Phobos]]. She and the Presence left Earth since their radiation levels were too dangerous for them to remain.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #259</ref> Tania and Sergei were eventually revealed to be laboratory subjects on one of the [[Stranger (comics)|Stranger]]'s laboratory worlds.<ref>''Quasar'' #16</ref> After regaining their freedom, Tania took the name '''Starlight''', and returned to Earth with the Presence and [[Jack of Hearts (Marvel Comics)|Jack of Hearts]]. She battled [[Quasar (comics)|Quasar]] and the [[Fantastic Four]], and aided the Presence in his attempt to kill Eon, though she ultimately admitted only doing so because the Presence (the only person who could safely remain around her due to him making her radioactive) threatened to abandon her if she did not serve as his henchwoman and lover.<ref>''Quasar'' #19-20</ref> She was later seen battling Darkstar and the [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]].<ref>''Marvel Comics Presents'' #70</ref>\n\nTania was then seen in the company of the Presence as his cosmic companion during his attempts to conquer Russia by mutating its citizens and armies into radioactive zombie-like beings. This included some of the Avengers, who fell under his power. He was defeated by Thor and Firebird, who proved immune to the transformations and Tania offered to restore all those who had been transformed to normal.{{issue|date=May 2013}}\n\nLater Tania and the Presence aided the Avengers in battling [[Kang the Conqueror|Kang]]. The Presence was planning to capitalize on the chaos Kang had sown on Earth by attempting to conquer Russia again once he was defeated, but Tania refused to allow it and this time, it was Tania who threatened to desert him if he did so.{{issue|date=May 2013}}\n\nAt some point, after the Kang War, Starlight was able to reduce her radioactivity enough to reintegrate within society without fear of causing death to those around her. She later joins up with other Russian heroes to form the Protectorate, serving [[Immortus]] as palace guards against the [[Dire Wraiths]]. During this time, she falls in love with her teammate Vanguard.<ref>''Darkstar & the Winter Guard'' #2</ref> When the team manages to banish the Dire Wraith queen back to Limbo, Tania is sucked along with her.<ref>''Darkstar & the Winter Guard'' #3</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nAs a result of [[mutation]] from [[cobalt]] [[radiation]], Tania has [[superhuman strength]], [[endurance|stamina]], and [[:wikt:durability|durability]]. She can generate nuclear [[energy]] for [[flight]] at [[supersonic]] speeds, and to project radiation blasts. Starlight gives off low levels of [[radioactive decay|nuclear radiation]] at all times, putting normal human beings who associate with her for any length of [[time]] at risk.\n\nTania has a gifted [[intellect]], and is skilled at neurosurgery and medicine, with a PhD in [[medicine]]. She also has extensive [[experience]] in hand-to-hand [[combat]] and is a highly skilled athlete.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*http://www.marvel.com/universe/Red_Guardian_%28Tania_Belinsky%29\n*{{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix4/starlightredguard.htm|Starlight}}\n\n{{Defenders}}\n{{Steve Gerber}}\n\n[[Category:Characters created by Steve Gerber]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Sal Buscema]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1976]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1991]]\n[[Category:Fictional neurosurgeons]]\n[[Category:Fictional Soviet people]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters who can move at superhuman speeds]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters with superhuman strength]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics female superheroes]]\n[[Category:Soviet Union-themed superheroes]]"}]}}}}
