According to Kraft, he had been trying to link Lunatik to the ''Creatures on the Loose'' story arc during his time as writer on ''Defenders'', and his successor [[Ed Hannigan]] picked up on this, but made a different connection between the two than Kraft had had in mind.<ref name=\"Back65\">{{cite journal |last=DeAngelo|first=Daniel|date=July 2013|title=The Not-Ready-For-Super-Team Players: A History of the Defenders|journal=[[Back Issue!]]|issue=65|pages=3\u201316 |publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}</ref> [[Keith Giffen]] stated \"Lunatik was a character I came up with in high school. When it went radically wrong, I went to [[DC Comics|DC]] [Comics and] took the basic concept of Lunatik and ... split [it] into two characters: [[Lobo (DC Comics)|Lobo]] had his mercilessness, and [[Ambush Bug]] had his goofiness.\"<ref name=\"Back65\"/>\n\nThe character was created and designed in a hurry, when Giffen suddenly left Marvel to work for [[DC Comics]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Kraft |first1=David Anthony |title=Defenders Masterworks vol 6 |date=2018 |publisher=Marvel Enterprises |isbn=9781302504397 |chapter-url=https://www.google.com/books/edition/Defenders_Masterworks_Vol_6/2qFODwAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=lunatik+marvel&pg=PT9&printsec=frontcover |access-date=10 May 2020 |chapter=Introduction}}</ref>\n\nThe character subsequently appears in ''Defenders'' #51-53 (September-November 1977), #55-56 (January-February 1978), #61-62 (July-August 1978), #64-65 (October-November 1978), ''Marvel Premiere'' #45-46 (December 1978, February 1979), and ''Defenders'' #70-73 (April-July 1979). \n\nA different character named Lunatik appeared in ''[[Marvel Comics Presents]]'' #172-175 and ''Lunatik'' #1 (December 1995).\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nArisen Tyrk was the tyrannical god-king of the dimension called Other Realm. He seeks the power of the Godstone, which is bonded to [[John Jameson (comics)|John Jameson]] as the Man-Wolf. Tyrk hires [[Kraven the Hunter]] to attack Man-Wolf, but Man-Wolf fights Kraven off. Rebels from Other Realm bring the Man-Wolf to their land and he deposes Tyrk.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}\n\nTyrk tries to escape through an extra-dimensional portal, but the portal is damaged and fragments Tyrk into a number of forms in a number of realms. Four of Tyrk's fragments go to Earth, becoming the crazed Lunatik. These four duplicates of Tyrk plague the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]] until they re-merge Lunatik into a more-or-less-whole Tyrk. He fights the Defenders in this form, but they eventually defeat him.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}\n\nFor a time he poses as drama professor Harrison Turk at [[Empire State University]].<ref name=\"mnyc\">{{cite book |last=Sanderson |first=Peter |title=The Marvel Comics Guide to New York City |publisher=[[Pocket Books]] |date= 2007 |location=New York City |pages=30\u201333 |isbn=978-1-4165-3141-8}}</ref>\n\n==Other characters named Lunatik==\nThere is also a cosmic mercenary by the name of Lunatik. He kills one of Tyrk's fragments, claiming that he doesn't like anyone else \"using his name.\"{{issue|date=February 2013}} He first appeared in ''[[Marvel Comics Presents]]'' #172 (Jan 1995). This Lunatik is seen on a prison ship, the ''Dredge 01'', on its way to the [[Kyln]]. It crashes on Earth with [[Drax the Destroyer]], [[Paibok]], and the [[Blood Brothers (comics)|Blood Brothers]] as the only survivors. He seemingly meets his end at the Destroyer's hand.<ref>''Drax the Destroyer: Earthfall'' #1-4</ref>\n\nThis Lunatik or a possible fragment appeared (in another prison) as Dirty Wolff in ''[[Deadpool]]''.{{issue|date=February 2013}}\n\n==In other media==\nThe ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (TV series)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' episode \"Take the Milano and Run\" features a different Lunatik voiced by [[John DiMaggio]].
