First appearing in 1983, Katana is a samurai warrior whose skill with a sword allows her to fight for justice as a superheroine. Her tragic backstory includes the death of her husband, Maseo, whose soul becomes trapped in her blade, the Soultaker. Katana has been featured in various DC Comics superhero teams, including the [[Justice League]] and the [[Birds of Prey (comics)|Birds of Prey]], but is most commonly associated with the team known as [[Outsiders (comics)|the Outsiders]], a team of heroes hand-picked by [[Batman]] to act as his personal [[black ops]] team, handling riskier missions.\n\nIn the 2010s, DC began to feature the character much more extensively in media adaptations of its comic books, including a recurring role in the animated series ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' and then a starring role in the series ''[[Beware the Batman]]''. The character was adapted for live action in 2014, portrayed by [[Rila Fukushima]] during the third and fourth seasons of the [[ Arrowverse]] series ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'', and returned in the final season. The character made her feature film debut in the 2016 film ''[[Suicide Squad (2016 film)|Suicide Squad]]'', portrayed by actress [[Karen Fukuhara]], which is part of the [[DC Extended Universe]]. The character has also been featured in direct-to-video animated movies and a number of DC Comics video games.\n\n==Publication history==\nKatana first appeared in ''[[The Brave and the Bold]]'' #200 (cover-dated July 1983)<ref name=Guide>{{cite book|last1=Cowsill|first1=Alan|last2=Irvine|first2=Alex|last3=Korte|first3=Steve|last4=Manning|first4=Matt|last5=Wiacek|first5=Win|last6=Wilson|first6=Sven|title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia: The Definitive Guide to the Characters of the DC Universe|date=2016|publisher=DK Publishing|isbn=978-1-4654-5357-0|page=165}}</ref> and was created by writer [[Mike W.

Attempting to save her children, she hears her husband's voice coming from the sword, telling her they are already lost. Escaping with her life, Tatsu begins training as a samurai under a master called Tadashi. After much time, she graduates from his tutorship and leaves for America where she intends to use her talents to fight for justice.

Inspired by the teamwork he encounters between Black Lightning, Katana, Halo, [[Geo-Force]] (Prince Brion of Markovia), and [[Metamorpho]] (also coincidentally present), Batman decides to form the [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]].<ref>''Batman and the Outsiders'' #2 (Sept. 1983), p. 24.</ref> The team manages to end the Baron's tyranny in Markovia and moves to [[Gotham City]], where they set up their headquarters (a former penthouse of Bruce Wayne, secretly the Batman). Tatsu becomes Halo's guardian and the two move into the penthouse.\n\nAt the same time, Takeo is still at large and follows Tatsu to Gotham City. He attacks her and Halo at their home, overpowers Tatsu and switchs swords with her. He leaves for Tokyo with Tatsu on his tail. The Outsiders follow Tatsu and offer their help, despite her desire to leave them out of it. Takeo takes the sword to his master  [[Oyabun]], the godfather of the Yakuza. Performing a specific ritual, the Oyabun and Takeo call forth the souls that inhabit the sword and give them corporeal form.<ref name=\"Batout11\">''Batman and the Outsiders'' #11 (June 1984), pp. 20\u201323.</ref> Among them are legendary mercenaries and assassins, but also Maseo, who is now a slave to the Oyabun. Katana\u2014 and the Outsiders\u2014 have to fight them all, but she is ultimately able to reclaim the Soultaker from Maseo. She is forced to kill her husband, and then take the opportunity to kill Takeo, finally putting some of her ghosts to rest. Maseo and those killed a second time by the Soultaker pass on to their eternal rewards, leaving Takeo trapped in the sword in his place.\n\nAt one point the Outsiders split from Batman's leadership and take up residence in Markovia where they are funded by the Markovian crown (Geo-Force is a prince of the royal family). They become the official agents of Markovia and move to the city of [[Los Angeles]] and make their headquarters in the Markovian embassy, while retaining another secret HQ just off the shore. Although Tatsu left her past behind, the Oyabun return and send a [[tengu]] after her, with which he captures her. This mischievous spirit possesses her, and the Obayun is able to use her as an assassin. Her teammates Halo and [[Looker (comics)|Looker]] are able to save her using other tengu and the tengu leader, who aids them in battle.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.mykey3000.com/cosmicteams/outsiders/index.html | title=The Outsiders! | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060813070536/http://www.mykey3000.com/cosmicteams/outsiders/index.html | archive-date=2006-08-13}}</ref><ref>''Adventures of the Outsiders'' #34 (June 1986)</ref>\n\n===Family debt===\n[[File:KatanaShowcase.png|thumb|Katana from The Showcase: To The Hilt, in the cover of the comic book. Art by Lynne Yoshii, and Beth Sotelo ]]\nAfter various tragic events surrounding Geo-Force's parents and Markovia, the team disbands. Nonetheless the Outsiders are forced to defend Markovia against the Manhunters. During the fight, Halo is knocked into a coma, saving Katana's life. Bounded by ''giri-ninjo'' (a debt of honor even unto death), Tatsu leaves the team to tend to Halo's wounds. During that time, however, she is approached by a family member of her husband, who wishes her to accompany the [[Suicide Squad]] on a mission to destroy a large hoard of weapons that is about to be sold to the Yakuza. She declines on the basis of her ''giri-ninjo'', but is willing to help if the need is truly desperate. That family member is later killed, and she goes after the killer, the Daichi-Doku's Oyabun (of which her relative is a member), who does not wish to see the weapons destroyed and tries to stop the Suicide Squad. During that adventure, she saves the life of [[Bronze Tiger]] and [[Manhunter (comics)#Mark Shaw|Manhunter]] (Mark Shaw), making them honor-bound to her by ''giri-ninjo''. Mark Shaw then assists her in taking down the Daichi-Doku's Oyabun. The Oyabun commits ritual suicide and Katana stands by as his \"second\", ready to help with a blade strike so he can keep his honor.\n\n===Returning to the Outsiders===\nEventually, the Outsiders re-form and return to Markovia. Instead of a peaceful reunion, however, the team becomes trapped in a web of public relations that brand them outlaws. Although the charges are dropped eventually, the team is fractured. Halo dies from an assassin's blast but is reborn in a new body. This puts an immense strain on Tatsu's relationship with Halo. Katana joins a team with Geo-Force and [[Technocrat (comics)|Technocrat]], taking the lead. She develops a mild romantic relationship with Joey Hong, an Asian associate of [[Guy Gardner (comics)|Guy Gardner]].<ref>''Guy Gardner: Warrior'' #39 (February 1996)</ref> During a lone mission, her old mentor Tadashi sends [[Lady Shiva]] to claim Katana's Soultaker sword. Shiva confronts Katana, who is battling a gang of drug dealers. Katana slays many of them, but refuses to kill the youngest member, something Shiva insults her for. Shiva, renowned as the world's greatest assassin and fighter, kills Katana with her own sword. Katana returns to life after a trial by combat within her sword, which includes confronting many of the souls of the people she killed. Afterwards, she finds her old mentor and takes his life. The two splinter teams eventually reunite to take on more supernatural threats focused around the new team member [[Sebastian Faust]]. Katana and her friends suffer through the mental and physical tortures that Faust's father, [[Felix Faust|Felix]], put them through. Halo eventually frees them by destroying several of Felix's items of power. Soon after, the group breaks apart. After disbanding, Tatsu keeps her association with her old allies among the Outsiders (such as Black Lightning, Geo-Force, and Halo), and although they do not operate as an official team, they are always together during major crises. Her close ties to Batman also see her fighting by his side, several times, notably during the [[Imperiex]] crisis and the [[Day of Judgment (comics)|Day of Judgment]] incident when Hell invaded Earth. The main battle against the villain, the rogue angel Asmodel, with the power of the Spectre, takes place in New York. Katana personally protects [[Madame Xanadu]] who guards the rest of Asmodel's power with a mystical shield. Katana's protection of Xanadu is assisted by [[Doctor Occult]], [[Phantom Stranger]], and [[Alan Scott]]. Later, Katana assists Batman when he and [[Superman]] are declared outlaws. Katana is also called upon by [[Black Canary]], together with [[Birds of Prey (comics)|other female mercenaries]], in order to rescue [[Barbara Gordon|Oracle]] from Senator Pullman. After Oracle is saved, Katana receives a card, together with the promise of a favor if required. Katana later returns to aid Oracle in issue #108 alongside dozens of other agents.\n\n[[File:Outsiders 16 Cover.jpg|thumbnail|right|Katana as she appeared with the Outsiders in 2009]]\n\n===New Outsiders===\nLater Katana joins a new team of Outsiders after assisting them in defeating a more powerful [[Sabbac]]. That team consists of all new members, with the exception of [[Metamorpho]] who rejoins the team after [[Metamorpho#Shift|Shift's]] demise. In ''Outsiders'' (vol. 3) #42, Katana dons a new costume, as she feels it inappropriate to wear a costume based on Japan's flag, since the country revoked her citizenship due to her membership with the controversial team. Later, Katana summons Sabbac to destroy Dr. Sivana's base with his Hellfire. Katana remains an active member of the Outsiders following the 2006 \"[[One Year Later]]\" continuity jump. Initially, the team is led by [[Dick Grayson|Nightwing]], but later leadership transfers to Batman. Batman decides to 'test' Katana and the rest of the initial team, in order to design a better team. Katana is Batman's first official recruit.\n\n===\"Blackest Night\"===\n{{Main|Blackest Night}}\nWhile escorting [[Killer Croc]] to incarceration, the Outsiders' vehicle is demolished by Maseo, Yuki, and Reiko, who have all been revived as [[Black Lantern Corps|Black Lanterns]].

Realising the truth, she draws her sword, preparing to fight her undead husband.<ref>''Outsiders'' (vol. 4) #24</ref> When Katana stabs Maseo, Soultaker reveals to her the Black Lanterns' full intentions.

In this new continuity, a newly healed [[Barbara Gordon]] returns to the [[Batgirl]] identity and takes a leave of absence from the Birds of Prey<ref>''Birds of Prey'' (vol. 3) #1. DC Comics.</ref> and suggests that Katana take her place full-time on the team.\n\nKatana joins [[Black Canary]] and Starling as the third member of the [[Birds of Prey (comics)|Birds of Prey]]. Katana is described as a lethal fighter who has spent the last year waging war on the Yakuza clan that is responsible for the death of her husband. She is rumored to be mentally unstable due to her belief that her husband's soul, whom she often converses with in Japanese, resides in her sword.<ref>''Birds of Prey'' (vol. 3) #2</ref>\n\nAfter a number of adventures with the Birds of Prey, Katana leaves the group in order to keep an eye on a cult of assassins known as the Daggers.<ref>''Birds of Prey'' (vol. 3) #15.

DC Comics.</ref> When DC launched ''Justice League of America'', they also launched the solo series ''Katana'', focusing on Tatsu's abiding mission to track down her husband's killer. The series lasted 10 issues. After this, Katana made an appearance in ''Green Arrow'' (vol. 5) #27 (2014), where she is told by the mysterious blind man Magus that the death of her husband relates to the Outsiders, the society formed of various weapon clans and connected to Green Arrow's new origin story. The Soultaker is worked into the Green Arrow mythology as the totem of the Sword Clan, which has parallels in the Fist, Mask, Shield, Axe, Arrow, and Spear Clans. Representatives from each of these clans make up the Outsiders, a secret society dedicated towards ending global corruption, but which is itself largely corrupt. Katana joins the Outsiders. In ''Green Arrow: Futures End'' #1 (2014), set five years later in [[The New 52: Futures End|one possible future]], Tatsu is shown to still be a member of the Outsiders, which has developed a grudging relationship with Green Arrow, who rejected leadership of the Arrow Clan in the main ''Green Arrow'' series five years before.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n===DC Rebirth===\nAmanda Waller recruits Katana to be a co-captain of the Suicide Squad. Later, she joins the latest iteration of The Outsiders.\n\n==Powers, abilities, and weapons==\nKatana is a highly proficient hand-to-hand combatant and swordswoman, having studied martial arts as a child and later being trained by the samurai Tadashi. From her time with the Outsiders and Batman, she develops strong tactical skills.\n\nKatana's Soultaker sword, along with its non-powered twin, is forged in the 14th century by [[Muramasa]], whose swords are said to be cursed and make those who are evil commit evil acts. It sometimes takes the souls of those it kills, storing them inside the sword, where they can engage in limited communication with whoever wields it. \nThese souls and spirits can be freely reborn/reincarnated by the means of a sacred ritual, under which they serve their summoner, even if it is against their will. Its cutting edge is sharp enough to rend the [[Captain Atom#Dilustel|Dilustel]] skin of Captain Atom and [[Major Force]].<ref>''Superman/Batman'' #4</ref> In The New 52, the Soultaker is established as being the 'Sword Totem' of the Outsiders, meaning like the other totems, it supposedly bestows immortality and enlightenment upon its wielder, although some like Green Arrow are skeptical of the literal truths of these statements.\n\nIn addition to the Soultaker, Katana often carries additional weaponry into battle.\n\n==Other versions==\n* In the alternate timeline of the 2011 \"[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]\" storyline, Katana joins with the [[Amazons (DC Comics)|Amazons]]' [[Female Furies|Furies]].<ref>''Flashpoint: Wonder Woman and the Furies'' #2 (July 2011).

In the episode \"Enter the Outsiders!\", she is shown as a member of the Outsiders alongside Black Lightning and Metamorpho, as teenagers rather new to their abilities. They serve the sewer-dwelling villain [[Sleez|Slug]] until Batman and Wildcat defeat him and persuade them not to follow Slug's ways. In \"Inside the Outsiders!\", Katana is revealed to have been the student of Tadashi, who was killed by the evil samurai Takeo. Psycho-Pirate makes her believe that it was her talkative nature that led Takeo to Tadashi, and she becomes silent out of shame. Batman reminds her that this was not what happened, as Tadashi sacrificed himself to make her a greater warrior, and her silence honors his teachings of self-control. In the teaser of \"Requiem for a Scarlet Speedster\", Katana and the Outsiders, along with new members [[Geo-Force]] and [[Halo (DC Comics)|Halo]] work with Batman to stop [[Kobra (DC Comics)|Kobra]] and his cultists' plan for world domination.

[[Alfred Pennyworth]] was a friend of her father during their MI-6 days, and later became Tatsu's godfather. Tatsu agrees to serve as Bruce Wayne's bodyguard while Alfred is recovering from injuries. When she becomes a crime fighter by Batman's side, she uses her League codename, Katana, so they will know who defeated them. According to producer [[Glen Murakami]], Tatsu would have become the show's version of Nightwing if season two were made. \n* Katana appears in ''[[Young Justice: Outsiders]]'', initially as a member of the Justice League before she resigns in a pre-planned move alongside Batman to operate as vigilantes.\n* Katana appears in the ''[[DC Super Hero Girls (TV series)|DC Super Hero Girls]]'' episode \"#SoulSisters\", voiced by [[Rina Hoshino]]. This version starts out as a ruthless vigilante who uses the soul-taker sword to steal the souls of criminals rather than capturing them. As Tatsu Yamashiro, she enrolls in Metropolis High and becomes fast friends with [[Diana Prince]] during a [[fencing]] match with her. After stealing the souls of various supervillains, she confronts the Super Hero Girls, who she deems evil for wanting to help the villains and proceeds to take all their souls besides Wonder Woman. When both Tatsu and Diana learn each-other's identities, they fight and argue about their methods until Diana sacrifices her soul to defend an innocent man who Tatsu mistakes as a car-thief.
