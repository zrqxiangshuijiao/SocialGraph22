Created by writers [[Grant Morrison]] and [[Mark Millar]], and artist [[Ron Wagner]], the character had cameos in ''The Flash'' vol. 2 #138 (June 1998),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comics.org/details.lasso?id=61784 |title=''Flash'' #138 at the Grand Comics Database |publisher=Comics.org |access-date=2011-04-25}}</ref> before appearing in full in ''The Flash'' vol. 2 #141 (September 1998).\n\n==Fictional character background==\n=== Original depiction ===\nThe Black Flash essentially fulfills the same role as [[Death (DC Comics)|Death]] for those who possess super-speed in the DC Universe, returning the speedster to their power source: the [[Speed Force]]. It is reportedly seen before the deaths of [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]] and [[Johnny Quick]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} [[Max Mercury]], having had several near-death experiences, has also seen the Black Flash.\n\nIt came for [[Wally West]] to draw back to the Speed Force, but instead took [[Linda Park (comics)|Linda Park]]. Having seen portents of Wally's death, Max Mercury and [[Jesse Quick]] intercepted Wally before reaching the museum where Linda was waiting, with Linda thus being struck by the lightning that was meant to kill Wally. It later returns to try to take Wally again, freezing time except for those who possess a connection to the Speed Force. Max Mercury, [[Flash (Jay Garrick)|Jay Garrick]], and Jesse Quick all attempt to assist Wally by distracting the Black Flash; Wally finally defeats the Black Flash by racing the creature to the end of time, to a point where Death would have no meaning, causing the creature to dissipate.\n\nThe Black Flash appears to [[Bart Allen]] when the Flash loses his powers while battling the Rogues at the [[Getty Center]]. Despite a clash with [[Inertia (DC Comics)|Inertia]] (another possible candidate for the Black Flash), Bart is killed shortly thereafter by the panicked Rogues when it appears Bart would win, even without powers.\n\nMost recently, the Black Flash is revealed to represent the dark aspect of the Speed Force, which is responsible for the empowerment of Wally's children. His connection to death is limited to those connected to the Speed Force. While an issue{{Issue|date=April 2009}} of ''[[Captain Atom]]'' suggests Death of the Endless, the Black Racer, and Nekron are all aspects of the same force, [[Neil Gaiman]] (creator of Death of the Endless) disagrees with this idea, stating that his creation is the ultimate personification of Death.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}\n\nDuring the ''[[Final Crisis]]'', Wally theorizes that the [[Black Racer (DC Comics)|Black Racer]] pursuing himself and Barry is in fact the Black Flash.\n\nA charred corpse, appearing to be the Black Flash, was found in [[Iowa]] by two boys in ''[[The Flash: Rebirth]]''.<ref>''The Flash: Rebirth'' #1 (April 2009)</ref>\n\nWhen the Force Barrier was destroyed and the other forces were unleashed, the Black Flash was sent to hunt down the conduits of the unleashed forces. The Black Flash arrives in the Speed Lab within the Flash Museum and attacks Steadfast, the Still Force avatar.<ref>''The Flash'' vol 5. #76 (August 2019)</ref> After [[Hunter Zolomon]] (now as \"The Flash\") takes Barry into the timestream (called the \"Forever Force\") built by the Speed Force, the Black Flash continues to chase them in order to kill them (in the hopes of healing the Speed Force). Hunter sacrifices himself to the Force Barrier in order to finally heal the Speed Force and keep the Black Flash from going after Steadfast and Fuerza, as he had already killed Psych. Due to the sacrifice, the Forever Force broken down trapping the Black Flash inside, while Barry escaped. <ref>{{Cite book|title=The Flash vol 5. #81|last=Williamson|first=Joshua|publisher=DC|year=2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Barry Allen ===\n{{main|Flash (Barry Allen)}}\nLater when discovering the body, '''[[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]]''' is transformed into the next Black Flash, but the state is reversed.<ref>''The Flash: Rebirth'' #2 (May 2009)</ref> It's revealed that Professor Zoom has altered the Speed Force which results in Barry's Black Flash transformation.<ref>''The Flash: Rebirth'' #3 (June 2009)</ref><ref>''The Flash: Rebirth'' #4 (August 2009)</ref>\n\n=== Eobard Thawne ===\n{{main|Eobard Thawne}}\nThe broken-necked corpse of '''[[Eobard Thawne]]''' is reanimated as a member of the [[Black Lantern Corps]].

It's learned that the Black Flash needs the souls of both Impulse and the retired [[Jay Garrick]] as they belong to the Speed Force. As Bart is the fastest usurping Jay as he's given up trying to battle the Black Flash, the demon craves his speed more. In the final battle over [[Las Vegas]], Impulse gives the demon his full speed and that ends up killing them both, leaving the classic Flash symbol in the desert.<ref>''Smallville Season 11'' #12</ref>\n\n==In other media==\n===Television===\nAn adapted depiction of the Black Flash appears in TV series set in the [[Arrowverse]].\n* Introduced in [[The Flash (season 2)|season two]] of ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/25/the-flash-the-race-of-his-life-review|title=The Flash: \"The Race of His Life\" Review|date=May 24, 2016|access-date=July 21, 2016}}</ref> this version was originally '''[[Hunter Zolomon (Arrowverse)|Hunter Zolomon / Zoom]]''' (portrayed by [[Teddy Sears]]), who is transformed by Time Wraiths to serve as the Speed Force's Grim Reaper-esque enforcer by hunting down speedsters who attempt to change the timeline and erase them from existence.

This prompts Thawne to form the [[Legion of Doom]] and locate the [[Spear of Destiny]] to change reality and save himself. After succeeding in his plans, Thawne traps the Black Flash in [[S.T.A.R.
