She first met the feral mutant Wolverine when the X-Men sought the help of her cousin, the Japanese mutant hero Sunfire. Although initially frightened by the ferocious-looking Wolverine, Mariko found herself attracted to him. Similarly, Wolverine was charmed by her beauty and refined manner. The two spent a great deal of time together in Japan, ultimately falling in love when she visited him in New York. To settle a [[consumer debt|personal debt]] incurred during his rise to power, Shingen forced his daughter [[Mariko Yashida]] to marry criminal boss Noboru Hideki.<ref name=\"Wolverine #1\">''Wolverine'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] found out Noboru beat Mariko nearly to death and confronted Noboru but relented from killing him upon Mariko's insistence. Shingen had Wolverine poisoned, temporarily weakening him so that Shingen could beat and humiliate the superhuman [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] in a duel with [[bokken]] in front of Mariko. Shingen used his expert knowledge of human anatomy to secretly attack Wolverine's nerve endings in such a way so as to make the duel life-threatening. But as Mariko did not know this, when Wolverine attempted to use his claws to save himself, it appeared to Mariko that Wolverine was cheating. Mariko did not know that Wolverine's body had been saturated with enough lethal poison to kill several dozen ordinary men, or that Shingen was the one who was actually cheating in the duel. This had the effect of disgracing Wolverine in front of her, which was the design of Shingen.<ref>''Wolverine'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> Logan was then dumped onto the Tokyo streets and found by [[Yukio (comics)|Yukio]], Shingen's best assassin, who participated in deception with the [[The Hand (comics)|Hand]] ninja clan to manipulate Wolverine into assassinating a rival crime lord, using Mariko as unwitting bait for additional motivation. After his role was completed, Shingen ordered Logan killed, but Yukio ignored the order. This led to the Hand being sent to enforce his will. In the events resulting from that action, including the death of a personal friend by Yukio, Wolverine realized that Yukio was the one who poisoned him at Shingen's residence and was being played for a fool at apparently Shingen's orders.<ref>''Wolverine'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> After a philosophic epiphany about humanity, Logan then completely destroyed the Yashida criminal empire and confronted Shingen a second time. Shingen did not survive the confrontation. Mariko revealed she'd planned to kill her dishonorable father personally then commit [[seppuku]] in recompense had not Logan prevented her. Afterward, Mariko and Wolverine decided to marry, with the [[X-Men]] receiving an invitation from the [[Emperor of Japan]] for the event.<ref>''Wolverine'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref> \n\nIt is later revealed that his illegitimate son [[Kenuichio Harada]] wanted to inherit Shingen's position.<ref>''The New Mutants'' #6.

Marvel Comics.</ref> \n\nShingen was briefly resurrected by Phaedra of the [[The Hand (comics)|Hand]] as part of a campaign of revenge against Wolverine.<ref>''Wolverine'' vol. 3 #61. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nLord Shingen had no superhuman abilities but was in peak physical condition despite his age, and he was one of the finest swordsmen and martial artists in all of Japan. Highly intelligent, he had extensive knowledge of human anatomy, pressure points, and great knowledge of poisons and assassination techniques. Shingen was highly skilled in the management of criminal organizations and very well connected in the international criminal underworld, particularly in areas of drug traffic.\n\n==Other versions==\nIn the comic series ''[[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]]'', a younger version of Shingen Yashida exists in the home reality of Mariko Yashida (aka Sunfire).<ref>''Exiles'' #7. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n==In other media==\n* Lord Shingen appears in the anime television series ''[[Marvel Anime|Marvel Anime: Wolverine]]'', voiced by [[Hidekatsu Shibata]] in the Japanese version and by [[Fred Tatasciore]] in the English dub. This version is the leader of the Kuzury\u016b syndicate. He arranges for [[Mariko Yashida]] to be married to Hideki Kurohage of [[Madripoor]], with the series focusing on [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] working to prevent the marriage. In a last-ditch attempt to stop him, Shingen dons special armor to battle Wolverine, but is killed by the latter and [[Yukio (comics)|Yukio]].\n* Shingen Yashida appears in the live-action film ''[[The Wolverine (film)|The Wolverine]]'' (2013), portrayed by [[Hiroyuki Sanada]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Hoare|first=James|title=THE WOLVERINE'S HIROYUKI SANADA ON SHINGEN AND SAMURAI|url=http://www.scifinow.co.uk/news/the-wolverines-hiroyuki-sanada-on-shingen-and-samurai-films/|work=Movies|date=12 July 2013 |publisher=SciFiNow UK|access-date=12 July 2013}}</ref> This version is similar to the comics as he is the father of Mariko Yashida but  also the son of billionaire [[Ichiro Yashida|Ichir\u014d Yashida]] and the foster brother of Yukio. After the Yashidas' technology empire is left to Mariko despite Shingen's attempts to cover up his father's near-bankruptcy, Shingen grows hateful of Ichir\u014d and conspires with Japan's Minister of Justice, Noburo Mori, and the [[Yakuza]] to kill Mariko for taking what he saw as his and gain his father's admiration. He also contemptuous of [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|Mutant]]s. After he is poisoned by [[Viper (Madame Hydra)|Viper]], Shingen dons the Yashida Clan's [[Silver Samurai|traditional samurai armor]] and attacks Yukio, but is killed by [[Logan (film series character)|Logan]].\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix4/harada_shingen.htm Shingen Yashida] at Marvel Appendix\n* [http://marvel.wikia.com/Shingen_Harada_%28Shin%29_%28Earth-616%29 Silver Samurai II] at Marvel Wiki\n* [http://www.comicvine.com/silver-samurai/4005-82249/ Silver Samurai II] at Comic Vine\n\n{{Wolverine}}\n{{Frank Miller}}\n\n[[Category:Characters created by Chris Claremont]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Frank Miller (comics)]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1982]]\n[[Category:Fictional Japanese people]]\n[[Category:Fictional yakuza]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics martial artists]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]\n[[Category:Superhero film characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional swordfighters in comics]]\n[[Category:Wolverine (comics) characters]]\n[[Category:X-Men supporting characters]]"}]}}}}
