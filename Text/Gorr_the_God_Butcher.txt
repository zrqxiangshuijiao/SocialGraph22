Gorr first appeared in ''[[Thor: God of Thunder (comics)|Thor: God of Thunder]]'' #1 (January 2013).<ref>{{cite book |last1=DeFalco |first1=Tom |last2=Sanderson |first2=Peter |last3=Brevoort |first3=Tom |last4=Teitelbaum |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |last6=Darling |first6=Andrew |last7=Forbeck |first7=Matt |last8=Cowsill |first8=Alan |last9=Bray |first9=Adam |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia |date=2019 |publisher=[[DK (publisher)|DK Publishing]] |isbn=978-1-4654-7890-0 |page=154}}</ref>\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nGorr grew up on a nameless barren planet where earthquakes, lack of water, and wild animals are common. No gods helped his people, but they still trusted blindly in their faith. When his mother, mate, and children died, he thought gods could not exist, and because of that, he was outcast by his tribe. When he learned gods did exist but did not help those in need, such as his dying family, he vowed to kill them all. He then acquired All-Black the Necrosword from [[Knull (character)|Knull]] after witnessing Knull in combat with a golden god.<ref>''Thor: God of Thunder'' #6. Marvel Comics.</ref><ref name=\"Venom #4\">''Venom'' (vol. 4) #4. Marvel Comics.</ref> He eventually finds young [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor Odinson]] on Earth in [[Medieval]] [[Iceland]]. He nearly killed the God of Thunder, but a band of [[Vikings]] came to assist him in their battle. While Gorr escaped with his arm cut off, he soon learned he needed help, so he created an army of shadow berserkers, then slowly and quietly eliminated more and more gods. Eventually, in the present day, Thor noticed the missing gods and investigated their disappearances. This brought Gorr and Thor to another battle, but Gorr then teleported into the future, spending centuries resuming his campaign against the gods. By the time Thor followed Gorr into the future, his [[Alternative versions of Thor (Marvel Comics)#King Thor|aged counterpart]] was the last Asgardian defending the realm against the shadow berserkers. Gorr also brings the young Thor into the future, where his wife and children have seemingly been resurrected, as he is about to set off the Godbomb, wanting to force the Thor who originally defeated him to witness the results of his efforts. Young Thor escapes and joins forces with his other selves to mount a new attack, but this assault fails and all three Thors are captured. However, when Gorr kills his wife for calling him her god, Gorr's \"son\", actually a construct made out of All-Black the Necrosword, releases Thor the Avenger from captivity and asks him to kill his father, observing that the man his father was once would be horrified at what he has become. As Thor dives into the heart of the Godbomb wielding both his Mjolnir and the Mjolnir of his older self, the prayers of all the gods from across time give Thor the power to absorb the blast. Thor from the present then uses the two Mjolnirs to kill Gorr.<ref>''Thor: God of Thunder'' #11 (October 2013). Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nGorr's legacy returns to haunt Thor when [[Nick Fury]] \u2013 currently wielding the eye and knowledge of the murdered [[Uatu]] following the \"[[Original Sin (comics)|Original Sin]]\" storyline \u2013 whispers a secret to him that causes Thor to lose the ability to wield his hammer. After spending months tormented by that secret, refusing to share it with anyone else, Thor finally reveals to [[Beta Ray Bill]] that the secret was \"Gorr was right\", affirming to Bill that he now believes that Gorr was correct that the universe would have been better without gods. Despite that, Bill assures Thor that his willingness to keep fighting for others even without his hammer shows that he is more than a god.<ref>''The Unworthy Thor'' #5.

In addition, it was the Necrosword who chose him as its wielder in retaliation for losing his daughter Love (portrayed by India Hemsworth) and his prayers to his god Rapu being left unanswered, corrupting him. In his quest to kill all gods, he attacks [[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thor]] and steals his axe [[Stormbreaker (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Stormbreaker]] to reach [[Eternity (comics)|Eternity]], despite the Necrosword slowly killing him. After [[Jane Foster (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Jane Foster / Mighty Thor]] destroys the Necrosword and a final battle with Thor, Gorr, freed of its influence, sees the error of his ways, and asks Eternity to bring Love back before he dies.
