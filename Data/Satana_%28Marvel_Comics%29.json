Created by [[Roy Thomas]] and [[John Romita Sr.]], she first appeared in ''[[Vampire Tales]]'' #2 (October 1973). Satana belongs to the subspecies of magical beings called [[Demon|demons]], who are born with supernatural abilities, as a human-succubus hybrid. She is the sister of [[Daimon Hellstrom]] and the daughter of Marduk Kurios.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Markstein |first1=Don |website=Don Markstein's Toonopedia |access-date=2 April 2020  |url=http://www.toonopedia.com/satana.htm |title=Satana}}</ref>\n\nSatana, renamed '''Ana''', made her live-action debut in the [[Hulu]] television series ''[[Helstrom (TV series)|Helstrom]]'', played by [[Sydney Lemmon]].\n\n==Publication history==\n{{expand-section|date=April 2020}}\nSatana made her debut in ''[[Vampire Tales]]'' #2 ([[cover-date]]d October 1973). She was created by [[Roy Thomas]] and [[John Romita Sr.]]<ref name=\"Nerdistsatana\" />\n\nShe appeared as a regular character in ''Thunderbolts'' since issue #155, and remained with the team when the title transitioned into ''[[Dark Avengers]]'' beginning with issue #175.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nSatana and Daimon were born in the fictional town of Greentown, [[Massachusetts]]. They were the half-human children of [[Satan]] (their father was later [[retcon]]ned into a demon named [[Marduk Kurios]],<ref>''Hellstorm: Prince of Lies'' #12</ref> who posed as Satan). Satana and her brother were groomed by their father to be evil, but [[Daimon Hellstrom|Daimon]] rejected these teachings, while Satana [[Theistic Satanism|embraced]] them.\n\nWhen Satana was still a child, her mother, Victoria Wingate, discovered her husband and children's true nature and was driven mad. Daimon was raised by servants, while Satana was taken to her father's particular [[Hell]]-dimension (of which there are many in the [[Marvel Universe]]) and taught [[black magic]]. As a reward for her devotion to him, Satana's father gave her a [[Familiar spirit|familiar]] named Exiter, with whom she formed a close bond. Satana began studying magic under her father and the demon Dansker. In Hell, her soul was bonded with an evil spirit called the '''Basilisk''' (not to be confused with the [[Basilisk (comics)#Basilisk (Basil Elks)|Basilisk]]) in order to increase her magical power.<ref>birth and childhood recounted in ''Marvel Spotlight'' #13</ref>\n\nAs an adult, Satana was banished to Earth by the Four as a [[succubus]], draining the souls of men. When she does this, the victim's soul transforms into an ethereal butterfly; Satana then consumes its essence by eating it. She also possesses the ability to gain strength through the use of weapons that were used to kill a living being. In order to do this, she merely places a portion of her own blood on the chosen weapon. She used both her magic and sexual wiles to get the victims she needed.\n\n[[Image:DeodatoSatana.jpg|left|thumb|Satana from the ''[[Witches (Marvel Comics)|Witches]]'' series, drawn by [[Mike Deodato]]]]\nAs a succubus, she stalked victims in New York City, and then in Los Angeles she befriended a Satanist named Ruth Cummins. When Ruth was killed, Satana avenged Ruth's death by destroying Darkos Edge and Harry Gotham.<ref>''Vampire Tales'' #2-3</ref> She later battled the Four, a mystic cabal. During Satana's first time in the mortal dimension, she was attacked by Monsignor Jimmy Cruz and his band of soldiers. During this battle, Cruz summoned demons called the [[N'Garai]]. Exiter tried to fend them off, but was killed trying to protect his mistress. Though she was too late to save her beloved Exiter, Satana gained her revenge by killing Cruz and consuming his soul.<ref>''Haunt of Horror'' #2, 4</ref> She confronted her father, who was disguised as Miles Gorney, and defied him by saving Michael Heron's soul from him.<ref>''Haunt of Horror'' #5</ref> Some time later, Satana was seemingly destroyed by her brother Daimon Hellstrom, but she defeated the demoness Kthara.<ref>''Marvel Spotlight'' #24</ref> She was transformed by the Camarilla of the N'Garai into a human, Judith Camber. She was restored to normal, and destroyed the Camarilla.<ref>''Marvel Preview'' #7</ref>\n\nEventually, however, the demon to which she had been bonded began to desire its freedom. The Basilisk managed to put a [[curse]] on [[Doctor Strange]], basically turning him into a [[werewolf]]. With the help of [[Spider-Man]], Satana was able to free Strange's soul from the curse, but the Basilisk was released in the process, and stabbed her in the back with a mystical blade. Satana died laughing, however, because their life-forces were still bound together; by killing her, the Basilisk had sealed its own fate as well. She had thus sacrificed her life to cure Strange of lycanthropy.<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #81</ref>\n\nAs a supernatural being, however, Satana's death was not permanent. Her spirit returned to her father's realm of Hell for a time, until she and a cabal of demons arranged to have her soul (among others) placed into a soulless body on Earth. There she began to build her powers again, preparing to return to Hell and conquer her father's realm.<ref>''Hellstorm: Prince of Lies'' #8, 10, 12, 20 and 21</ref>\n\nAt some point, she apparently died again. In the short-lived Marvel series ''[[Witches (Marvel Comics)|Witches]]'', Satana is resurrected again by Doctor Strange and teamed with two other magic-wielding females to defeat a powerful mystic enemy called the Hellphyr, which was a front for her father Marduk Kurios. According to that series, the three witches formed a coven in order to protect the ''Tome of Zhered-na'' (a powerful [[Book of Shadows]] belonging to the Kale family) from would-be thieves such as Doctor Strange.<ref>''Witches'' #1-4</ref>\n\nAfter a brief cameo in ''[[Nick Fury]]'s [[Nick Fury's Howling Commandos|Howling Commandos]]'',<ref>''Nick Fury's Howling Commandos'' #6</ref> Satana has been shown to have reverted to her former wicked ways; reaping souls in Manhattan and plotting her father's overthrow from the comfort of a desecrated church. Despite her fatherly conflict, Satana revealed that for every mortal victim she takes, she must offer the 10th victim as supplication to her father.<ref>''Legion of Monsters: Satana'' #1</ref> The [[Hood (comics)|Hood]] seeks her out to find out more information about Dormammu.<ref>''Dark Reign: The Hood'' #2</ref> Some time after the fall of the Hood, Luke Cage and Doctor Strange attempt to apprehend her for working with the Hood and to get her to join the Thunderbolts. She is initially resistant, but happily agrees when she realizes she will get to work with the [[Man-Thing]].<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #155</ref>\n\nIn the course of Marvel's ''Deadpool Team-Up'' series, Satana loses her soul to four geeks in a high-stakes poker game,<ref name=\"Deadpool-Team-Up-892\">{{Cite comic| writer = [[David Lapham]]| penciller = Shawn Crystal | title = [[Deadpool Team-Up]]| issue = #892| date = June 2010| publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]| location = [[New York, NY]]}}</ref> and she subsequently seeks out Deadpool's help to get it back.<ref name=\"Deadpool-Team-Up-892\" /> Deadpool discovers the poker-playing geeks are actually demons debating which will marry Satana to become the heir to Hell.<ref name=\"Deadpool-Team-Up-892\" /> Deadpool comes up with a plan to swindle Satana's soul back from the demons: he marries her, binding their souls together.

When the demon comes to take Satana as his bride, Deadpool produces the marriage certificate, denying the demon his bride.<ref name=\"Deadpool-Team-Up-892\" /> The demon then points out the loophole\u2014marriage is only valid until death; therefore, he decides to kill Deadpool.<ref name=\"Deadpool-Team-Up-892\" /> In the ensuing battle, Deadpool uses his soul-enhanced swords to easily dispatch the demon.<ref name=\"Deadpool-Team-Up-892\" /> Afterwards, Satana slips off and leaves Deadpool a letter explaining the inevitable divorce.<ref name=\"Deadpool-Team-Up-892\" /> She indicates she will be keeping half his soul\u2014her entitlement in the divorce settlement.<ref name=\"Deadpool-Team-Up-892\" />\n\nShe later was involved in a battle with several Hell-lords, attempting to take control of new territories within Hell.<ref>''X-Factor'' Vol. 2 #250-256</ref> She was killed in battle by the mutant / Asgardian god hybrid Tier.<ref>''X-Factor'' Vol. 2 #256</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\n[[Image:Satana.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Satana from ''[[Vampire Tales]]'' #3, drawn by [[Esteban Maroto]].]]Satana is a half-demon/half-human hybrid, and a [[succubus]]; she has some innate mystical abilities inherited from her father, as well as some that her father granted to her.

More of an anti-hero, Satana comes from a Hellish background. With demon parents, not only does Satana carry with her satanic powers, but she is often mistrusted because of her origins.
