Stardust is one of the many [[Herald of Galactus|Heralds of Galactus]]. Unlike most of Galactus's Heralds, Stardust seeks to kill all who attempt to escape the planets that Galactus feeds upon, an action that Galactus neither requires nor forbids.\n\nThis Stardust should not be confused with the other Marvel character known as Stardust, a former enemy of [[Rom the Spaceknight]].<ref>{{cite book |last =Rovin |first =Jeff |title =The Encyclopedia of Supervillains |publisher =Facts on File |date =1987 |location =New York |isbn = 0-8160-1356-X |page=328}}</ref>\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nThe Ethereal Lambda-Zero, who later became known as Stardust, the Herald of Galactus, was first introduced in the comics series ''[[Beta Ray Bill|Stormbreaker]]: The Saga of [[Beta Ray Bill]]''. The first planet Stardust fed to Galactus was New Korbin, after she slaughtered most of the planet's inhabitants.{{issue|date=December 2012}}\n\nThis led to a series of confrontation with Beta Ray Bill, who was busy attempting to rescue the Korbinites. The two fought each other, and after the first confrontation, Stardust sought out Bill after he obtained the Meta-Orb. Planning on crushing Bill with it, the two fought each other until Stardust opened a portal to a dimension filled with the most evil beings of the [[universe]] hoping to trap Bill there. Bill managed to escape, but a being named Asteroth escaped and began destroying entire worlds. Stardust and Bill joined forces, with Stardust using his powers to open a [[black hole]] behind Asteroth hoping to lock Asteroth in it. However, Asteroth resisted and the hole instead sucked both Stardust and Bill to a near death.{{issue|date=December 2012}}\n\nGalactus had empowered Ray to help Stardust take down her opponent. With the black hole still open, Ray managed to do this, but in return was together with Asteroth sucked into the hole. Stardust has returned off-panel through unknown means, evident by her presence in Annihilation.{{issue|date=December 2012}}\n\n===Annihilation===\nStardust is sent by Galactus to ask the Silver Surfer to meet with Galactus.<ref>''[[Annihilation (comics)#Annihilation: Silver Surfer|Annihilation: Silver Surfer]]'' miniseries</ref> Stardust meanwhile is under orders to help the other remaining former heralds Red Shift and Firelord as they combat the Annihilation wave fleet. Later the three heralds join with Nova's United Front and defeat and capture one of [[Annihilus]]' queens. With the Silver Surfer and Galactus now captured and Firelord half-dead, Stardust and Red Shift are the only two active heralds.{{issue|date=December 2012}}\n\nStardust and [[Red Shift (comics)|Red Shift]] were presumed dead after holding back a massive energy blast from Galactus' absorbing device. Stardust has since returned.<ref name=\"Annihilation1\"/><ref>''Fantastic Four'' #547 (May 2007)</ref>\n\nIt is later revealed that Stardust is an Ethereal, a race of beings of pure energy, and that being imbued with the Power Cosmic, in effect, made Stardust indestructible, allowing her to reconstitute herself if \"destroyed\". She was then confronted by the last fifty-three members of their race, who were nearly made extinct by the Annihilation Wave. Accusing Stardust of treason for leaving them, they attacked Stardust, and in the ensuing battle Stardust \"kills\" the remaining members of their race in self-defense, and then absorbs the remainder of their living energies. However, she then finds Galactus and, distraught that she has been replaced as a Herald by the Silver Surfer, gives up the remains of her race to feed Galactus, against their protests; an act that surprises Galactus, as no herald has ever willingly given up its race to him. Stardust is then named Galactus's second herald, as Galactus's now increased hunger requires more worlds to devour. It is also then revealed that Galactus is the only creature that Stardust will ever love.<ref name=\"Annihilation1\"/>\n\n===Gender clarification===\nWhen she first revealed her existence, Stardust claimed that she existed as pure cosmic energy, making it hard to say whether Stardust is a male or female.  Stardust was also referred to as \"he\" in ''Stormbreaker'', the character's first appearance,{{issue|date=December 2012}}  but a particular reference to Stardust in ''Fantastic Four'' makes the character appear to be female,{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}. Later writers would make Stardust female, reflected by her appearance in The Super Hero Squad Show voiced by Cheryl Hines.\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nStardust is a [[Herald of Galactus]] imbued with the [[Power Cosmic]] and as such possesses high levels of superhuman strength, durability,<ref name=\"Stormbreaker\">''Stormbreaker: The Saga of Beta Ray Bill'' #1\u20136 (2005)</ref><ref>''Annihilation: Silver Surfer'' #2</ref> reflexes, and stamina to confront and match powerhouses such as Beta Ray Bill<ref name=\"Stormbreaker\" /> as well as the other standard abilities of a Herald, such as creating a [[black hole]]<ref>''Stormbreaker: The Saga of Beta Ray Bill'' #5</ref> or opening inter-dimensional portals.<ref name=\"The Saga of Beta Ray Bill # 3\"/> Stardust is an Ethereal, a race of beings of pure energy. Being imbued with the Power Cosmic makes Stardust immortal, allowing her to reconstitute herself if \"destroyed\", such as during the Annihilation Wave<ref name=\"Annihilation1\"/> or having its physical structure dispersed.<ref name=\"The Saga of Beta Ray Bill # 3\">''Stormbreaker: The Saga of Beta Ray Bill'' #3</ref>\n\n==In other media==\n\n===Television===\n* Stardust appears in ''[[The Super Hero Squad Show]]'' episode \"Last Exit Before Doomsday\" voiced by [[Cheryl Hines]].<ref>[http://www.comicscontinuum.com/stories/0907/28/voices.htm Comics Continuum]</ref> She arrives on Earth while looking for Silver Surfer. Stardust ends up captured by Doctor Doom's minions as Doctor Doom forces them to take him to Galactus.\n* Stardust appears in ''[[The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes]]'' episode \"Avengers Assemble.\" She appears as one of Galactus's four heralds and is depicted as a creature composed of Sentient Water, rendering her a representative of the element of water. Stardust oversaw the construction of a device in the ocean that would help Galactus consume the Earth. She ended up fighting a team of superheroes consisting of [[Human Torch]], [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]], [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], [[Thing (comics)|Thing]], and [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Hawkeye]]. She was destroyed by the combined attacks of Human Torch and Wasp.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* ''Stormbreaker: The Saga of Beta Ray Bill'' #1 (March 2005)\n* ''Annihilation: Silver Surfer'' #2\u20133 (July\u2013August 2006)\n* ''Annihilation'' #1\u20133 (October\u2013December 2006)\n* ''Annihilation: Heralds of Galactus'' #1 (April 2007)\n\n==External links==\n* {{Marvelwiki|Stardust|Stardust}}\n* [http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix3/stardustgalactus.htm Stardust's profile] on ''The Appendix to the Marvel Handbook''\n* [http://en.marveldatabase.com/Stardust Stardust] at the Marvel Database\n* [http://www.flickscribe.com/2007/04/12/fantastic-four-movie-what-is-a-herald-of-galactus/ \"What is a herald of Galactus?\"] on Flickscribe.com\n* http://marvel.wikia.com/wiki/Lambda-Zero_(Earth-616)\n\n{{Silver Surfer}}\n{{Fantastic Four}}\n{{Marvel Cosmic}}\n[[Category:Villains in animated television series]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics aliens]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters with superhuman strength]]\n[[Category:Fictional androgynes]]"}]}}}}
