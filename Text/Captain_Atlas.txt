He could not breathe in Earth's atmosphere without a special apparatus or breathing serum.\n\nAtt-Lass was one of the Kree Empire's most decorated soldiers, and highly accomplished in all forms of armed and unarmed combat utilized in the Kree Empire. He was an excellent hand-to-hand combatant. He also had the ability to pilot various Kree starships.\n\nThe craftsmen and technicians of the Kree Empire constructed a number of accessories for his use as an officer of the Kree military. His helmet contains a supply of air with the same nitrogen-oxygen balance as Kree-Lar's atmosphere. Alternatively, he can employ a special serum to allow him to breathe Earth'd atmosphere without his helmet; the serum also temporarily alters his skin color to a Caucasian tone. The Kree uni-beam he wears on his wrist projects concussive energy beams and laser like-light beams generating intense heat.  He was the captain of the ''Ramatam,'' and had access to the advanced technology and armament aboard the starship.\n\nHe briefly wore [[Captain Marvel (Mar-Vell)|Captain Marvel]]'s nega-bands, which enabled him to convert psionic energy for a variety of uses, including enhancing his already superhuman strength and durability.\n\n==Other versions==\n===Marvel Zombies===\nIn ''[[Marvel Zombies]]'', a zombie version of Captain Atlas is seen along with other zombified heroes trying to capture [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]] and his group of survivors.<ref>''Ultimate Fantastic Four'' #23.
