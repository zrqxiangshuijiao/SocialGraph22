The character is an [[Atlantis (Marvel Comics)|Atlantean]] of Marvel's [[shared universe]], known as the [[Marvel Universe]]. She is the illegitimate daughter of [[Attuma]].\n\n== Publication history ==\n{{expand-section|date=July 2019}}\nAndromeda was introduced in ''[[Defenders (comics)|The Defenders]]'' #143 (March 1985) and added to the titular supergroup's lineup a few issues later. Writer [[Peter B. Gillis]] later revealed, \"My long-term plan was to populate [[Defenders (comics)|The Defenders]] with my own crew of characters, characters who nonetheless had ties to interesting parts of the Marvel Universe. Andromeda, while not [[Namor|the Sub-Mariner]], gave me a connection to Atlantis.\" However, Andromeda would be the last character Gillis added to the Defenders, since shortly after her debut he was told that the series was being cancelled.<ref>{{cite journal |last=DeAngelo|first=Daniel|date=July 2013|title=The Not-Ready-For-Super-Team Players: A History of the Defenders |journal=[[Back Issue!]]|issue=#65|page=15 |publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}</ref>\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nA member of the [[Homo mermanus]] race, Andromeda is the illegitimate daughter of [[Attuma]] of Atlantis by a woman named Lady Gelva.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Dunkin |first=Jamie |date=2022-08-04 |title=10 superheroes Leslie Grace could play after 'Batgirl' cancelation |url=https://wegotthiscovered.com/movies/10-superheroes-leslie-grace-could-play-after-batgirl-cancelation/ |access-date=2022-10-12 |website=We Got This Covered |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Harn |first=Darby |date=2022-07-24 |title=10 Things Only Marvel Comics Fans Know About Attuma |url=https://screenrant.com/attuma-marvel-comics-unknown-facts-black-panther/ |access-date=2022-10-12 |website=ScreenRant |language=en-US}}</ref><ref name=\"CBR\">{{Cite web |last=Webber |first=Tim |date=2018-10-12 |title=The Defenders Of The Deep: Who Are Marvel's New Underwater Avengers? |url=https://www.cbr.com/avengers-namor-undeerwater-defenders-team-explanation/ |access-date=2022-10-12 |website=CBR |language=en-US}}</ref> He did not know of her existence until she confronted him and told him he was her father.<ref>''Iron Man'' Annual #10.

Despite her skills, she was considered unworthy of promotion in the Atlantean military because she is a woman even though she was highly decorated.<ref>''The Defenders'' #149.

She took the name Andrea McPhee and posed as a surface woman.<ref>''The Defenders'' #143.

To stop the Dragon of the Moon, [[Doctor Strange]] cast a spell which returned the souls of the Defenders fallen in the battle against the Dragon to the bodies of several recently deceased humans, changing them into duplicates of the Defenders. Andromeda's soul entered the body of '''Genevieve Cross''' and these Defenders now called themselves the '''Dragon Circle'''. Together the Dragon Circle banished the Dragon from Earth and Andromeda returned to the oceans.<ref>''Doctor Strange'' vol. 3 #3-4.

Andromeda led a rebellion to stop her father Attuma from invading the surface world, but was bested by Attuma in personal combat.

She is also able to move freely underwater. However, without special aid she will die in the open air. To counteract this, Andromeda uses a serum that allows her people to survive up to 12 hours out of the water, and in addition, provides her with the skin color of a surface-dweller. Without her serum, Andromeda loses her vitality the longer she spends out of the water, and would eventually die if she was out of water for long enough. Andromeda is proficient in many weapons but prefers the Atlantean trident. She is also skilled in hand-to-hand combat, and as a military leader. She is superhumanly strong and can lift around 4 tons in the air, and at least 14 tons underwater.\n\n==Notes==\n* Genevieve Cross is called Genevieve Cass in the Dragon Circle entry in the ''Handbook of the Marvel Universe '89'' edition.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix3/andromedadef.htm|Andromeda}}\n* {{Marveldatabase|Andromeda}}\n\n{{Namor}}\n{{Defenders}}\n\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1985]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics Atlanteans (Homo mermanus)]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters who can move at superhuman speeds]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters with superhuman strength]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics female superheroes]]"}]}}}}
