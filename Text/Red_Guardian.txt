The Red Guardian is an identity that was created as the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] equivalent of [[Captain America]], although its use has continued after the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]].\n\nThe Aleksei Shostakov incarnation of Red Guardian has made scattered appearances in animated media and video games, with [[David Harbour]] portraying him in the 2021 [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] film ''[[Black Widow (2021 film)|Black Widow]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nerdist.com/article/everything-we-know-about-black-widow/|title=Everything We Know About BLACK WIDOW|website=Nerdist|access-date=2019-07-21}}</ref> Harbour will reprise the role in the upcoming film ''[[Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase 5#Thunderbolts (2024)|Thunderbolts]]'' (2024).\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n===Aleksey Lebedev===\n'''Aleksey Lebedev''' (Russian: \u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0435\u0439 \u041b\u0435\u0431\u0435\u0434\u0435\u0432), the Golden Age version of Red Guardian, first appeared in ''Namor, The Sub-Mariner Annual'' #1 (June 1991), created by writers Dana Moreshead and Mike Thomas, and artist [[Phil Hester (comics)|Phil Hester]]. Very little is known of him, but he fought alongside [[Spirit of '76 (Marvel Comics)|Captain America]] (William Naslund) and the [[Namor|Sub-Mariner]] at the [[Potsdam Conference]], in July 1945.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/redgrd.htm |title=Red Guardian (Russian, World War II, Captain America ally) |publisher=Marvunapp.com |access-date=2011-01-12}}</ref> He began his career during World War II, and met the [[All-Winners Squad]] (formerly the [[Invaders (comics)|Invaders]]) on only one recorded occasion, clashing with them shortly after the war's end where he taunted Captain America (secretly the [[Jeffrey Mace|Patriot]]) that he was 'slowing down' after he was able to catch Captain America's shield.<ref>''Captain America: Patriot'' #2</ref> Like the other crusaders of the same name, he was created as a Soviet counterpart to Captain America.{{issue|date=March 2013}} He was later apparently killed during the purges of the 1950s, opposing the brutal experiments that would later create his successor.<ref>''The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z Update 2010'' #4</ref>\n\n===Alexei Shostakov===\n'''Alexei Andreevich Shostakov''' was the first version of Red Guardian, and was created by [[Roy Thomas]] and [[John Buscema]], first appearing in ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]'' #43 (January 1967).\n\nAlexei Shostakov was born in Moscow, and was the husband<!--PLEASE DO NOT CHANGE; THIS IS ABOUT THE COMICS, NOT THE MCU--> of Natasha Romanova. Both he and his wife were agents of the Soviets: the latter as the [[Black Widow (Natasha Romanova)|Black Widow]] while the former became a test pilot and KGB agent and then trained as a Soviet counterpart to Captain America known as the \"Red Guardian\".{{issue|date=July 2021}}\n\nAlexei Shostakov was one of the Soviet Union's most acclaimed pilots. During World War II on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]], he shot down a large number of [[Luftwaffe]] fighter planes in aerial battles and was credited for helping the [[Soviet Air Forces]] win air supremacy over the skies of [[Volgograd|Stalingrad]] and [[Kursk]]. Because of his extraordinary skill, Shostakov was chosen for the most secret and dangerous tests and new aircraft for the Soviet Union. This included being the first pilot to test fly the [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15|MiG-15]]. The Soviet state controlled news media greatly publicized this and certain other missions of his such as his aerial battles against the [[U.S. Air Force]] over [[MiG Alley]] during the [[Korean War]]. As a result, Shostakov was decorated as a hero of the Soviet Union. Shostakov was also successful in his private life, having married the equally famous ballerina Natalia (familiarly known as Natasha) Romanova.\n\nAs the Cold War flared up in the 1950s, Soviet Premier [[Nikita Khrushchev]] realized that the Soviet Union needed its own equivalent to Captain America. Khrushchev chose Alexei Shostakov over [[Yuri Gagarin]] who would later become the first man in space. The KGB faked his death and trained him in secret, keeping his survival a secret from Natasha. He became a master of hand-to-hand combat and a highly skilled athlete. In addition, he carried a throwing disc on his belt which could be used against an opponent. Magnetic force returned the disc after throwing. The disc had the yellow hammer and sickle symbol on it and his costume was red with a star on his chest to symbolise the Soviet flag. While the Black Widow became disillusioned with KGB masters and defected to the United States, the Red Guardian remained loyal and became more ruthless and vindictive. The Red Guardian battled the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] with his Chinese ally Colonel Ling, to protect a Communist Chinese secret weapon located at a secret military base at an unrevealed location in the People's Republic of China, encountering the Black Widow and [[Captain America]] (Steve Rogers). When the Black Widow noticed \"something familiar\" about him, Red Guardian revealed his identity. He was shot and mortally wounded minutes later by Colonel Ling while saving the lives of the Black Widow and Captain America. He was buried under molten lava when a laser blast caused the eruption of a long-dormant volcano.<ref>''The Avengers'' #43-44</ref>\n\nSome time later, a [[Life Model Decoy]] patterned after the character was introduced in the \"[[Widowmaker (Marvel Comics)|Widow Maker]]\" crossover between the ''[[Hawkeye & Mockingbird]]'' and ''Black Widow'' titles as '''[[Ronin (Marvel Comics)|Ronin]]'''.<ref>''Widowmaker'' #1 (February 2011)</ref> The LMD initially started assassinating spies and eventually targeted [[Mockingbird (Marvel Comics)|Mockingbird]] and the Black Widow. After he was seemingly destroyed in his first battle with the Black Widow,<ref>''Marvel Graphic Novel'' #61</ref> the LMD was later revealed to be alive and had risen very high up in power within [[Bulgaria]] as Ronin. The LMD was responsible for a plot to capture and try his \"former wife\" for crimes as a Soviet super soldier, but his plan was foiled with the help of [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]] and the Avengers.<ref>''Daredevil'' (vol. 2) #64</ref>\n\n===Dr. Tania Belinsky===\n{{Main|Starlight (Marvel Comics)}}\nDr. Tania Belinsky, a neurosurgeon from the USSR, later adopted the Red Guardian identity and joined the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]]. Created by [[Steve Gerber]] and [[Sal Buscema]], she first appeared in ''[[Defenders (comics)|The Defenders]]'' #35 (May 1976).\n\n===Josef Petkus===\n'''Josef Petkus''' is the fourth version of Red Guardian, first appearing in ''[[Captain America (comic book)|Captain America]]'' #352 (April 1989), and was created by writer [[Mark Gruenwald]] and artist [[Kieron Dwyer]]. The character subsequently appears in ''The Avengers'' #319-324 (July\u2013October 1990), ''The Incredible Hulk'' (vol. 2) #393 (May 1992), and ''Soviet Super-Soldiers'' #1 (November 1992). The character subsequently appears as the '''Steel Guardian''' in ''Iron Man'' (vol. 2) #9 (October 1998). Petkus appeared as part of the \"Supreme Soviets\" entry in the ''[[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Update '89]]'' #7.\n\nJosef Petkus was a special operative for the intelligence agencies of the Soviet Union, and appeared as a member of the militant [[Soviet Super-Soldiers|Supreme Soviets]]. Alongside the Supreme Soviets, he attacked the [[Soviet Super-Soldiers]] for defecting from the Soviet Union. Alongside Captain America, he later battled a bear-like creature composed of the [[Darkforce]].<ref>''Captain America'' #352-353</ref> The Supreme Soviets were later renamed the post-Soviet [[Russia]]n super-team called the [[Winter Guard]]. Alongside this confederacy, he teamed with the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and [[Alpha Flight]] to battle the Peace Corpse, the [[Homo mermanus|Atlantean]] Army, and the Combine.<ref>''The Avengers'' #319-324</ref> Petkus later joined a Winter Guard splinter group called the [[Soviet Super-Soldiers|People's Protectorate]], now calling himself the \"Steel Guardian\".<ref>''Iron Man'' (vol. 3) #9</ref> He and his team went off in search of the timelord [[Immortus]], hoping to find a way to resurrect Vanguard's sister Lanyia. They agreed to fight off Dire Wraiths invading Immortus' realm in exchange for this favor; Josef being killed while in the line of duty.<ref>''Darkstar and the Winter Guard'' #2</ref>\n\n===Krassno Granitsky===\n'''Krassno Granitsky''', a fifth version of Red Guardian, appeared in ''[[David North (comics)|Maverick]]'' #10 (June 1998), and was created by writer Jorge Gonzales and artist Leo Fernandez. The name \"Krassno Granitsky\" comes from the [[James Bond]] novel ''[[From Russia, with Love (novel)|From Russia With Love]]''; it is the Russianized name of the assassin Donovan \"Red\" Grant.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} He teamed up with the mercenary superhero Maverick to battle a crime lord.

All are highly skilled athletes. Shostakov was an expert pilot, a master hand-to-hand combatant, and was trained in espionage techniques by the [[KGB]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Marvel Encyclopedia: Updated and Expanded}}</ref> All of the Guardians but Alexei and Tania have used a steel shield similar to that used by Captain America. Alexei and Tania used a \"belt-buckle\" disc, a hurling weapon which magnetically returned to the wearer's hand when thrown, and was a part of their costume's [[Buckle|belt buckle]]. The fourth Red Guardian, Josef Petkus, often employed an energized sword as a secondary weapon alongside his shield.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' (vol. 2) #393 (May 1, 1992)</ref> The sixth Red Guardian was an LMD named Anton, whose powers are cybernetic based. His falsified backstory was that he was an expert engineer and former Crimson Dynamo pilot; his real strength lies in his moderate degree of enhanced cybernetic physicality. The latest Red Guardian is Nikolai Krylenko/Vanguard, brother to Laynia Petrovna, whose powers are derived from his mutation.<ref>''Soviet Super Soldiers'' #1 (November 1992)</ref> which stems to a fullbody force field that repels electromagnetic and kinetic energy, forces he can best guide and direct through a medium like the technically advanced vibranium shield supplied to him by the Executive Security Committee.<ref>''Darkstar and the Winter Guard'' #2\u20133 2010</ref> or through a crux like the former symbol of his home country, a hammer and sickle.<ref>''Iron Man'' #109-112 (1978)</ref> He also directs this force against the earth itself to obtain flight. Nikolai wears a more advanced suit than previous Red Guardians, which is lined with circuitry that works in conjunction with the compact computer on his shield, not only enabling the guided flight and return through their digital connection, but the amplification of the effects of his own energy field.<ref>''Age of Heroes'' #3 (July 21 2010)</ref>\n\n==Other versions==\n\n===Exiles===\nIn one of the ''[[Exiles]]'' realities, a Red Guardian in full body armor on Earth-3470 appears.<ref>''Exiles'' #84</ref>\n\n===Civil War: House of M===\nRed Guardian was seen as a member of the Soviet Super Soldiers.<ref>''Civil War: House of M'' #2</ref>\n\n===Ultimate Marvel===\nThe [[Ultimate Marvel]] version of Alexei Shostakov is a Russian super soldier codenamed \"Captain Russia\". Meant to be the Russian counterpart of [[Captain America (Ultimate Marvel character)|Captain America]], this version is certifiably insane and uses a makeshift shield created partially from human remains, and possesses superhuman strength and durability. A fight between the two results in Captain America defeating him, by stabbing him with splintered wood that acts as a stake through the chest, declaring \"Fighting is about winning.\"<ref>''Ultimate Nightmere'' #1-4</ref> Shostakov was once married to [[Black Widow (Natasha Romanova)|Black Widow]] and is now deceased.<ref>''The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe'' #1-2</ref> \n{{Comics character list header\n|name       = Colonel\n|Marvelwiki = \n|CBDBid     = 4345\n|GCDid      = Colonel\n}}\n'''Colonel Abdul al-Rahman''' from [[Azerbaijan]] (leader of the [[Masters of Evil|Liberators]]) was based on the Red Guardian. As the character was a parallel to Captain America, he wears a predominantly red costume and was transformed into a super-soldier by [[Russian people|Russian]] scientists as well as uses a weapon which resembles a double bladed [[lightsaber]]. He faces off against Steve Rogers in front of the White House, one on one but is defeated when the [[Hulk]] throws the [[Captain America's shield|shield]] to sever his hands and Rogers kills him with his own weapon.
