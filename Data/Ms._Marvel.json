The character was originally conceived as a female counterpart to [[Captain Marvel (Marvel Comics)|Captain Marvel]]. Like Captain Marvel, most of the bearers of the Ms. Marvel title gain their powers through [[Kree]] technology or genetics. Marvel has published four ongoing comic series titled ''Ms. Marvel'', with the first two starring '''[[Carol Danvers]]''' and the third and fourth starring '''[[Kamala Khan]]'''. The Carol Danvers version was the highest-ranked female character on ''[[IGN]]''{{'}}s ''Top Avengers'' list, coming in at #11.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Top 50 Avengers - IGN |url=https://www.ign.com/lists/avengers |access-date=2022-03-16 |website=www.ign.com}}</ref>\n\n== Carol Danvers ==\n{{main|Carol Danvers}}\nCarol Danvers, the first character to use the moniker Ms. Marvel, first appeared in ''Marvel Super-Heroes'' #13 (March 1968) by writer [[Roy Thomas]] and artist [[Gene Colan]] as a non-superpowered officer in the [[United States Air Force]]. After being caught in an explosion with the [[Kree]] superhero [[Captain Marvel (Mar-Vell)|Captain Marvel]] in ''Captain Marvel'' #18 (November 1969), Danvers resurfaces in ''Ms. Marvel'' #1 (January 1977) with super powers resulting from the explosion, which caused her DNA to merge with Captain Marvel's. As Ms. Marvel, Danvers becomes a mainstay of the superhero team [[The Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]], beginning in ''[[The Avengers (comic)|The Avengers]]'' #171 (May 1978). Danvers goes on to use the codenames '''Binary'''<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #164 (December 1982)</ref> and '''Warbird'''.<ref>''The Avengers'' vol. 3 #4 (May 1998)</ref> In July 2012, Danvers assumes the mantle '''Captain Marvel''' in honor of its deceased, original bearer, Mar-Vell, after [[Captain America]] tells her that Mar-Vell would want her to have it.<ref name=Beard120317>{{cite web |last=Beard |first=Jim |date=17 March 2012 |title=WonderCon 2012: Captain Marvel |url=http://marvel.com/news/story/18290/wondercon_2012_captain_marvel |website=marvel.com |publisher=Marvel |access-date=19 March 2012}}</ref>\n\n== Sharon Ventura ==\n{{main|Sharon Ventura}}\nSharon Ventura, the second character to use the pseudonym Ms. Marvel, first appeared in ''[[Thing (comics)|The Thing]]'' #27 (September 1985), by [[Mike Carlin]] and [[Ron Wilson (comics)|Ron Wilson]], as a [[stunt performer]] with the [[Thunderiders]], where she met The Thing. In ''The Thing'' #35 (May 1986), Ventura volunteered for [[Power Broker (character)|Power Broker]]'s experiment to receive superpowers in order to join the Unlimited Class Wrestling Federation with The Thing, taking the name Ms. Marvel. Ventura later joins the [[Fantastic Four]] herself in ''Fantastic Four'' #307 (October 1987) and, after being hit by cosmic rays in ''Fantastic Four'' #310 (January 1988), Ventura's body mutates into a similar appearance to that of The Thing and receives the nickname '''She-Thing'''.\n\n== Karla Sofen ==\n{{main|Karla Sofen}}\nDr. Karla Sofen, the supervillain known as '''Moonstone''', first appeared as the [[gun moll]] of [[Doctor Faustus (comics)|Doctor Faustus]], in ''[[Captain America (comic book)|Captain America]]'' #192 (December 1975) by [[Marv Wolfman]] and [[Frank Robbins]]. In ''[[Hulk|The Incredible Hulk]]'' vol. 2 #228 (October 1978), Sofen becomes the psychiatrist of the villain Moonstone, also known as [[Nefarius|Lloyd Bloch]]. Sofen tricks Bloch into giving her the meteorite that empowers him, and she adopts both the name and abilities of Moonstone. During the \"[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]\" storyline, Sofen joins [[Norman Osborn]]'s group of Avengers, known as the [[Dark Avengers]], as the doppelganger of the previous Ms. Marvel, Carol Danvers, receiving a costume similar to Danvers' original (Danvers wore the Warbird costume at the time).<ref>''[[Dark Avengers]]'' #1 (January 2009)</ref> Sofen becomes the title character of the ''Ms. Marvel'' series beginning in issue #38 (June 2009) until Danvers takes the title back in issue #47 (January 2010).\n\n== Kamala Khan ==\n{{main|Kamala Khan}}\nKamala Khan, created by [[Sana Amanat]], [[G. Willow Wilson]], and [[Adrian Alphona]], is the fourth character to take the name Ms. Marvel. Khan first appeared in ''Captain Marvel'' #14 (August 2013) and is a 16-year-old [[Pakistani-American]] from [[Jersey City, New Jersey]], who idolizes Carol Danvers. Khan was given her own ''Ms. Marvel'' series, which premiered in February 2014, becoming Marvel Comics' first [[Muslim]] character to headline her own comic book.<ref>{{cite web |last=Wheeler |first=Andrew |date=6 November 2013 |title=All-New Marvel NOW!
