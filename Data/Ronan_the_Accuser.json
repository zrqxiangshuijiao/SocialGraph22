Ronan later joined the Accuser Corps, who are the Kree equivalent of military governors and jurists, and his rise through their ranks was extraordinary; he eventually became the third-most powerful being in the Kree Empire. The [[Supreme Intelligence]] ultimately appointed him \"Supreme Accuser of the Kree Empire\". He is known simply as \"Ronan ''the'' Accuser\".\n\nOn his first mission, Ronan is sent to Earth to investigate the destruction of a robotic [[Sentry (Kree)|Kree Sentry]] at the hands of the [[Fantastic Four]].

Marvel Comics.</ref> However, Black Bolt eventually found out that the Kree commander had lied to Karnak about Ronan's fate.

Now merely a cyborg, Ronan begged Black Bolt to end his misery as he apologized for all the pain he caused to the Inhumans to which he complies by whispering \"You are forgiven.\"<ref>''Death of the Inhumans'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nAs a Kree warrior in peak physical condition, Ronan possesses his species' unique [[physiology]] and is thus resistant to poisons, toxins, and diseases. He has superhuman physical attributes which are all further enhanced by his exoskeleton body-armor. Ronan's armor, which contains multiple scanners, can also create fields of invisibility, and his gauntlets can discharge cosmic energy bolts or generate sufficient coldness to place certain lifeforms into a state of suspended animation. In addition, Ronan possesses a brilliant strategic mind; his high intellect allowed him to rise to one of the highest positions in the Kree Empire. He also has extensive knowledge in all matters pertaining to Kree law and is well-versed in the use of his species' highly advanced technology.\n\nRonan's primary weapon is a warhammer-like Accuser Cosmi-Rod called the \"Universal Weapon\". At its wielder's will, the device can absorb and fire cosmic energy, manipulate matter, generate force-fields, control gravity, and create \"time-motion displacement fields\". It also allows for interstellar teleportation, hyperspatial passages and flight. As a highly trained Kree soldier, Ronan is extremely proficient in the use of this weapon in both close- and long-ranged confrontations. Even without his war hammer, Ronan has proven a formidable hand-to-hand combatant.\n\n==Other versions==\n===Ultimate Marvel===\nThe [[Ultimate Marvel|Ultimate]] version of Ronan the Accuser is the son of [[Thanos]], and is a part of his empire.
