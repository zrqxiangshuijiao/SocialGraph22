Shortly after their decision to marry, Hector was possessed by an enemy of his father, [[Hawkman]], and killed. Fury was pregnant with Hector's child, and it was instrumental in the Silver Scarab's defeat. In ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'', a new Earth-2 with a similar history is created, and Lyta Trevor serves as a member of the Justice Society Infinity.\n\nLyta, like all her Infinity Inc. counterparts, briefly made an appearance during the DC ''[[Convergence (comics)|Convergence]]'' crossover. Powerless and trapped on Telos, Lyta Trevor became a police officer before regaining her powers and taking on a Post-Crisis version of Jonah Hex. Eventually, Lyta and all of Infinity Inc. take over for the Justice Society on a returned Earth-2.\n\n===Post-''Crisis''===\n====Hippolyta \"Lyta\" Trevor-Hall====<!-- This section is linked from [[List of DC Comics characters: F]] -->\nFollowing the 1985 miniseries ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', the Golden Age Wonder Woman retroactively no longer existed, and Lyta was now the daughter of the newly created character Helena Kosmatos, the Golden Age Fury (a Greek superheroine and a member of the [[All-Star Squadron]], and an [[avatar]] of the [[Erinyes|Fury]] [[Tisiphone]]) and had been raised by Joan Trevor (n\u00e9e Dale), the [[Quality Comics]] superheroine [[Miss America (DC Comics)|Miss America]], and her husband, Derek.<ref name=\"dc-ency\"/> Lyta was told of her mother's history by [[Alecto]],<ref>''Infinity Inc.'' #34 and ''Secret Origins'' (vol. 3) #12</ref> and visited yearly by the time-travelling [[Hippolyta (DC Comics)|Hippolyta]], who trained Lyta as a heroine.\n\nFor a while, Lyta served with [[Infinity, Inc.]], but eventually left the team to bear a child.<ref name=\"dc-ency\"/> At home, Lyta was visited by a resurrected Hector Hall. After his death, Hall mistakenly believed he had been chosen as the Guardian of Dreams, the [[Sandman (DC Comics)|Sandman]], and joined the real Sandman in the Dream Dimension, where they had adventures masterminded by the two schemers Brute and Glob.<ref>''Infinity, Inc.'' #49-51</ref>\n\n[[Image:Lyta-Hall-Fury.png|thumb|left|225px|After suffering a nervous breakdown, Lyta Hall searches for her baby [[Daniel (comics)|Daniel]] in ''[[Sandman (Vertigo)|The Sandman]]'' #60; pencils by [[Marc Hempel]], inks by [[D'Israeli (cartoonist)|D'Israeli]].]]\nIn [[Neil Gaiman]]'s ''[[The Sandman (comic book series)|The Sandman]]'', it was revealed that the Dream Dimension was a portion of the [[Dreaming (comics)|Dreaming]] enclosed by Brute and Glob during [[Dream (DC Comics)|Morpheus]]' imprisonment, as a domain of their own. Upon Morpheus' return, Hector's soul was released and Lyta was sent back to Earth, where she gave birth to their son. Afterwards, Lyta blamed Morpheus for Hector's death;<ref>''The Sandman'' (vol. 2) #11-12</ref> but Morpheus visited the child, named him [[Daniel Hall (comics)|Daniel]], and claimed him as an heir.<ref>''The Sandman'' (vol. 2) #21</ref> When Daniel was later captured by [[Loki]] and [[Robin Goodfellow]], Lyta invoked the Furies to destroy Morpheus, whereupon Daniel became the new Lord of the Dreaming.<ref name=\"dc-ency\"/>\n\nAt [[The Sandman: The Wake|the wake]] held for Morpheus, Lyta met her son in his new role.

She appeared in ''[[Justice Society of America|JSA]]'' where she was reunited with Hector, now reincarnated as [[Doctor Fate]]. At some point between the graphic novel and her return in ''JSA'', the evil wizard [[Mordru]] had captured Lyta and imprisoned her in Dr. Fate's amulet. Once freed, she rejoined her husband and later regained her true memories of Daniel.\n\nDuring the [[Spectre (DC Comics character)|Spectre]]'s quest to destroy magic throughout the DC Universe, he banished Doctor Fate and Lyta to a freezing mountain, later identified as part of [[Hell (DC Comics)|Hell]].

She was a Greek national who had learned her brother was co-operating with Italian Fascists who previously killed her father. When she confronted her brother with this revelation in front of their mother, it was too much for the widow to take and she died of an instant heart attack. Wishing revenge upon her brother, she was approached by [[Tisiphone]], one of the [[Erinyes|Eumenides]] or Furies, who gave her a suit of magic [[armor]], which increased her strength, speed and stamina. When angered, she became an [[avatar]] of Tisiphone, and it was in this state that she killed her brother.<ref name=\"dc-fur1\"/>\n\nShe was later briefly released from this possession, and retained the other powers, but is once again acting as Tisiphone's avatar.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #168-169</ref>\n\nAt one point, the [[Amazons (DC Comics)|Amazon]] [[Hippolyta (DC Comics)|Queen Hippolyta]] took over the role of [[Wonder Woman]] and traveled back in time to aid the [[Justice Society of America|JSA]] against the Nazis. During this time, Helena began to look to Hippolyta as a mother figure and believed that she was indeed the daughter of the Amazon queen, despite the knowledge that her true parents were killed during the war. When Queen Hippolyta returned to her own time, Helena sought a magical means to gain eternal youth; this was accomplished via a magical document that, if destroyed, would revert Helena to her true age and possible death. After this was done, Helena met Hippolyta's true daughter Diana and took an immediate dislike to her. By this point, Helena's mental state was near collapse, as she began to behave irrationally.<ref name=\"dc-ency\"/> Diana took her to [[Themyscira (DC Comics)|Themyscira]], where Hippolyta addressed Helena as a daughter to support her fragile psyche.<ref>''Legends of the DC Universe'' #30-32</ref> After Hippolyta's death during the ''[[Our Worlds At War]]'' saga, Helena went into mourning and much of her mental imbalance was resolved.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #173</ref> Thereafter she served [[Artemis of Bana-Mighdall|Artemis]] and [[Philippus (fictional character)|Philippus]] as a trusted aide. Her powers were briefly stolen from her by [[Cheetah (comics)#Barbara Ann Minerva|Barbara Ann Minerva]] whose role as the Cheetah had been usurped by [[Sebastian Ballesteros|Sebastian Ballestros]]. Minerva used the power of Tisiphone to kill Ballestros, regaining her Cheetah form, and restored Helena's powers.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #180-187</ref>\n\nDuring the events of ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', [[OMACs]] engaged the Amazons of Themyscira in battle, and the Amazons relocated their island home to another plane of existence. Helena Kosmatos is shown leaving with the other Amazons.<ref>''Infinite Crisis'' #3</ref> A year after their departure, the Amazons return to wage war on the U.S., which takes place in the ''[[Amazons Attack]]'' storyline. Helena is never shown as part of this return.\n\n====Erik Storn====\nIn ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'' Week 21, a new [[Infinity Inc.]] created by [[Lex Luthor]] was introduced, with a male hero going by the name of Fury. The newest Fury had been given blackened skin and razor-sharp claws from submitting to Luthor's Everyman Project. ''Infinity Inc.'' #1 (Sept. 2007) reveals that, after Luthor's arrest and after the project was shut down, Erik has become depressed when his powers were shut down and has developed a stuttering problem. He is also suffering from hot flashes and mistakenly took his mother's clothes from the laundry one day. In ''Infinity Inc.'' #3, Erik reveals that the stutter is a [[defense mechanism]] to hide his desire for self-[[castration]]. He also transforms into a fighting woman named \"Erika\". In #8, Erik/Erika is given a costume and the superhero name \"Amazing Woman\".\n\nErik is later found and tortured by [[Codename: Assassin]], having discovered, and shared with [[Jimmy Olsen]], precious information about ''Project 7734'', the secret agenda of General [[Sam Lane (comics)|Sam Lane]] for Kryptonians. Shifting one last time to the all-powerful Erika body, Erik is able to put Jimmy in contact with Natasha Irons before dying.<ref>''Superman's Pal: Jimmy Olsen Special'' #2 (2009)</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nFury has superhuman strength, speed and endurance, enhanced senses and durability, animal empathy, and regenerative healing factor. She is also invulnerable to magic.\n\n==Other versions==\n===Earth 2===\nIn September 2011, ''[[The New 52]]'' rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, Fury made her debut in ''Earth 2'' #8 (2013). She is the daughter of the late Wonder Woman of Earth 2 and [[Steppenwolf (comics)|Steppenwolf]] of Apokolips.<ref name=Guide>{{cite book |last1=Cowsill |first1=Alan |last2=Irvine |first2=Alex |last3=Korte |first3=Steve |last4=Manning |first4=Matt |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |last6=Wilson |first6=Sven |title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia: The Definitive Guide to the Characters of the DC Universe |date=2016 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-5357-0 |page=115}}</ref> In issue #14 of ''Earth 2: Society'' (Sept 2016), she reveals Fury is her war name, while Donna is her true name, thus making this Fury a doppelganger of [[Donna Troy]]. The first Fury, Lyta Trevor, was more of an analogue to Donna Troy.\n[[File:Fury Earth 2.JPG|thumb|Donna as Fury in ''Earth 2: Society'' #2.]]\nThis version of Fury is the last Amazon, as the other Amazons had perished five years earlier during the [[Apokolips|Apokoliptian]] invasion of Earth 2. She is shown to be working with Steppenwolf. This Fury wears a red and silver costume resembling that of [[Orion (comics)|Orion]]. This new version of the character appears to be more powerful than the previous versions. As mentioned in the ''New 52'' ''Earth 2'' comic book, Fury and Big Barda are evenly matched in strength, as well as skill. In ''[[Worlds' Finest|World's Finest Huntress/Power Girl]] Annual'' #1, a 'First Contact Prelude' issue, Donna is seen trading blows and going toe to toe with Power Girl, who at the time was still calling herself \"Supergirl\", displaying further proof of how strong and powerful she truly is. It is also mentioned that she has received training from Big Barda, as well as her father Steppenwolf.<ref>''Earth 2'' #8 (2013)</ref>\n\nAs Darkseid's forces converge closer to Earth 2 and assimilate the planet as fuel for Apokolips, Mister Miracle manages to change Fury's mind and she joins the opposition against Darkseid. Following the destruction of Earth 2 and the events of ''Convergence'', Fury takes on the role of Wonder Woman of Earth Two. She is more warlike than her mother, and willing to use deadly force if necessary. At the end of the series ''Earth 2: Society'', Fury uses Pandora's Box from the Ultra-Humanite to reshape Earth 2 into like the classic Golden Age era and World War II setting, but mixed with contemporary technology and absence of any international crisis, super-villains or the Wonders.\n\n==In other media==\n[[Image:Aresia.jpg|thumb|Aresia from the ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' series]]\n* A character inspired by the Lyta Trevor and Helena Kosmatos incarnations of Fury called '''Aresia''' appears in the ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' episode \"Fury\", voiced by [[Julie Bowen]].<ref>{{cite web |first=Jason |last=Brice |url=http://www.silverbulletcomicbooks.com/bobro/105878867911875.htm |title=The Furies |publisher=Silverbulletcomicbooks.com |access-date=2011-01-30 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121233211/http://www.silverbulletcomicbooks.com/bobro/105878867911875.htm |archive-date=2008-11-21}}</ref> As a child, she and her mother were forced to flee their unspecified homeland on a refugee ship, but it was attacked and sunk by pirates. After being separated from her mother and left aimlessly drifting for days, Aresia eventually washed ashore on [[Themyscira (DC Comics)|Themyscira]], where she was taken in by Queen [[Hippolyta (DC Comics)|Hippolyta]] and raised as an [[Amazons (DC Comics)|Amazon]]. During the last stage of her Amazon rebirth, Aresia secretly left the island to exact revenge on the world's men, believing this will make her a hero in the other Amazons' eyes. With help from [[Lex Luthor]]'s [[Injustice Gang]], she makes a special magic-based virus that will only affect men and tests it on [[Gotham City]], plunging it into chaos. The [[Justice League]] intervene, but the male members succumb to the virus, leaving [[Wonder Woman]] and [[Shayera Hol|Hawkgirl]]. Aresia joins forces with [[Carol Ferris|Star Sapphire]] and [[Katana (comics)|Tsukuri]] to spread her virus globally via a hijacked stealth bomber and modified missiles before telling Hippolyta of what she has done. Disgusted that Aresia broke Amazon law, Hippolyta reveals the ship's male captain rescued Aresia and accompanied her to Themyscira before dying of heart failure. Despite this, Aresia intends to continue her plot until Wonder Woman and Hawkgirl drive off her allies and jam the bomber's missile bay doors. The Leaguers and Hippolyta escape, but Aresia dies in the subsequent plane crash. The heroines later discover Aresia's notes and use them to create an antidote for her virus.\n* An African-American version of Fury inspired by the Erik Storn incarnation named '''Rosa''' appears in ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]'', voiced by Quei Tann. Similarly to Storn, Rosa is a member of Lex Luthor's [[Infinity Inc.]], which is later reworked into the Infinitors.
