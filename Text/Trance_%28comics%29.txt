A [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]], Hope attended the [[X-Mansion|Xavier Institute]] before its closing. She retained her powers after [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]] and is a member of the X-Men's training squad.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nHope was raised in [[Bloomfield Hills]], [[Michigan]]. When Hope's powers manifested, it appeared as if a ghost had come out of her body, giving her father a [[heart attack]]. She was then sent to the [[X-Mansion|Xavier Institute]] by her parents believing that she would be \"cured.\"<ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=preview&id=774&disp=table Comic Book Resources Wolverine: Killing Made Simple Preview<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nWhile at the institute, Hope was put in the [[Paragons (comics)|Paragons Squad]] under the watch of [[Wolfsbane (comics)|Wolfsbane]]. Hope then took on the codename Trance. When it was outed that Wolfsbane and a student ([[Elixir (comics)|Elixir]]) had been in a relationship, Wolfsbane decided to leave. [[Magma (comics)|Magma]] then took over as the squad's advisor.{{issue|date=November 2011}}\n\nWhen the events of [[Decimation (comics)|Decimation]] transpired, she was one of only 27 students to keep her powers. Greatly weakened by the losses, [[Emma Frost]] placed all of the remaining students into an all-out brawl to determine who would become the team of [[New X-Men (2004 series)|X-Men]] in-training.  Hope did not make the team yet, like all of the other students who retained their powers, still resides at the institute.{{issue|date=November 2011}}\n\nIn response to M-Day, the government began gathering all information they had on the remaining mutants. Additionally, the [[Sentinel (comics)#Sentinel Squad O*N*E|Sentinel Squad O*N*E]], a team of human-piloted Sentinels, was sent to \"watch over\" the X-Men and the handful of [[refugee]]s symbolically known as [[X-Men: The 198|The 198]].  According to said files, Hope was willing to work with other mutants in training sessions but had not yet received any [[combat]] experience.{{issue|date=November 2011}}\n\nHope's interests include old [[film]]s, House Music, classical music and Psytrance and it appears she is rather culturally sophisticated. Her classmates voted her 'best-dressed' in the yearbook.{{issue|date=November 2011}}\n\n===Quest for Magik===\nTrance is among the students who were captured by [[Belasco (comics)|Belasco]] and transported to [[Otherplace|Limbo]]. As per [[X-23]]'s request, Trance uses her astral projection to warn the students who weren't captured of Belasco's return. Thanks to Trance, the students were successfully saved and brought back by the X-Men.{{issue|date=November 2011}}\n\n===Messiah Complex===\nTrance was present at the Institute when [[Predator X (Marvel Comics)|Predator X]] attacked the school. Trance barely got out of the way in time. Unfortunately the school was shut down and all the students were sent home.{{issue|date=November 2011}}\n\n===Killing Made Simple===\nBlindfold had a vision and informed the X-Men that Trance was going to be in trouble. While having dinner with her family, Trance's home was attacked by [[Orphan-Maker]] on Nanny's orders, but Trance wasn't his target, her parents were. Luckily [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] had been sent by the X-Men to watch over her. Springing to action, Wolverine tries to fight off Orphan Maker but is overpowered. With a change of plans, Trance and Wolverine are kidnapped. Trance is later seen tied to a chair with Wolverine chained to the ground. Trance, believing that Wolverine will save them, refuses to use her powers. After realizing that Wolverine cannot help her, she astral projects outside her body and begins blasting Nanny and Orphan-Maker. The two villains eventually eject in an escape pod, leaving the ship to crash. Using her energy blasts, Trance disables the self-destruct timer. The ship crashes in a lake, but Trance and Wolverine are safe.{{issue|date=November 2011}}\n\n===Utopia===\nTrance later relocates to San Francisco along with all the other X-Men.<ref>''X-Men: Manifest Destiny'' #2</ref>\n\nTrance is seen with [[Dragoness (comics)|Dragoness]] and [[Toad (Marvel Comics)|Toad]], who are being pursued by H.A.M.M.E.R. agents. After Dragoness is taken out, Trance goes into her astral form only to have her power disrupted when her body is shot with tasers. [[Gambit (Marvel Comics)|Gambit]] shows up and knocks out the H.A.M.M.E.R. agents. Trance, in her astral form, lies on the ground asking for help when [[Ariel (comics)|Ariel]] and [[Onyxx (comics)|Onyxx]] appear and take her body away to safety. Later, [[Mindee Cuckoo]] informs [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] that Trance never made it back to base and that she is detecting Trance's thoughts somewhere downtown, prompting Rogue and her team to search for her.<ref>''X-Men: Legacy'' #226</ref> Trance's power disrupted Ariel's attempt to teleport her to safety.  Rogue finds Trance and her powers are flaring out of control creating powerful uncontrollable bio-electric blasts. Rogue tries to help calm Trance and help her gain control when [[Moonstone (comics)|Ms Marvel]] appears. After taking out Gambit and [[Danger (comics)#Sentience revealed|Danger]], Rogue and Ms Marvel fight, unfortunately Rogue is losing until Trance regains control and jumps in to help Rogue. Trance learns that her astral form is able to punch [[Moonstone (comics)|Ms Marvel]] when they are both intangible.  After  Gambit stuns Ms Marvel, they teleport back to base where Trance receives medical attention.<ref>''X-Men: Legacy'' #227</ref>\n\n===Necrosha===\nTrance is seen with [[Husk (comics)|Husk]] and the New X-Men battling the resurrected [[Synch (comics)|Synch]] and [[Skin (Marvel Comics)|Skin]].<ref>''X-Force'', vol. 3 #22</ref>\n\nTrance is part of a team of X-Men that investigates [[Blindfold (comics)|Blindfold's]] vision about [[Muir Island]].<ref>''X-Men: Legacy'' #231</ref> Trance, along with most other members of this team, is briefly possessed by [[Proteus (Marvel Comics)|Proteus]] when he attacks. This possession is interrupted by [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue's]] use of [[Betsy Braddock|Psylocke's]] psychic knife.<ref>''X-Men: Legacy'' #232</ref>  The team eventually defeats Proteus before returning to Utopia.{{issue|date=November 2011}}\n\n===Second Coming===\nDuring the events of Second Coming, [[Cannonball (comics)|Cannonball]] recruits Trance along with [[Northstar (Marvel Comics)|Northstar]], [[Dazzler (Marvel Comics)|Dazzler]], [[Anole (comics)|Anole]], [[Gambit (Marvel Comics)|Gambit]], and [[Pixie (X-Men)|Pixie]] on a mission to recover [[Magik (comics)|Magik]] from Limbo.  Hope is initially reluctant to accept this mission, but agrees to go as long as she can leave her body on Earth.<ref>''X-Men: Second Coming Revelations\u2014Hellbound'' #1</ref>  Upon arriving in Limbo, the team becomes separated when they are overwhelmed by Limbo's demonic inhabitants.  Trance fights alongside Pixie and tries to protect Pixie from the influence of Magik's demon, N'Astirh.  The effort, however, causes Trance to disappear from Limbo and reawaken in her body in Utopia.<ref>''X-Men: Second Coming Revelations\u2014Hellbound'' #2</ref>\n\n===Wolverine and the X-Men===\nTrance is currently a student at the Jean Grey School for Higher Learning.<ref>X-Men Regenesis</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\n[[File:XMEN-TrancePowers.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Trance using her powers]]\nTrance has the power of [[astral projection]] and as her [[code name]] suggests, she goes into some kind of [[altered state of consciousness]] or somehow otherwise nullifies her body in order to release her astral self. This observation was further affirmed when she asked Emma Frost if she could leave her body outside the danger room during an exercise. Her astral form is capable of flight and can pass through magic barriers.  Her astral form was able to physically punch [[Moonstone (comics)|Moonstone]]'s intangible form.  Trance's astral form is additionally able to project destructive energy. When hit with tasers by H.A.M.M.E.R. agents during ''X-Men: Legacy'' #226 in the middle of entering her trance state, her powers flare out of control, disrupting [[Ariel (comics)|Ariel]]'s attempt to teleport her to safety.  She also creates arcing energy surges that stun soldiers and even bend nearby metal and concrete.  According to Danger and Rogue, this appears to be a new part of her power which she has not learned to control.<ref>''X-Men: Legacy'' #226\u2013227</ref>\n\nShe can also perceive auras and energy patterns that are invisible to the naked human eye such as the emotional state of others from their auras, heat signatures and energy patterns in the air. [[Doctor Nemesis]] further speculates that Trance's powers seem to react to spatial warps and energy fields; however, he doesn't know if this is a permanent or a temporary development.<ref>''X-Men: Legacy'' #228</ref>\n\n==Other media==\n===Television===\n* She appears in the episode \"Greetings from Genosha\" from  ''[[Wolverine and the X-Men (TV series)|Wolverine and the X-Men]]'' series.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n{{X-Men characters}}\n\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 2005]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics mutants]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from Michigan]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics female superheroes]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Nunzio DeFilippis]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Christina Weir]]\n\n[[pt:Astral]]"}]}}}}
