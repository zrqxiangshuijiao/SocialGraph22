Mark Conroy served in the Vietnam war. Lt. Conroy's unit, calling themselves the ''Half-Fulls'', discovered an ancient temple deep in the jungles of [[Cambodia]], and met a mystic named [[Tai (comics)|Tai]] who convinced most of them to marry the six daughters of the ''Dragon's Breadth'' cult. The soldiers returned home with their new brides, and Mark and his wife had Eric soon after.<ref>''The New Warriors'' #24 (1992)</ref>\n\nEric was once the enforcer for a mobster in [[Chicago]], until the [[Left Hand (comics)|Left Hand]] killed his boss and recruited him to join the [[Folding Circle]].<ref>''The New Warriors'' #17 (1991)</ref> The Left Hand is Diego Casseas, one of the members of Conroy's unit, who had stolen the mystical power inherent in his own child. Eric Conroy is now recruiting the Dragon's Breadth children in order to take control of the ''Well of All Things''. This is an ancient fountain of power that exists deep inside the Cambodian temple. In one of his first missions, Eric Conroy kills a security guard. This action transforms Eric Conroy's body; unbreakable pink material wraps around his arms, legs, and waist.<ref>''The New Warriors'' #22</ref>\n\nThe Folding Circle arrives at the temple, along with the [[New Warriors]], and discovers that Tai wants to sacrifice everyone but herself so she can gain the Well's powers. The teams work together to save their own lives, and Tai is seemingly slain by [[Night Thrasher]]. The Folding Circle escapes, stealing the New Warriors' [[List of vehicles in Marvel Comics#Quinjet|quinjet]]. The Folding Circle crashes in [[Madripoor]] and tries to become players in the Madripoor underworld, taking over a drug organization.<ref>''Night Thrasher'' vol. 2 #2</ref> Later, Night Thrasher and [[Silhouette (comics)|Silhouette]] defeat the entire Circle.<ref>''Night Thrasher'' vol. 2 #4</ref>\n\n===Powers and abilities===\nBloodstrike is a mutate whose powers come from the Universal Wellspring.<ref>''[[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]'' #107</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Refbegin}}\n*{{comicbookdb|type=character|id=10173|title=Bloodstrike}}\n{{Refend}}\n\n{{New Warriors}}\n\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1992]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Fabian Nicieza]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from Chicago]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters with superhuman strength]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics male supervillains]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics mutates]]"}]}}}}
