He travels to the 20th century and joins the X-Men, a team he knew only as legends. Bishop experiences difficulty adjusting to the norms of the time period.\n\nBishop made frequent appearances in [[X-Men: The Animated Series|the ''X-Men'' animated series]] of the 1990s. Bishop was portrayed by [[Omar Sy]] in the 2014 film ''[[X-Men: Days of Future Past]]''.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Publication history==\nCreated by [[Whilce Portacio]] and [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]], the character first appeared in ''[[The Uncanny X-Men]]'' #282 (November 1991).<ref>{{cite book |last1=DeFalco |first1=Tom |last2=Sanderson |first2=Peter |last3=Brevoort |first3=Tom |last4=Teitelbaum |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |last6=Darling |first6=Andrew |last7=Forbeck |first7=Matt |last8=Cowsill |first8=Alan |last9=Bray |first9=Adam |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-7890-0 |page=50}}</ref>\n\nBishop had four limited series. The first series is the self-titled ''Bishop'' series, where he tracked and fought [[Mountjoy (comics)|Mountjoy]]. The series ran for four issues, from Dec. 1994 to March 1995.{{cn|date=March 2021}}\n\nThe second series to star Bishop is ''XSE'', which showcased his past (future). The four-issue miniseries ran from Nov. 1996 to Feb. 1997. In the year of 1998, the series received a sequel titled, ''Bishop: Xavier's Security Enforcers''. The sequel is a three-issue miniseries, which ran from Jan. to March of the year 1998.{{cn|date=March 2021}}\n\nHe also teamed up with [[Gambit (Marvel Comics)|Gambit]] to oppose [[Stryfe]] in the eight-issue ''Gambit and Bishop: Sons of the Atom''. The series ran in the year of 2001. He also starred in the series ''Bishop: The Last X-Man'' (1999\u20132001), in which he was trapped in another [[alternate history|alternate timeline]]. The fourteen-issue series ran from Aug. 1999 to Jan. 2001.{{cn|date=March 2021}}\n\nHe appeared regularly in ''[[District X]]'' (2004\u20132005), a [[police procedural]] set in a mutant ghetto in [[New York City]]. He was cast as a police officer in New York City\u2019s \"mutant town\", but the series was canceled after 14 issues. He also starred in the [[House of M]] tie-in, ''Mutopia''.{{cn|date=March 2021}}\n \nWriter Sam Humphries revealed in an interview that Bishop would be back in our timeline and would be one of the first enemies of the new incarnation of [[Uncanny X-Force]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=41085|title=Humphries Enters the Shadowy World of \"Uncanny X-Force\"|date=19 September 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n\n===Early life===\nBorn about 80 years in the future of the Marvel Universe, Bishop was the son of [[Australian Aboriginal|Aboriginal]] mutant refugees who fled to America from Australia one day before Australia was devastated by a nuclear attack.<ref>''X-Men: The Times and Life of Lucas Bishop'' #1</ref> He was raised in a mutant [[internment|concentration camp]] in the aftermath of the Summers Rebellion, an uprising in which mutants and humans joined forces to destroy the [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinels]]. Bishop has a distinctive M [[human branding|brand]] over his right eye, used to identify [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutants]] in his era. After his parents were killed, Bishop was taken in by a man named LeBeau, also called [[Alternative versions of Gambit#Bishop's future|Witness]], who was reportedly the last man to see the legendary X-Men alive. According to LeBeau, Bishop's adoptive grandmother took Bishop away from him. Bishop and his younger sister, [[Shard (comics)|Shard]], were then subsequently raised by his grandmother within the same mutant concentration camp in [[Brooklyn]].<ref>''[[Xavier's Security Enforcers|XSE]]'' #4</ref>\n\nBishop's grandmother taught him many legends of the X-Men, who were old allies of hers. Depowered by unknown means, she had entered the camps in secret to raise her grandchildren. Upon her deathbed, she made Bishop swear to protect Shard. After the Rebellion, the mutants were \"emancipated\" and sent out of the camps to fend for themselves. Bishop and Shard, who were only children, were left alone. They lived on the streets, stealing in order to survive until coming under the care of a family friend, a war veteran named Hancock. Slightly blind, Hancock nevertheless took on the task of raising the two.\n\nOne day, Bishop encountered an anti-human group of mutants called the Exhumes, who took Shard hostage just before the XSE arrived. Until that time, Bishop had admired the Exhumes, attributing to them his proud, idealized notion of the legendary X-Men. It wasn't until the XSE defeated the Exhume and saved his sister that Bishop knew he wanted to join the XSE. When Bishop was 15, Hancock was murdered by criminals who were promptly arrested by the XSE, and he and Shard enlisted in their ranks. Shard soon surpassed Bishop to become the youngest XSE officer.\n\nDuring a training class, Bishop's instructors and some of his fellow students were attacked and killed. Bishop rallied the survivors and led the struggle against the assailants until reinforcements arrived. Bishop gradually climbs the ranks of the XSE until finally becoming their commander.\n\nWhile on a mission to wipe out a nest of [[Emplate]]s, mutant [[vampire]]s that feed on [[bone marrow]], Shard was critically injured. Bishop went to Witness for help. Witness, then imprisoned at the New York Stark Fujikawa building, agreed to transfer Shard's essence into a holographic matrix if Bishop would work for him for one year. Bishop agreed, leaving the XSE for a time. The details of Bishop's work during this period are unknown; Bishop appears reticent on the subject, later refusing to tell Shard of his actions.\n\nImmediately upon his re-installment as a commander in the XSE, Bishop and his XSE group the \"Omega Squad\" captured [[Trevor Fitzroy]], a murderous ex-XSE trainee in the ruins of the [[X-Mansion|Xavier Institute]] War Room. While there, Bishop discovered a damaged recording of [[Jean Grey]], in which she spoke of a traitor destroying the X-Men from inside. Haunted by his discovery, Bishop confronts Witness for details, but receives only a vague, ambiguous response, leaving Bishop to suspect his former master of being more than simply a witness to the downfall of the X-Men.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Brevoort |first1=Tom |last2=DeFalco |first2=Tom |last3=Manning |first3=Matthew K. |last4=Sanderson |first4=Peter |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |title=Marvel Year By Year: A Visual History |date=2017 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1465455505 |page=255}}</ref>\n\n===Joining the X-Men===\nFitzroy escaped from prison and used a large amount of mutant life-force to open a time portal and break out 93 mutant criminal \"Lifers\" in the process. Bishop found himself in the past in the time of his heroes, the X-Men. Bishop and the Omega Squad eventually \"sanctioned\" the Lifers, but did not get Fitzroy. Bishop encountered the X-Men for the first time but did not believe that they were really the X-Men. He then battled them but later allied with the X-Men in trying to stop Fitzroy. Malcolm and Randall, the two members of his Omega Squad, died in the process.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #282</ref> [[Professor X|Professor Charles Xavier]] offered him a place in the X-Men, and he was placed under [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]]'s tutelage. He fought and defeated Styglut.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #287-288</ref> When he met Gambit, Bishop recognized him as possibly a younger version of the Witness and fought him.<ref>''X-Men'' #8</ref>\n\nHe soon met [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]] for the first time,<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #289-290</ref> and alongside the X-Men he battled the [[Morlocks (comics)|Morlocks]]<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #291-293</ref> and the Death Sponsors.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' Annual #16</ref> Bishop assigned himself the role of Xavier's personal bodyguard, which he failed at when Stryfe, the evil double of [[Cable (comics)|Cable]], critically wounded Xavier. Initially, the X-Men believed that Cable was the would-be assassin, so [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] and Bishop tracked down Cable, but then travelled to Cable's \"Graymalkin\" space station and joined with him in finding Stryfe.<ref>''X-Factor'' #84-86; ''X-Force'' #16-18; ''X-Men'' #14-16; ''The Uncanny X-Men'' #294-296</ref> Citing his failure to protect Professor X, Bishop offered to resign from the X-Men. His resignation was rejected by Xavier, and then alongside the X-Men he battled the [[Acolytes (comics)|Acolytes]].<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #298</ref>\n\n===Age of Apocalypse===\nWhen Professor Xavier's insane son, the mutant [[Legion (Marvel Comics)|Legion]], went back in time to assassinate [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]], Bishop was one of the X-Men sent to stop him.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #320</ref> When they failed and Legion accidentally killed Professor Xavier, Bishop was the only time-traveler to remain when history was altered and became the [[Age of Apocalypse]].<ref>''X-Men: Alpha'' one-shot</ref> He eventually convinced the Magneto of that era that the existence of this reality was wrong, and with a great amount of sacrifice, managed to correct the error and stop Legion.<ref>''X-Men: Omega'' one-shot</ref> After the timeline reset itself, Bishop received some of his counterpart's unsettling memories of the Age of Apocalypse.<ref>''X-Men: Prime'' one-shot</ref>\n\nThe traitor in the X-Men was eventually revealed to be Professor X in the form of [[Onslaught (Marvel Comics)|Onslaught]]. Bishop's knowledge of the future was the only thing that stopped Onslaught from killing the X-Men. As Onslaught fired a massive blast of psionic energy at the distracted X-Men, Bishop threw himself in front of them and absorbed the blast that would have killed them. Onslaught, winded from such a massive attack, said that his blast was enough to kill a thousand mutants and \"Another time, another place, I would have been proud\". Bishop lost consciousness after absorbing the blast but soon recovered, although it was not enough to prevent Onslaught from nearly destroying all of humanity. He made peace with Gambit, who was not the traitor after all.<ref>''Onslaught: X-Men'' one-shot</ref>\n\nFollowing this, Bishop was captured by Trevor Fitzroy's henchmen and taken to a distant possible future, detailed in the ''Bishop: The Last X-Man'' series. He again faced Fitzroy, with Bishop eventually killing him. He was temporarily returned to the present by [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] who needed him as one of [[The Twelve (X-Men)|The Twelve]], before finally returning permanently during the [[Maximum Security (comics)|Maximum Security]] crossover.<ref>''Bishop:The Last X-Man'' #15 (Jan. 2000)</ref>\n\n===X-Treme X-Men===\nBishop was a founding member of Storm's splinter team of X-Men, whose mission was to search for the Books of Truth, the diaries of the precognitive mutant [[Destiny (Irene Adler)|Destiny]].<ref>''[[X-Treme X-Men]]'' #1</ref> They left against the will and knowledge of the main team, as the splinter group did not trust in Xavier or the others to use the diaries for the benefit of humanity.<ref>''[[X-Treme X-Men]]'' #3</ref>\n\n===District X===\nBishop joined the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]]. District X, or 'Mutant Town', had a high-population density. It was also a poverty-stricken area with high crime rates. Bishop was assigned to the area in order to resolve mutant-related crimes.<ref>''District X'' #1 (2004)</ref>\n\n===Civil War===\nIn the ''[[Civil War: X-Men]]'' miniseries, Bishop sides with the [[Office of National Emergency|O*N*E*]] to bring in the X-Men and [[X-Men: The 198|the 198]]. He argues with [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] over allowing their escape and states his fear of what the future might hold. [[Valerie Cooper|Val Cooper]] and [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]] let Bishop lead [[Micromax]] and [[Sabra (comics)|Sabra]] into action against [[Domino (comics)|Domino]], [[Shatterstar]], and the rest of the 198. Bishop led them to the base where the 198 was hiding and told the X-Men to stand down upon their arrival. General [[Demetrius Lazer]] betrayed him by ensuring that Cyclops attacked Bishop. Though at first he simply absorbed it, the power was too much for him to control and he was overwhelmed. Bishop was forced to direct the energy he had absorbed upwards in a powerful blast that destroyed an O*N*E* Sentinel. He later teamed up with the X-Men to save the 198 from a bomb explosion and then went his own way, leaving the X-Men. Bishop was among Iron Man's pro-registration forces that guarded the [[Negative Zone]] prison. When [[Captain America]]'s team breaks in, a fight ensues, putting Bishop at odds with his former teammates Storm and Cable.<ref>''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'' #6</ref>\n\n===Messiah Complex===\n{{Main|X-Men: Messiah Complex|l1=Messiah Complex}}\nIn ''Messiah Complex'', an event revitalized Bishop's timeline as a viable future: the birth of the first mutant child since [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]]. As the [[Marauders (comics)|Marauders]], on [[Mister Sinister]]'s orders, try to gather anyone and anything with knowledge of the future, Bishop is the only target they were unable to locate and terminate. It is revealed that he had betrayed the X-Men and he attempted to kill the baby. Before he could succeed, he was thwarted by the Marauders, who escaped with the baby.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #494</ref> As X-Men arrive on the scene, Bishop pretends to have attempted to retrieve the baby. As [[Jamie Madrox|Multiple Man]]'s duplicate and [[Layla Miller]] find out in their mission to one of the planet's possible futures (80 years in the future) that the birth of the child created, the child apparently kills a million people in an event dubbed the Six-Minute War, and the U.S. government incarcerates all the mutants into concentration camps, where Bishop is born, grows up, and sees his parents killed. As Multiple Man's dupe and Layla find out, Bishop wishes at a young age to have had the opportunity to kill the baby, so that while he would not be born, he would also not have to see his parents die, and to endure the horrors of life in the concentration camps. Layla kills the dupe so that the information conveyed to them by young Bishop can return to the present, to the Multiple Man prime, who conveys Bishop's treachery to the X-Men.<ref>''X-Factor'' #27</ref> The X-Men then attempted to alert [[X-Force]] of Bishop's betrayal, but he managed to block all of their communication channels. After arriving on [[Muir Island]] and fighting past the Marauders, Bishop found Cable attempting to escape with the baby and the two fight. Both mutants are then attacked by [[Predator X (Marvel Comics)|Predator X]], who viciously rips off Bishop's right arm. Bishop cauterizes his torn shoulder on an unconscious Sunfire and in an attempt to shoot down a teleporting Cable, he misses and hits Professor X instead.<ref>''X-Men'' #207</ref>\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:CABLE004 cov.jpg|Cover art for ''Cable'' (vol. 2) #4. Art by [[Ariel Olivetti]].|thumb]] -->\n\n====Chasing the Mutant Messiah====\nBishop managed to escape the X-Men after he seemingly killed their mentor, and stole a nuclear powered bionic arm from Forge equipped with a timeslide device, which he uses to track down Cable and the newborn mutant.<ref>''Cable'' vol. 2 #2</ref> Upon finding them, he shoots Cable twice before being hindered by a local gang. With Cable severely weakened by blood loss, he makes a risky attack before the gang can find heavier weapons.<ref>''Cable'' vol. 2 Annual #1</ref> He later manages to track down Cable, slaying several mutated beasts in the process, and shoot the Mutant Messiah. He also finds that in the future generated by his choice, Cable will be always revered as a messianic figure who tried his best to protect the child and saved humanity from the very beasts that Bishop unwillingly saved Cable from. It has been revealed that the Messiah child is still alive and Bishop has been captured by the X-Men. In his efforts to kill the child, Bishop has left several traps for Cable throughout the timestream, killing millions in the process, though he doesn't see them as people who actually exist but as people who wouldn't exist or come back to life if he kills [[Hope Summers (comics)|Hope]].<ref>''Cable'' #9</ref>\n\n====Messiah War====\nAfter multiple failings at killing Hope, Bishop locates and enlists the aid of Stryfe, promising him that he would aid him in killing Apocalypse and Cable. Stryfe and Bishop travel to a point in the future where Apocalypse is at his weakest and manage to defeat him.<ref>''Cable'' vol. 2 #14</ref> Stryfe builds an empire using Celestial technology and Bishop becomes his right-hand man, waiting for Cable and Hope to re-emerge. When they do appear along with X-Force, Hope is kidnapped. Bishop betrays Stryfe and his plot to kill Hope is foiled by Stryfe, who wants to make her his heir. Both attempts are foiled by Apocalypse, X-Force, and Cable. Cable manages to rescue Hope and escape yet again.<ref>''X-Force'' vol. 3 # 16</ref> Bishop escapes into the \"near future\" of the 21st century, reconstructing his arm, vowing to find Hope once again.<ref>''X-Force'' vol. 3 #14-17</ref><ref>''Cable vol. 2 #12-15</ref>\n\n====Homecoming====\nAfter several years of running from Bishop, Hope finally decides that it is time to return to the present. During a battle, Bishop manages to knock out Cable. In a fit of rage, Hope's powers awaken and render Bishop unconscious. Hope then attempts to kill Bishop, but is stopped by Cable. They take Bishop's time machine and leave him stranded. Bishop is somehow transported with them and begins chasing them through time, in an attempt to kill Hope before they reach the present.<ref>''Cable'' vol. 2 #21</ref> In ''Cable'' vol. 2 #24, Hope and Cable return to the present time but Bishop follows them. He attacks them, running Cable through with a sword. As Cable is incapacitated, Hope rushes to his aid but is ultimately overpowered by Bishop. Cable takes out Bishop's time-traveling device from his techno-organic arm, performs some alterations on it, and places it in Bishop's robotic arm. Cable recovers enough to toss Bishop into the subway. As Bishop attempts to kill Hope one last time, he is transported to a barren and dead Earth (as a result of his efforts to limit Cable and Hope's attempts to find allies and shelter through different time periods) with a red sun in the sky (cause unknown). Bishop, being overconfident, attempts to travel back to the present time to continue his quest to kill Cable and Hope Summers, but due to Cable sabotaging Bishop's time-traveling device, this attempt causes his robotic arm to explode. This leaves him stranded in the year 6700 A.D. Bishop is last shown thinking to himself concerning Cable and Hope, \"I was as much a father to that girl as you were. Whatever she becomes, it's because of me. I was doing the right thing. Wasn't I?\"<ref>''Cable'' vol. 2 #24</ref>\n\n===Return to the Present===\nIn ''[[Uncanny X-Force]]'' vol. 2 #1, Bishop makes his first appearance since being stranded in the future. He is shown arriving in 2013 Los Angeles and announcing \"I'm baaack!\"<ref>''Uncanny X-Force'' vol. 2 #1</ref> He battles the members of the new [[X-Force]] before it is revealed that his mind is apparently being possessed by the [[Demon Bear]] that once terrorized [[Danielle Moonstar]].<ref>''Uncanny X-Force'' vol. 2 #4</ref> After a lengthy conflict, [[Betsy Braddock|Psylocke]] manages to pull the Bear out of Bishop's mind. Storm also uses the opportunity to disrupt the part of Bishop's mind holding his memories of his hunt for Hope, in the hopes that she will thus restore her old friend.<ref name=un5>''Uncanny X-Force'' vol. 2 #5</ref> Bishop is later shown comatose as a result of his ordeal.<ref>''Uncanny X-Force'' vol. 2 #6</ref>\n\nHe eventually regains his memories of Hope.<ref name=un5/> The self-control he has learned during his time in the future helps him move past his former vendetta,{{issue|date=May 2014}} even helping to save Hope's life when Stryfe attempted to manipulate them into attacking each other in revenge for their actions against him during their time-traveling search.<ref>''Uncanny X-Force'' vol. 2 #17</ref>\n\nBishop is shown carrying out research in a library in London, preparing himself for the next 'scheduled' threat he recalls from his future history, when he becomes caught up in the latest attack by the Shadow King,<ref>''Astonishing X-Men'' vol. 4 #1</ref> which results in Charles Xavier being reborn in Fantomex's body.<ref>''Astonishing X-Men'' vol. 4 #6</ref> After the reborn Proteus and Shadow King are defeated, Xavier\u2014now calling himself 'X'\u2014erases the memories of his resurrection from most of the X-Men who worked with him, but he grants each of them a gift, stating that his gift to Bishop is the ability to put his quest to protect the future to the side at times and allow himself to enjoy his life in the present.<ref>''Astonishing X-Men'' vol. 4 #12</ref>\n\nBishop later receives a warning (apparently by Kid Cable) about an unspecified, imminent event that would have catastrophic consequences on the X-Men's timeline. This leads him to Sugar Man's lab where the X-Man has a quick confrontation with the frightened villain before getting knocked unconscious. By the time Bishop wakes up, Sugar Man is dead with his body split in two.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' vol. 5 #1</ref> The event was soon afterward revealed to be the return of Nate Grey, who had found and used the Life Seed on himself. This not only made him recover his powers, but also increased them to the point of overriding the black X-shaped tattoo which was protecting him, and in the process twisted his mind. Nate then uses all his powers, though Jean tries to reason with him, to reshape the world in his image, a world where the X-Men no longer exist.<ref>''The Uncanny X-men'' vol. 5 #10</ref>\n\nUnder the illusionary world, every type of human intimate interaction is forbidden, although this does not stop Bishop and Jean Grey from starting a relationship.<ref>''The Marvelous X-Men'' #1.</ref> This leads to the events of mini-series ''Prisoner X'', where Bishop is take to be \"reconditioned\".<ref>''Prisoner X'' #1-5.</ref>\n\n===Dawn of X and Krakoa===\nIn the new status quo for the X-Men ([[Dawn of X]]), helmed by writer [[Jonathan Hickman]], Bishop is part of the crew of the [[Marauders (comics)|Marauders]], led by [[Kitty Pryde]], and becomes Red Bishop of the [[Hellfire Club (comics)]].<ref>''Marauders'' #1-present</ref> He is also one of the Krakoa's Great Captains\u2014alongside Cyclops, Magik, and Gorgon\u2014before becoming Captain Commander when Cyclops steps aside to lead the X-Men.<ref>''Inferno'' #1</ref> During ''King in Black'', Beast was able to convince Bishop to ignore his orders from Pryde and shoot to kill the symbiote-infected Cyclops and Storm, hinting that he's okay being used by different organizations against one another.<ref>''King in Black: Marauders'' #1</ref> He's also suggested the idea of fusing mutant DNA into new forms\u2014inadvertently arguing for chimeras, which became a major part of Moira MacTaggert's previous failed timelines.{{cn|date=November 2021}}\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nBishop's [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] ability enables him to absorb all forms of radiant or conductive energy that are directed towards him and to release that energy from his body. This power is mostly passive, allowing Bishop to absorb energy at all times.\n\nHe can release this energy in many different forms, usually as concussive blasts of biokinetic energy, even amplified compared to the absorbed amount.<ref>''X-Treme X-Men'' #26</ref> Bishop can also store absorbed energy within his personal reserves, whereupon the energy increases his strength and recuperative abilities as well as affording him a measure of invulnerability.<ref>Bishop's Official Marvel Universe Entry</ref> He is also able to absorb magic energy (as seen when fighting \"[[Growing Man|growing men]]\" in [[Limbo (Marvel Comics)#Immortus' Limbo|Limbo]]) and the psychic energies of psionics as easily as all the other kinds.<ref>''[[X-Men]]'' #140</ref> This does not prevent him from being read or manipulated by a telepath but only sustains him and helps him to slow them down and potentially exhaust them. It has been clearly stated that Bishop is also able to absorb and process kinetic energy similarly to [[Sebastian Shaw (comics)|Sebastian Shaw]], but in a much less effective way.<ref>''Cable'' vol. 2 #3, 2008</ref>\n\nHis powers make it difficult to harm him with energy-based attacks; however, he can become overloaded from absorbing too much energy, though his upper limits are unknown, even to himself; when Rogue was suffering a power overload after absorbing Skrull telepath Z'Cann, Bishop was pushed to his limit simply by grabbing Rogue as he tried to help her drain off her excess power.<ref>''X-Men'' #107</ref> While he can achieve a sort of invulnerability, even against conventional attacks and depending on his energy reserves, some parts of at least the transformation process are also participatory, as for example after falling from a great height he transformed the kinetic energy into pure light and sound, but only could do so because he was conscious. <ref>''Astonishing X-Men'' vol. 4 #4</ref> Bishop is also resistant to most poisons.<ref>''The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z'' #1</ref>\n\nHe can \"let his spirit go\" as seen in ''X-Treme X-Men Annual'' #1. However, it was never clearly explained what this actually means and if this is also part of his powers or if it was taught to him.\n\nHe has also demonstrated the ability to instinctively know where he is and the present hour and date even if asleep, first mentioned in ''[[X-Treme X-Men]]'' #1. Although being the great-grandson of [[Gateway (comics)|Gateway]], a mutant possessing extensive dealings with time travel, this aspect is not one of Bishop's mutant powers. Bishop's explanation is that due to training; he knows where he is at all times.<ref>''X-Treme X-Men X-Pos\u00e9'' #1</ref>\n\nBishop is a highly athletic man, an excellent hand-to-hand combatant with many years of armed and unarmed combat training, and a superb marksman with firearms. When he first came to the modern era, Bishop carried XSE guns from his time that fired laser beams and plasma charges. He also wore his XSE uniform, modeled after X-Men uniforms, which contained [[body armor]].\n\nFor a significant period of time, his right arm was a prosthetic, stolen from [[Forge (comics)|Forge]]. A nuclear-powered battle-ready arm, it incorporates in its design a time-travel device, the ability to channel his energy blasts through, and enhanced strength and resilience.<ref>''Cable'' vol. 2 #2 (2008)</ref> It has since been destroyed after Bishop tried to use it to time travel from 6700 A.D. to 2010 to kill Cable and Hope Summers due to Cable tampering with the time traveling device within it.<ref>''Cable'' vol. 2 #24</ref> His real arm has apparently been re-grown after he was healed in the future by the remnants of humanity.<ref>''Astonishing X-Men'' vol. 4 #1-6</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n* In 2018, ''[[CBR.com]]'' ranked Bishop 26th in their \"Age Of Apocalypse: The 30 Strongest Characters In Marvel's Coolest Alternate World\" list.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Lealos |first=Shawn S. |date=2018-09-16 |title=Age Of Apocalypse: The 30 Strongest Characters In Marvel's Coolest Alternate World |url=https://www.cbr.com/age-of-apocalypse-characters-ranked/ |access-date=2022-10-11 |website=CBR |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n==Other versions==\n\n===Ultimate Marvel===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Ultimatebishop.PNG|Ultimate Bishop.

He is wearing the same uniform as the members of Cable's [[Six Pack (comics)|squad]] and appears to be much older than the mainstream Bishop. He then leads the team into battle with Cable's squad. He fails to stop Cable from kidnapping [[Alternative versions of Professor X#Ultimate Charles Xavier|Charles Xavier]] (everyone believes Xavier is dead) and is trapped in the present day, due to Cable's destruction of the device that allowed him to time travel.<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #76</ref>\n\nIn ''Ultimate X-Men'' #80, Bishop has a conversation with his younger self, who is incarcerated, in which he tells him not to use his powers to escape. By ''Ultimate X-Men'' #84, Bishop has formed a new team of X-Men (consisting of Wolverine, [[Alternative versions of Storm#Ultimate Storm|Storm]], [[Pyro (Marvel Comics)|Pyro]], [[Dazzler (Marvel Comics)|Dazzler]], [[Warren Worthington III|Angel]], [[Betsy Braddock#Ultimate Marvel|Psylocke]], and himself).<ref name=\"uxm\">''Ultimate X-Men'' #84</ref> He is using the new team to stop a new wave of [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinel]] attacks on mutants, caused by an unknown enemy, revealed in that issue to be the [[Fenris (comics)|Fenris]] twins and [[Bolivar Trask]]. Wolverine appears to distrust Bishop, promising to gut him if he tries anything suspicious. Bishop was unconscious during the fight with the Fenris twins and the Sentinels, but when [[Betsy Braddock#Ultimate Marvel|Psylocke]]'s life was at risk, he woke up to defend her and revealed that she was his future wife.<ref name=\"uxm\" />\n\nHe killed both the Fenris twins with his abilities and went on to lead the New X-Men against the Sentinels. At the end of the battle, it was revealed to the reader that he was in fact working with Cable and that the entire \"Cable\" affair had been a ruse to make the X-Men a stronger team. The team remains unaware of the deception and Wolverine stabbed Bishop at the end of issue #90 when Bishop stopped Storm and Dazzler from being able to save Angel from being killed by Sinister before Bishop could reveal this. Bishop believes that it couldn't have happened any other way. Cable later reveals the ruse, but Wolverine shows no regret for killing Bishop.<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #90</ref> After the battle with Apocalypse is undone by the [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix]], there is no evidence that Bishop has been returned to life, even though Angel was.<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #91</ref>\n\nHis powers have been revealed as density control.<ref name=\"uxm75\">''Ultimate X-Men'' #43</ref> For example, he destroyed a Sentinel robot by causing its shell to increase in density and crush its inner parts; Bishop then reduced his own density (or increased that of the air around him) and floated to the ground.<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #82</ref> He also has access to teleportation technology.\n\n[[Robert Kirkman]] later admitted that the Bishop mentioned earlier in the series<ref name=\"uxm75\" /> is the same as the one he introduced; faced with the fact that this Bishop was already introduced into continuity when he would have preferred the character to work with Cable, Kirkman simply introduced him as an older version of the previously-mentioned Bishop.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marvel.com/news/comics.2171.Ultimate_Evolution:_He_Loves_the_90's|title=Kirby 100: Mark Waid|website=News - Marvel.com}}</ref>\n\n===X-Men Noir===\nIn ''[[X-Men Noir]]'', Bishop is depicted as the muscle for [[Alternative versions of Gambit#X-Men Noir|Remy LeBeau]], the owner of a nightclub and casino called The Creole Club.<ref>''X-Men: Noir'' #1</ref>\n\n===X-Men: The End===\nIn ''[[X-Men: The End]]'', the non-canon trilogy of miniseries by [[Chris Claremont]], Bishop learns he has a teenage daughter, [[Aliyah Bishop|Aliyah]], by [[Deathbird]].<ref>''X-Men: The End'' #1</ref> She becomes Majestrix of the [[Shi'ar]] with her father as her Imperial Chancellor.<ref>''X-Men: The End'' #2-3</ref>\n\n==In other media==\n\n===Television===\n* Bishop was featured in several episodes of ''[[X-Men: The Animated Series|X-Men]]'', voiced by [[Philip Akin]].{{cn|date=October 2019}} In his first appearance, he travels back in time to stop the assassination of [[Robert Kelly (comics)|Senator Kelly]] and prevent the ''Days of Future Past'' timeline from occurring. Bishop believes Gambit to be the assassin, but it is later revealed that Mystique attempts the assassination in the guise of Gambit. Upon returning to his own time after saving Kelly, he finds the world infected with a deadly plague. He returns in a later episode to stop the spread of Apocalypse's [[techno-organic virus]], but he also faces resistance from Cable, who knows the virus is necessary as it will create antibodies needed for the stabilization of the mutant genetic code. Later, he appears in a set of episodes where he and his sister travel back in time to stop Trevor Fitzroy from killing the young Charles Xavier in the past, causing constant war between mutants and humans in the X-Men's time. The time travelers eventually manage to save Xavier, but Bishop is trapped in the Axis of Time during Apocalypse's attempt to control all of time in the \"Beyond Good and Evil\" episodes, during which he plays a pivotal role in Apocalypse's defeat. After Bishop leaves the Axis of Time, he reunites with his sister.\n* Bishop appears in ''[[Wolverine and the X-Men (TV series)|Wolverine and the X-Men]]'', voiced by [[Kevin Michael Richardson]].{{cn|date=October 2019}} This version is a member of Professor X's future X-Men team in the Sentinel-dominated future and was trained by Wolverine at a young age.<ref>''Wolverine and the X-Men'' Episode 9 \"Future X\"</ref>\n\n===Film===\nBishop appears in the 2014 film ''[[X-Men: Days of Future Past]]'', played by [[Omar Sy]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Comic-Con: New Character Portraits From X-Men: Days of Future Past | author = Spencer Perry | date = July 18, 2013  | url = http://www.superherohype.com/news/articles/178215-comic-con-new-character-portraits-from-x-men-days-of-future-past | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130721152218/http://www.superherohype.com/news/articles/178215-comic-con-new-character-portraits-from-x-men-days-of-future-past | archive-date = July 21, 2013 }}</ref> In the film, he is among the mutants who meet with Professor X and Magneto at an abandoned Chinese monastery. He is shown regularly working with Kitty to use her new time-projection abilities to save them from Sentinel ambushes, Kitty projecting him back in time a few days so that he can warn the others and they can move on before they are caught. However, Logan is chosen for the plan to undo the creation of the Sentinels as the other mutants either are not old enough to go back that far or could not cope with the psychological strain. In the final stand against the Sentinels, Bishop is killed when the Sentinels overload his energy absorption abilities and he explodes. These events are later erased by the altering of the timeline.\n\n===Video games===\n* Bishop is a [[player character|playable character]] in ''[[X-Men: Next Dimension]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://uk.cheats.ign.com/ob2/068/480/480934.html |title=IGN: X-Men: Next Dimension Cheats, Codes and Cheat Codes |access-date=2009-09-17 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071205002812/http://uk.cheats.ign.com/ob2/068/480/480934.html |archive-date=2007-12-05 }}</ref>\n* Bishop is a [[player character|playable character]] in ''[[X-Men: Gamesmaster's Legacy]]''.{{cn|date=May 2019}}\n* A younger version of Bishop makes a cameo in ''[[X-Men Legends]]'', voiced by [[Grey DeLisle]].{{cn|date=May 2019}} The X-Men encounter him while fighting Sentinels on the streets of New York.\n* [[Khary Payton]] voices Bishop who is a playable character in ''[[X-Men Legends II: Rise of Apocalypse]]''.<ref name=\"btva\">{{cite web|title=Lucas Bishop Voice - X-Men franchise <nowiki>|</nowiki> Behind The Voice Actors|url=https://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/characters/X-Men/Lucas-Bishop/|website=behindthevoiceactors.com|date=December 18, 2019|postscript=.
