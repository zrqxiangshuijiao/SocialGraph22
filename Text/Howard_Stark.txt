The character is usually depicted as a background character in stories featuring [[Iron Man]] and stories featuring [[Captain America]]. He is the founder of [[Stark Industries]]. Throughout the character's publication history, he has been featured in several incarnations of comic book series.\n\nHoward Stark has also appeared in several animated television series and films. Actors [[John Slattery]] and [[Dominic Cooper]] have portrayed the character throughout the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU) franchise.\n\n==Publication history==\nHoward Stark was created by [[Archie Goodwin (comics)|Archie Goodwin]] and designed by artist [[Don Heck]]. He made his first appearance in ''[[Iron Man (comic book)|Iron Man]]'' #28 (August 1, 1970).<ref>{{cite comic|writer=[[Archie Goodwin (comics)|Goodwin, Archie]]|penciller=[[Heck, Don]]|inker=Craig, Johnny|title=Iron Man|issue=#28|story=The Controller Lives!|date=August 1970}}</ref> He was loosely based on [[Howard Hughes]], a film producer and aviator.\n\nDescribed as a sarcastic scientist and ruthless businessman, Howard worked alongside his father on various projects, and later founded [[Stark Industries]]. He was an inventive mechanical engineering prodigy, constantly creating new technology and looking for ways to improve such technology. He designed and built weaponry and devices that have revolutionized the industrial world, such as various technologies used by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] and its allies. Howard later married to [[Maria Stark]], and they had their child, [[Tony stark|Tony Stark]]. Howard's relationship with Tony was a difficult one. Howard's major weakness was his severe case of [[alcoholism]], a problem Tony himself would inherit. In the comics, Howard and his wife died in a car crash, as the result of faulty brakes arranged by either business competitors [[Roxxon Energy Corporation|Republic Oil & Gas]] or by [[V-Battalion]]. Howard's death inspired his son to take both business and engineering seriously as Iron Man.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marvel.com/universe/Stark,_Howard|title=Stark, Howard \u2013 Marvel Universe Archive|access-date=August 17, 2014|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref>\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n===Original depiction===\n[[File:Iron Man 28 The Controller Lives! (1970) - Cover.jpg|300x452px|thumbnail|Howard Stark's first appearance in ''[[Iron Man (comic book)|Iron Man]]'' #28 (August 1970)]]\nBeing the son of Howard Stark, Sr., he was born in Richford, New York. An avid and brilliant inventor from a young age, Howard was a brilliant scientist throughout his life, becoming a power systems engineer. Stark and his father worked on various projects with his skills in engineering, and later founded Stark Industries. Throughout his young adulthood, Stark worked on various government projects dating back to the [[World War I]] and [[World War II]] era, like the Captain America project with John Crowe Ransom which came to completion thanks to [[Steve Rogers]], the [[Manhattan Project]], and the [[Arsenal (Marvel Comics)|Arsenal]] robots hidden in a subbasement in his mansion. During the 1950s, Stark was an agent of the secret science organization known as The Shield (S.H.I.E.L.D), partnered with [[Nathaniel Richards (Marvel Comics)|Nathaniel Richards]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Hickman |first=Jonathan |date=June 1, 2011 |title= Chapter One: Terribilita |location=New York City|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref>\n\nHoward Stark married [[Maria Stark|Maria Collins Carbonell]] and together they had a son, and adopted [[Tony Stark|Anthony \"Tony\" Stark]]. He constantly pushed Tony to be the best, telling his son that someone must have \"iron in their backbone\" to be successful. Behind his heroic facade, however, he was an alcoholic who had a strained relationship with his son. Stark was capable of devotion and respect towards machines, but he appeared to have little to no interest towards his son. Due to his power as a businessman, Stark was offered membership to the exclusive [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]], but Stark seemed uninterested in anything other than the lavish parties the club threw. It is believed Stark was also a member of the V-Battalion. He was targeted by the [[Red Skull]] (Johann Schmidt), and is rumored to have met [[Uatu]] the [[Watcher (comics)|Watcher]]. Stark also prevented [[Iron Monger|Obadiah Stane]] from taking control of Stark Industries at least once.{{issue|date=December 2012}}\n\nOn the [[Ides of March]] (March 15), Howard and Maria were killed in a car accident. It has been hinted that the incident was not random and possibly arranged by the V-Battalion, but this has never been confirmed; earlier indications were that the accident was caused by [[Roxxon]]'s predecessor Republic Oil as part of [[Simon Krieger]]'s corporate sabotage.<ref>''Iron Man: The Iron Age'' #1\u20132 (August\u2013September 1998)</ref> Tony ran his father's company, started a charity in his mother's name, and later went on to be Iron Man.<ref>''Tales of Suspense'' #39.

The spirit wore a demonic version of [[Iron Man's armor]] and taunted Iron Man about emotional weaknesses. Iron Man rejected the spirit's reality when claiming that Iron Man had been a disappointment to his mother as well as his father. However, Iron Man knew that Maria's love was unconditional.<ref>''Iron Man: Legacy of Doom'' #2. Marvel Comics (New York City).</ref>\n\nDuring the 2014 [[Original Sin (comics)|Original Sin]] storyline, a flashback revealed that Stark first met [[Nick Fury]] following the death of Woody McCord during the fight against the Tribellians. Stark decided to show Fury the work McCord had been doing as a defender of Earth, neutralizing any potential threat for the planet, and offered Woody's job. Fury accepted, and over the next years, would secretly fight different superhuman threats from aliens to Subterranean monsters and extra-dimensional beings.<ref>''Original Sin'' #5 (2014).

Marvel Comics (New York).</ref>\n\n==Other versions==\n===House of M===\nIn the alternate reality seen in the 2005 [[House of M]] storyline, Howard Stark was alive while Maria Stark's status is unknown. Howard turned over control of the company to Tony Stark when his son turned sixteen. Although officially listed as retired, he worked with Tony to build an armor capable of taking on the [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinels]] and powerful [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutants]] during the conflict.<ref name=\"House of M: Iron Man #1\">''House of M: Iron Man'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nHoward and Tony began to work on Sentinels with [[Forge (comics)|Forge]] and [[Beast (comics)|Henry McCoy]] after being awarded them an exclusive contract.

Magneto suddenly appeared and personally dealt with Howard, killing him.<ref>''House of M: Iron Man'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n===Ultimate Marvel===\n[[File:Howard Stark.jpg|right|thumb|Howard Stark in ''[[Ultimate Iron Man (comics)|Ultimate Iron Man]]''. Art by [[Andy Kubert]].]]\nThe [[Ultimate Marvel]] version of Howard Stark is shown dealing with his second wife Maria Cerrera suffering a genetic accident while the brilliant scientist was pregnant. After Maria died during childbirth, Howard uses a newly invented biological armor to save the life of their son [[Antonio Stark|Antonio \"Tony\" Stark]]. A few years later, his business rival Zebediah Stane kidnaps and tortures Tony to attempt to learn how to manufacture the bio-armor for his own personal gain. Not long afterwards, Howard arrives with a SWAT team and arrests Zebediah. After the incident, a transparent version of the armor is developed, and Tony begins attending a prep school. This leads to Tony developing a prototype power-armor and befriending fellow student [[War Machine|James Rhodes]].<ref name=\"Ultimate Iron Man #2\">''Ultimate Iron Man'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> After finding out that bullies were ordered from an unknown individual to kill Tony, Howard decides to enroll his son Tony, Rhodes, and Nifara into the Baxter Building, where [[Iron Monger|Obadiah Stane]] (Zebediah Stane's son) was also enrolled. Shortly after their arrival, Tony and Howard witness Obadiah murdering a pair of students and make it look like an accident. Howard sees Tony make his first Iron Man armor with the intent to punish Obadiah.<ref name=\"Ultimate Iron Man #2\"/> Sometime later, Howard was arrested based on planted evidence (by Obadiah) for Zebediah's murder. While the elder Stark was wrongly imprisoned for Zebediah's murder, his teenage son is forced to run Stark Enterprises. When Obadiah drugs a prison guard with a \"hypnotizing bio-drug\", the guard tries to kill Howard but fails. Howard is shot in the process and ends up in ICU.<ref>''Ultimate Iron Man'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> While his son Tony is trying to fix all of his current problems, Howard recovered enough to go to prison, but the guards sent to escort him were not sent by the Police Department. Howard fights them off and escapes. Tony meets with him and thinks Loni (Howard's first wife and Obadiah's mother) is the mastermind behind the scenes trying to kill them all. Tony, Rhodes, Nifara, Howard, and Obadiah set off to Utah to find Loni. They arrive and their chopper explodes injuring Rhodes. Obadiah falls off a cliff, but Tony catches him as terrorists arrive on the scene. Tony flees, but follows them as they take Obadiah to Loni Stark and their hideout. Tony breaks into the compound and Loni floods it with poison gas trying to kill him, abandoning Obadiah. Tony saves Obadiah, but Howard and Nifara are taken captive by Loni. After Loni kills Nifara, she confesses to Howard that all she ever wanted was power, hence why she married Howard, divorced him, remarried with Zebediah, had Obadiah, and later had Zebediah killed.<ref>''Ultimate Iron Man'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> Tony shows up, and Loni shoots Howard in the chest, threatening to shoot him again if he doesn't take the suit off. Tony takes off his Iron Man armor, and Loni shoots him in the head, not knowing that his entire body is a brain and will heal itself. Tony fights Loni, beats her, and tends to his father. Obadiah, mad that his mom abandoned him for dead with the poison gas, enters the room and kills her. Tony, Obadiah and Howard are all picked up by the feds and go home.<ref>''Ultimate Iron Man 2'' #5.

In addition to being Gregory Stark's father, he is the founder of Stark Enterprises, but sought help from Chinese conglomerate [[Mandarin (comics)|Mandarin International]]. While his son Tony Stark is trying to start a company of his own along with girlfriend Josie Gardner, Howard continually tries to persuade Tony to take his place as the CEO which his son eventually does after Josie's death.<ref>''Ultimate Comics: Iron Man'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nThe Ultimate version of Howard Stark Sr., created by [[Warren Ellis]] and Steve Kurth, and first appeared in ''[[Ultimate Comics: Armor Wars]]'' #4 (April 2010), is an equivalent of [[Titanium Man]] which also resembles [[Iron Monger]] as well. Having faked his own death, he went to work for \"Project Tomorrow\" to create human/machine hybrids, such as himself and the [[Arsenal (Marvel Comics)|Arsenal Units]]. Desiring an \"upgrade\" for himself, Howard hired [[Ghost (Marvel Comics)|Ghost]] and [[Justine Hammer]] to steal upgrades from [[Iron Man (Ultimate Marvel character)|Iron Man]]'s lab. After Remnant 242's theft, Howard (confused about what the item can do) forces his subordinates to have answers, eventually coercing his grandson to unlock Remnant 242 but is surprised to instead discover a mechanism that could shut down and destroy machinery, which caused Howard to die instantly without his damaged machine body.<ref>''Ultimate Comics: Armor Wars'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n===Marvel Noir===\nIn the [[Marvel Noir]] miniseries ''Iron Man Noir'', set in the 1930s, Howard Stark is believed to have been killed by [[Nazi Party|Nazi]] agents. It is eventually revealed that he was subjected to chemical brainwashing by the Nazis and became that reality's version of [[Baron Zemo]]. Under this guise, he builds [[Arsenal (Marvel Comics)|war machines]] for the Nazis based on original designs he shared with Tony at a very young age. He dies when Iron Man destroys [[Baron Strucker|Baron von Strucker]]'s airship.<ref>''Iron Man Noir'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n===Iron Inquisitor===\nAs part of Mephisto's campaign against the Avengers with the aid of his multiversal counterparts, one of the many alternate reality allies he recruited is a version of Howard Stark from Earth-4111 who made a deal with Mephisto for eternal power and immortality.<ref>''Avengers'' (vol. 8) #31. Marvel Comics.</ref> Howard became enthralled to the Council of Red, to the point where he killed his son as part of the terms of the deal, and became the Iron Inquisitor, working as Hell's prime weaponer. As the Iron Inquisitor, he enacts Mephisto's will across the multiverse as his special agent.<ref>''Avengers'' (vol. 8) #50. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nFar from Avengers Mountain, Multiversal [[Masters of Evil]] members [[Doom Supreme]] and Kid Thanos meet up with Iron Inquisitor and Mephisto in the form of a dog as he nears the corpse of Orb. At one point, Kid Thanos insults Iron Inquisitor by claiming that his armor resembled a crustacean's shell. As Doom Supreme and Kid Thanos enter a portal to meet with their teammates and get back to work, Mephisto and Iron Inquisitor talk about what to do with the Multiversal Masters of Evil as Mephisto's dog form eats at the fragments of Uatu's eye.<ref>''Avengers'' (vol. 8) #54.
