The character also appears in a number of movies, television, and video game adaptations. The character was created by [[Jack Kirby]] and first appeared in the [[comic book]] ''[[Fantastic Four (comic book)|Fantastic Four]]'' #48, published in 1966.\n\nThe Silver Surfer is a humanoid alien with metallic skin who can travel through space with the aid of his [[surfboard]]-like craft. Originally a young [[astronomer]] named '''Norrin Radd''' on the planet Zenn-La, he saved his homeworld from the [[planet]] devourer, [[Galactus]], by serving as his herald.

Now known as the Silver Surfer, he roamed the [[cosmos]] searching for planets for Galactus to consume. When his travels took him to [[Earth]], he met the [[Fantastic Four]], who helped him rediscover his nobility of spirit.

The comic's writer-editor, [[Stan Lee]], and its [[penciller]] and co-plotter, [[Jack Kirby]], had, by the mid-1960s, developed a collaborative technique known as the \"[[Marvel Method]]\": the two would discuss story ideas, Kirby working from a brief synopsis to draw the individual scenes and plot details, with Lee finally adding the dialogue and captions. When Kirby turned in his pencil art for the story, he included a new character he and Lee had not discussed.<ref name=\"Markstein\">{{cite web\n | last = Markstein\n | first = Don\n | title = The Silver Surfer\n | url=http://www.toonopedia.com/surfer.htm\n | access-date = 2007-03-26 }}</ref> As Lee recalled in 1995, \"There, in the middle of the story we had so carefully worked out, was a nut on some sort of flying surfboard\".<ref name=\"excerpt\">{{cite web\n |last       = Lee\n |first      = Stan\n |title      = The Ultimate Silver Surfer (Berkeley Trade, 1995)\n |url        = http://www.whatsleft.com/reviews/books/SurferExcerpt.html\n |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/19970413082350/http://whatsleft.com/reviews/books/SurferExcerpt.html\n |url-status   = dead\n |archive-date = 1997-04-13\n |access-date = 2007-01-05\n}}</ref> He later expanded on this, recalling, \"I thought, 'Jack, this time you've gone too far'\".<ref>[[Mark Evanier|Evanier, Mark]].

The Silver Surfer soon became a key part of the unfolding story.<ref name=\"Markstein\"/>\n\nFollowing the Surfer's debut, Lee and Kirby brought him back as a recurring guest in ''Fantastic Four'' #55\u201361, 72, and 74\u201377 (ranging Oct. 1966 \u2013 Aug. 1968). The character made his solo debut in the backup story of ''Fantastic Four Annual'' #5 (Nov. 1967).\n\nThe following year, Lee launched the solo title ''The Silver Surfer''.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wells |first1=John |title=American Comic Book Chronicles: 1965-1969 |date=2014 |publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing |isbn=978-1605490557 |pages=195\u2013196}}</ref> [[John Buscema]] was penciller for the first 17 issues of the series, with Kirby returning for the 18th and final issue. The first seven issues, which included anthological \"Tales of the Watcher\" backup stories, were 72-page (with advertising), 25-cent \"giants\", as opposed to the typical 36-page, 12-cent comics of the time. Thematically, the stories dealt with the Surfer's exile on Earth and the inhumanity of man as observed by this noble yet fallen hero. Though short-lived, the series became known as one of Lee's most thoughtful and introspective works.<ref name=\"silversurfer2v3backcover\">Marvel Comics writer [[Steve Englehart]], for example, in his back-cover text for ''The Silver Surfer'' vol. 3, #2 (Aug. 1987), wrote that Buscema and Lee were \"pouring their souls into the series\".</ref>\n\nFollowing his series' cancellation, the Surfer made sporadic appearances as a guest star or [[antagonist]] in such comic books as ''[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]'', ''[[Defenders (comics)|The Defenders]]'', and ''Fantastic Four''.

This first issue was shelved and a brand new first issue was written, to set up this plot twist; the original first issue would ultimately be reprinted in ''Marvel Fanfare'' #51. The series marked the first Silver Surfer stories not written by Stan Lee, a fact which Lee was openly unhappy about. He explained: {{blockquote|After I gave up [[Spider-Man]] then someone else did Spider-Man, and someone else did the [[Fantastic Four]] and [[Doctor Strange]] and the [[X-Men]] and all of them. I felt that it was kind of nice for me to have been the only writer of the Silver Surfer, so I felt a little bit disappointed when somebody else did it. I would have liked to have been the only person. Had I known they were absolutely going to have the book done, I would have ''found'' the time to do it myself. I didn't really have time but I would have ''made'' the time, rather than have anybody else do it. ... this is not at all a criticism of Steve [Englehart] or of Marshall [Rogers, artist on the series], it's just that it's one book that I would have liked to have always done myself.

However, issues regarding Englehart wanting to use his Avengers character [[Mantis (Marvel Comics)|Mantis]] as Silver Surfer's companion, as well as editorial refusing to let him use Thanos or other concepts conceived by [[Jim Starlin]], led Englehart to leave the book with issue #31. Starlin took over as writer with issue #34 after several fill-in issues, and incorporated Thanos, Adam Warlock, and Drax the Destroyer into the series.\n\nUnder Jim Starlin and later Ron Marz, the series would receive acclaim and sales boost due to Silver Surfer's involvement with Starlin's Infinity Trilogy, with [[George P\u00e9rez]] and [[J. M. DeMatteis]] also having brief writing stints on the series as well. Additional artists included [[Tom Grindberg]], [[Ron Garney]], and [[Jon J. Muth]], as well as periodic guest spots by [[John Buscema]]. The title experienced great initial success which allowed Marvel to push the character into other media, including a 1990 [[video game]], 1992 [[trading card]] set, and 1998 [[animated series]], as well as spinning off a variety of other comics series including ''Cosmic Powers'', ''Cosmic Powers Unlimited'', ''Captain Marvel'' vol. 2, and ''Star Masters''. It ran 146 issues, through 1998. The next year it was followed by the two-issue [[miniseries]], ''Silver Surfer: Loftier Than Mortals''.\n\nA two-issue ''Silver Surfer'' miniseries (later collected as ''Silver Surfer: Parable''), scripted by Lee and drawn by [[Jean Giraud|Moebius]], was published through Marvel's [[Epic Comics]] imprint in 1988 and 1989. Because of inconsistencies with other stories, it has been argued that these stories actually feature an alternate Silver Surfer from a parallel Earth.<ref>{{cite web\n | author = marvunapp.com\n | title = Earth-Moebius entry on the Appendix to the Marvel Universe website (not affiliated with Marvel)\n | url=http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/earthmoeb01.htm\n | access-date = 2007-04-20 }}</ref> This miniseries won the [[Eisner Award]] for [[Eisner Award#Best Finite Series/Limited Series|best finite/limited series]] in 1989.\n\n===2000s===\nA new ongoing Silver Surfer series began in 2003, focusing on the character's alien nature and messianic allegory.

When the Surfer and the [[Fantastic Four]] realized this, the Surfer put it to the test by leaving the board planet-side and entering space in the Four's spacecraft. Once he was free of Earth, the Surfer remotely converted the board to energy, recalled it to him, and reformed it in space.<ref name=\"silversurfer1v3\"/>\n\nThe Surfer has displayed the ability to shed his silver skin and revert to his original appearance as Norrin Radd, masking the Power Cosmic and allowing him to be more inconspicuous when needed. In this state, he can properly eat, drink and sleep.<ref>''Silver Surfer'' vol. 7, #3 (Aug. 2014). Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n==Other versions==\n===Ultimate Marvel===\n[[Warren Ellis]]'s ''[[Ultimate Galactus Trilogy]]'' originally suggested that the [[Ultimates]]' ally the [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]] was the herald of Galactus, a robotic probe that travels through space warning civilizations of the impending arrival of [[Gah Lak Tus]]. In the final miniseries of the trilogy, ''[[Ultimate Extinction]]'', silvery humanoids began to appear, sent to trigger mass suicides in order to reduce the population's resistance. Suicide cults founded by the creatures began to appear all across the globe as Gah Lak Tus drew near. These silvery beings had the ability to grow wings; morph into an [[oval|ovoid]]; form spikes; or take an intermediary form, gliding on an oval surface. They also demonstrated the ability to manipulate large quantities of energy.\n\nIn ''[[Ultimate Fantastic Four]]'' #42, another Ultimate incarnation of the Silver Surfer appears, called the '''Silver Searcher'''. He is teleported to Earth after Reed mistakes him for a star that he is trying to harness. His appearance triggers planet-wide chaos and natural calamities. In #43, [[Maker (Reed Richards)|Reed]] comments that Gah Lak Tus seems to have modeled its drones on this surfer, and he gives his name as Norin Radd. The Searcher states that he will summon his \"master\", who will make the population of the Earth happier than they have ever been.<ref name=\"ultimateff43\">''Ultimate Fantastic Four'' #43 (May 2007). Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nIn #44, the Surfer's master is revealed to be Zenn-La's ruler, Revka Temerlune Edifex Scyros III, \"the king without enemies\", who uses mind-control to make the population of Earth worship him (before it takes effect on the Fantastic Four, the [[Human Torch]] calls him \"[[Psycho-Man]]\"). It is revealed that the Surfer has been exiled from Zenn-La for destroying the control that Psycho-Man had over Zenn-La, but because of finding Earth for his master to \"save\" he may return. After Psycho-Man gains domain over Earth, the Silver Surfer, temporarily imprisoned in his own 'memorial' statue, rescues Mr. Fantastic, tells him his story, and asks him to save Earth. The Surfer then helps the Fantastic Four defeat other Surfer-like assassins of Psycho-Man. With the Surfers beaten and the insane Psycho-Man reprogrammed to experience the unthinking happiness he had imposed on others, Silver Surfer wanders the space ways.\n\nIn ''[[Ultimate X-Men]]'', [[Jean Grey#Ultimate Jean Grey/Marvel Girl|Jean Grey]] as [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix]] travels through space and is stopped by what is named as \"A Silver Surfer\". He informs Phoenix that the [[Watcher (comics)|Watchers]] disapprove of the problems her flight across the universe is causing and briefly battles her before asking what she is looking for.<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #96 (July 2008). Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n===Exiles===\nOn Earth 552, Norrin Radd had been a great military scientist who accidentally destroyed his own world with his greatest invention. Determined to bring it back to existence, he approached [[Galactus#Exiles|Galactus]], Restorer of Worlds, and became his herald in the hope that Galactus would resurrect his world in exchange for his service. However, Galactus had taken an oath to only revive those worlds destroyed by the Blight. An enraged Silver Surfer then turned against his master, destroying those who worshiped him and attempting to kill Galactus himself in order to steal the knowledge of world restoration. This led to the destruction of Earth, the coming of the [[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]], the deaths of the [[Shi'ar]] Imperial Elite Guard, and inevitably the Surfer's own destruction at the claws of a cosmically empowered [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]].<ref name=\"exiles87\">{{cite web\n | author = marvel.com\n | title = The Marvel catalog for Exiles #87\n | url=http://www.marvel.com/catalog/?book_id=5244\n | access-date = 2007-05-10 }}</ref><ref name=\"exiles88\">{{cite web\n | author = marvel.com\n | title = The Marvel catalog for Exiles #88\n | url=http://www.marvel.com/catalog/?book_id=5546\n | access-date = 2007-05-10 }}</ref>\n\n===Marvel Zombies===\nThe Silver Surfer remains uninfected in the ''[[Marvel Zombies]]'' on [[Earth-2149]]. Instead of coming to Earth and meeting the Fantastic Four, he is attacked by a horde of zombies. After fighting valiantly, he is killed by the [[Alternative versions of the Hulk#Marvel Zombies|Hulk]], and his body is devoured by a few of the zombies (Hulk, [[Captain America|Colonel America]], [[Hank Pym|Giant-Man]], [[Iron Man]], [[Luke Cage]], [[Alternative versions of Wolverine#Marvel Zombies|Wolverine]], and [[Alternative versions of Spider-Man#Marvel Zombies Spider-Man (Earth-2149)|Spider-Man]]). His corpse grants the zombies a portion each of his cosmic powers, which they use to kill all of the other zombie heroes and villains whom they consider \"competition\" for what's left of the living. Afterwards, Pym creates a machine that concentrates the Cosmic powers they all share to create a massive blast that kills [[Galactus#Marvel Zombies|Galactus]], at which point they eat him. Now imbued with the power of Galactus himself (and realizing they can now fly and survive in space), they adopt his role, traveling the universe and picking worlds clean of life.<ref name=\"marvelzombies5\">''Marvel Zombies'' #5'' (April 2006). Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n===MC2===\nDuring the finale of ''[[Last Planet Standing]]'', the Silver Surfer foils Galactus's plan to create a new Big Bang, merging with Galactus himself in the process to become a new being. Gaining control of Galactus's powers, the new entity undoes the damage done by the old Galactus.<ref name=\"lastplanetstanding5\">''Last Planet Standing'' #5 (July 2006). Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n===The Keeper===\nIn the [[alternate history|alternate timeline]] of Earth-691, notably the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (1969 team)|''Guardians of the Galaxy'']] issues #24 and #25 [[story arc]], Norrin Radd was featured as The Keeper. This new version of the Silver Surfer, sans his surfboard, had [[Quasar (comics)|Quantum Bands]], which augmented his \"Power Cosmic\" and designated him as the Protector of the Universe, as with other bearers of the Bands before him. He works with the Guardians in an attempt to kill Galactus once and for all, his first attempt with [[Firelord (comics)|Firelord]] and Dargo-Thor having failed. Eventually, the Keeper realizes that, with his augmented power, he can supply Galactus with the energy he needs and end the Planet-Eater's consumption of worlds. Eon, cosmic being and creator of the Quantum Bands, reveals that this was the ultimate purpose of the Keeper becoming the Protector of the Universe, and he enters into a symbiotic partnership with Galactus, who accepts the Keeper as an equal; he is last seen leaving with Galactus, riding a silver surfboard once more.\n\n===Earth X===\nIn issue 11 and 12 of the ''[[Earth X]]'' series, [[Black Bolt]] calls upon [[Galactus#Earth X|Galactus]] to come destroy the [[Celestial (comics)|Celestial]] seed growing within Earth. The Silver Surfer accompanies him along with his love Shalla-Bal, who had now been turned into a silver herald of Galactus as well.\n\n===Green Lantern/Silver Surfer: Unholy Alliances===\nIn ''Green Lantern/Silver Surfer: Unholy Alliances'', the Silver Surfer confronts [[Hank Henshaw|Cyborg Superman]] over the destruction of a planet and is met by [[Parallax (comics)|Parallax]]. Parallax beats the Cyborg, but the Silver Surfer lets him go and tries to sympathize with Parallax. The two return to Earth to find [[Kyle Rayner]] with Thanos, leading them to believe they formed an alliance when in reality Thanos tricked Kyle. Kyle convinces the Surfer to help him stop Parallax and Thanos from destroying the universe and that he was duped into giving Thanos Oa's power. The Surfer similarly gave most of his power to Parallax to reform the destroyed planet, forcing Kyle to use his ring to drain both villains of their enhanced powers before they can destroy everything. Unable to contain the power himself, Kyle channels the power from the two villains into the Silver Surfer, who opens a portal and sucks the two inside.<ref>''Green Lantern/Silver Surfer: Unholy Alliances'' one-shot. DC Comics/Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n===What If?===\nSilver Surfer was featured in different issues of ''[[What If (comics)|What If?]]''\n\n* One issue of ''What If?'' revolving around ''[[Atlantis Attacks]]'' had Silver Surfer and Quasar as the survivors of an attack by Set. With the help of Thor (who is horribly burned and placed in stasis to keep him alive), Silver Surfer and Quasar destroy two of Set's heads before Quasar (empowered by the Uni-Power) sacrifices his freedom to exile himself and Set inside Doctor Strange's Eye of Agamotto. Silver Surfer gives the Eye of Agamotto to Uatu the Watcher for safekeeping as Set's children are born.<ref>''What If?'' vol. 2 #25. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n* Another issue of ''What If?'' revolved around the Cosmic Carnage where the Carnage symbiote remained bonded to the Surfer, forcing Spider-Man and the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] to battle him until [[Firestar (Marvel Comics)|Firestar]] was able to use her powers to disrupt the symbiote's control over the Surfer. After his powers were used to destroy dozens of New York City blocks and realizing that there was only one way to stop the symbiote, the Silver Surfer flew himself into the sun, seemingly destroying both himself and the creature.<ref>''What If?'' vol. 2 #108. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n* In ''What If?'' vol. 2 #49, the title is \"What If the Silver Surfer Possessed the Infinity Gauntlet?\" In the original [[The Infinity Gauntlet|Infinity Gauntlet]] story arc, the Silver Surfer plays the role of messenger, having witnessed firsthand the resurrection of [[Thanos]] and the beginning of his quest to obtain the six [[Infinity Gems]] (as told in ''[[The Thanos Quest]]'' miniseries). In this issue, the story of the Gauntlet is partially retold and shows Thanos in space with the Gauntlet, ruling over all existence. In the original Infinity Gauntlet story, [[Nebula (comics)|Nebula]] intercepts the gauntlet from Thanos; however, in ''What If?'' vol. 2 #49, the Surfer takes the gauntlet and wears it himself. Initially, the Surfer tries to use the gauntlet for good, but ultimately the supreme power of the gauntlet forces the Surfer to destroy it in order to avoid becoming corrupted by it. Prior to destroying the gauntlet, the Surfer creates a distant planet for himself and [[Shalla Bal]] (his wife) to reside on for all time and the Surfer returns to his mortal form of Norrin Radd. This story is told from the perspective of the [[Watcher (comics)|Watcher]] who continually observes the universe and refuses to interfere in the natural unfolding of things.\n\n===Ruins===\nIn [[Warren Ellis]]'s ''[[Ruins (comics)|Ruins]]'', the Silver Surfer is briefly seen when described by [[Captain Marvel (Mar-Vell)|Mar-Vell]] to reporter [[Phil Sheldon]]. When the Kree Liberation Force set forth to invade Earth, they found the floating mutilated corpse of the Surfer near Earth's moon. Mar-Vell says that he and his comrades concluded that the Surfer had been driven mad because of his lack of need for oxygen and clawed open his chest in order to expose his lungs to the atmosphere, but died of shock.<ref>''Ruins'' #1 (August 1995).

This persona takes control of the Surfer in the second half of season 2. As the Dark Surfer, he steals the [[Infinity Gems|Infinity Gauntlet]] from Thanos, seals him up in the Soul Gem, and combines its power with that of the first season's powerful item of focus, the Infinity Sword. Then he uses the power of both items to destroy two-thirds of the universe, separate the members of the Squad across the multiverse, and send Earth farther away from the Sun, so the planet could freeze to death. Once the Squad reunites, they make it their goal to stop the Dark Surfer. In the final episode, his Dark Surfer persona is destroyed and he is purified when his powerful items are shattered into numerous Infinity Fractals and spread across the universe, all while repairing the damage the Dark Surfer caused. Back to normal, the Silver Surfer apologizes for his behavior as the Dark Surfer and he promises to rejoin the Squad, after he pays his debt.\n* Silver Surfer appears in the ''[[Hulk and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H.]]'' episode \"Fear Itself\", voiced by [[Brent Spiner]].<ref name=\"BTVA\"/> There is a reference by the [[Hulk]] that Silver Surfer is an old friend.
