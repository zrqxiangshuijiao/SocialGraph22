The next night, however, Sam's father is killed trying to break up a neighborhood fight (originally Paul was said to have been killed when Sam was 9 years old).<ref>''Captain America'' #277</ref> Two years later, his mother is shot and killed by a mugger one block from their apartment.<ref>Johns, Geoff.

''Captain America and the Falcon'', #11</ref> The once-peaceful island had been taken over by the Exiles, a group of would-be world conquerors who had collaborated with the [[Nazi]] [[supervillain]] the [[Red Skull]] during [[World War II]]. They had been betrayed by the Red Skull and were forced to remain in hiding on the island, enslaving the natives. Wilson finds and befriends {{anchor|Redwing}}Redwing, a falcon with which he feels a remarkably strong bond.<ref>''Captain America'' #186</ref>\n\n===Becoming the Falcon===\nWilson is an upright and cheerful [[social worker]] who is eventually lured to the Exiles' island and organizes the natives to fight for their freedom.

By this point, Falcon had discovered that he could extend his telepathic bond with Redwing, allowing him to control other birds and \"see\" through their eyes. He uses this ability to spy on Henry Gyrich (now the Avengers' liaison with the United Nations) and discovers that the United States' Secretary of Defense, Dell Rusk, has been pressuring Gyrich to spy on the Avengers and turn over their secrets. Although initially hostile to one another, Falcon convinces Gyrich to help the Avengers spy on Rusk, feeding him false information while gathering evidence to expose him. They discover that Rusk is actually the Red Skull, who has launched a biological weapon attack on the United States, intending to use the ensuing panic to gain control over America's government and start a war with other countries. Falcon is instrumental in defeating the Red Skull.<ref>Johns, Geoff. ''The Avengers'' vol. 3 #57\u201370</ref>\n\nIt is around this period of time that, a new \"Captain America\" secretly created by the [[Office of Naval Intelligence]] (O.N.I.) goes rogue and begins eliminating anything and anyone he sees as a source of terrorism. To draw out this agent (dubbed \"The [[Anti-Cap]]\"), O.N.I. leaks information about their involvement in a [[biological weapons]] project with the notorious Rivas Family, powerful Cuban drug lords. Reporter and social activist Leila Taylor investigates this rumor and attempts to smuggle a sample of the virus into America, but she is arrested by U.S. forces in Cuba. Falcon, who is a friend of Taylor, breaks her out of prison and investigates her claims, destroying the Rivas Family's biological weapons lab and obtaining a sample of the mysterious virus they were developing for O.N.I. Falcon is able to fly Leila back to America (although his flying harness is destroyed in a hurricane) while Captain America follows Falcon's directions and retrieves the virus sample. The Anti-Cap kills the head of the Rivas family, and pursues Leila, Falcon, and Cap, intent on obtaining the virus sample. After reuniting, Falcon and Captain America are able to barely defeat the Anti-Cap. Realizing that O.N.I.'s goal was to draw out their rogue agent to execute him, Captain America arranges to have the Anti-Cap secretly imprisoned in the Wakandan embassy until O.N.I. agrees not to kill him.<ref>Priest, Christopher J. ''Captain America and the Falcon'' #1\u20134, (May\u2013July 2004)</ref>\n\nSince Captain America and Falcon now possess both O.N.I.'s rogue agent and the last remaining sample of O.N.I.'s virus, O.N.I. begins to put increasing amounts of pressure on the heroes. Falcon is especially targeted \u2013 he had broken Leila out of Federal Custody, and his alleged criminal history makes it easier for O.N.I. to create further false charges against him. Falcon soon finds himself on the run from O.N.I.{{issue|date=August 2015}}\n\nMeanwhile, the superheroine the [[Scarlet Witch]], having gone insane, begins using her powers to re-create many of the Avengers' greatest trials and tragedies. She destabilizes the Falcon's mind, causing him to act increasingly like the \"Snap Wilson\" persona. He begins carrying a gun, keeps secrets from his friends, assaults Leila's boyfriend Norman when he protests they go into hiding, and uses a high power rifle to shoot at his friend [[Robbie Robertson (comics)|Robbie Robertson]] (to fool Robbie into thinking O.N.I. was threatening to kill him). Although they succeed in exposing the illegal activities of O.N.I. and clear Wilson's name, Sam's methods cause his relationship with Captain America to become strained. Cap confronts Falcon about his recent actions, and Falcon, angered at what he sees as an ultimatum, terminates their partnership. As they are walking away, Norman (who blames Falcon for the end of his relationship with Leila) appears and shoots at Falcon. Captain America is seriously injured by the stray bullets, and even appears to die. The shock of watching his best friend seemingly die because of his actions has a powerful effect on Sam, who briefly gives up being Falcon and reexamines his life.<ref>Priest, Christopher J.

Months later, Wilson watches a TV broadcast about former New Warrior [[Rage (comics)|Rage]] engaging in a fight with the [[Americop]]s, a private police force funded by Keane Industries, in [[Brooklyn]]. Intending to stop the fight, Wilson, along with Redwing and Falcon, try to contain the situation. Sam manages to stop the fight, although not without fighting the Americops, for which he knew the media would portray him negatively. As he leaves, he is attacked from behind by [[U.S. Agent (comics)|U.S. Agent]]. After a brief argument, Captain America and U.S. Agent begin to fight, with U.S. Agent gaining the upper hand, until Sam drags him into a tunnel where the darkness and the great horned owls that reside in it allow him to win the fight.{{issue|date=February 2019}} After defeating U.S. Agent and receiving an argument from Rage, Wilson returns to his headquarters where he decides to put a tiny implant in his brain that will enhance his ability to see what birds see, enabling him to transmit them into a data storage facility that converts them into images and videos. He decides to further investigate the Americops to find proof of their violent activities.<ref>''Captain America: Sam Wilson'' #10-13. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nWhile accompanying Steve Rogers on a mission to stop [[Flag-Smasher]] from leaking America's nuclear launch codes, Wilson fails to save a senator from being shot by the villain, further compromising his current public image. This is subsequently revealed to have been deliberately staged by Rogers who has been converted to believe he is a Hydra sleeper agent since childhood. Using his greater familiarity with the shield, Rogers deliberately put Wilson in a position where he would be unable to use the shield to save the senator, with the final goal of demoralizing Sam to the point where he will return the shield to Rogers of his own free will (not wanting to kill Wilson and risk creating a martyr).<ref>''Captain America: Sam Wilson'' #14. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nAfter discovering that Rage was arrested and accused of robbing a pawn shop which [[Man Mountain Marko]] and [[Speed Demon (comics)|Speed Demon]] committed, Sam offers him professional help from other heroes, but Rage turns it down, preferring that he should be the one to prove his innocence. After consulting with his brother and Rogers, Sam posts a video on the internet showing footage of the Americops beating up Rage, exposing their violent activities. During Rage's trial, a frustrated Sam leaves the courtroom and captures Speed Demon, who confesses to his and Man Mountain Marko's involvement in the pawn shop robbery. Upon returning to the court, Misty tells Sam that the verdict was already given. While people protest over Rage's arrest, Sam tries his best to calm them. Sam leaves a letter which explains he is ending his role as Captain America and returning the shield to Steve Rogers<ref>''Captain America: Sam Wilson'' #18-21. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nDuring the 2017 \"[[Secret Empire (comics)|Secret Empire]]\" storyline, Sam has spent time alone in a desert and returns to the city where he discovers Hydra's takeover of America and that Steve Rogers is their leader. Sam rescues a woman and her [[Inhumans|Inhuman]] daughter from Hydra enforcers, Sam reluctantly helps them to safety. He reunites with Misty Knight and Demolition Man and helps smuggle other Inhumans out of the country. He helps [[Ant-Man (Scott Lang)|Ant-Man]] smuggle his daughter [[Cassandra Lang]] then declines their offer to join the underground resistance.<ref>''Captain America: Sam Wilson'' #22</ref> When Hawkeye and the Tony Stark A.I. reveal that Kobik was responsible for Steve's change, Sam agrees to help smuggle them out of the country so they can find the Cosmic Cube's fragments.<ref>''Secret Empire'' #3</ref> Sam takes the group through an abandoned subway tunnel where they encounter [[Mole Man]], with whom Sam strikes a deal when they are attacked by Dreadnoughts sent by Hydra.

They encounter Steve Rogers and his Avengers until Ultron captures them. After a brief battle, Ultron allows them to leave and gives the shard to Tony's team. Steve muses that he is unconcerned about who will acquire the fragments as he has an inside man in the Tony Stark A.I.'s team.<ref>''Secret Empire'' #4</ref>\n\nAfter a series of dead ends, the team returns to the hideout, where Sam reunites with Misty, until Hydra forces arrive and begin their assault on the base. During the battle, Sam helps the other heroes in protecting the refugees and battling Hydra's Avengers and a revived Bruce Banner as the Hulk until the base explodes.<ref>''Secret Empire'' #5-6</ref> In the aftermath of the attack, Sam appears standing on top of the rubble as Captain America to inspire America's superheroes to not surrender.<ref>''Secret Empire'' #7</ref> It is later revealed that Sam had a conversation with Misty Knight and Rayshaun Lucas, the new [[Patriot (comics)|Patriot]], which has persuaded him to reassume the role of Captain America, leading the resistance and wielding Rogers' original round shield as a symbol of hope.<ref>''Captain America: Sam Wilson'' #24</ref> Sam uses the Cosmic Cube fragment acquired by the resistance to help destroy the Darkforce dome surrounding Manhattan and the planetary defense shield, releasing all the trapped heroes. Liberating all the imprisoned Inhumans, the Underground attacks the Capitol which attracts the attention of Steve Rogers, who arrives wearing Cosmic Cube-powered armor. During the final battle, Sam fakes surrender and gives the fragment to Steve, only for Winter Soldier to intervene and bring Kobik and the real Steve Rogers back. The restored Steve Rogers manages to defeat the Hydra Steve Rogers with Thor's hammer and Kobik restores reality back to normal.<ref>''Secret Empire'' #8-10</ref>\n\n===Return as Falcon===\nUpon taking the second [[Patriot (comics)|Patriot]] on as his sidekick, they travel to [[Chicago]] to deal with an outbreak of gang violence, unaware that [[Blackheart]] is posing as the city's Mayor.<ref>[[Barnes, Rodney]]; Thompson, Robbie (w), Cassara, Joshua; [[Bagley, Mark]] (p), Hennessy, Andrew (i). (Anthology), ''Falcon'' vol. 2 #1 (Dec. 2017). Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n==Powers, abilities, and equipment==\n===Powers===\nIn his earliest appearances, Wilson exhibits a close bond with his bird Redwing, which is confirmed as being a telepathic link by [[Professor X]] in ''Captain America'' #174. The [[Red Skull]] later claims that he had used the [[Cosmic Cube]] to create a \"super-normal mental link\" between Sam Wilson and Redwing.<ref>Englehart, Steve. ''Captain America'' #186. Marvel Comics, 1975</ref> Falcon later recalled memories of such an experience, stating he \"Hurt like hell. Being mentally fused with that falcon. Able to see through his eyes\".<ref>Johns, Geoff. ''The Avengers'' vol. 3 #60. Marvel Comics, 2003</ref>\n\nWilson eventually revealed that he has been able to extend this empathic link. \"I'm always psychically connected with Redwing, but through concentration, i've recently tapped into another ability - i'm able to link-up with other birds. I have over six billion pairs of eyes in the United States alone\". He used this ability to quickly search New York City when the criminal [[Scarecrow (Marvel Comics)|Scarecrow]] kidnapped two children,<ref>Johns, Geoff. ''The Avengers'' vol. 3 #64. Marvel Comics, 2003</ref> as well as to spy on Senator Dell Rusk (actually the Red Skull in disguise) and Henry Peter Gyrich.<ref>Johns, Geoff. ''The Avengers'' vol. 3 #61\u201369. Marvel Comics, 2003\u20132004</ref> He is also apparently able to access the memories of birds, and see things they had witnessed in the past (although birds have a different concept of the passage of time, which makes it difficult for him to know when any events they witnessed occurred).<ref>Brubaker, Ed. ''Captain America'' vol. 5 #35. Marvel Comics, 2008</ref>\n\n===Abilities===\nWilson is a skilled hand-to-hand combatant, having been trained in [[Judo]]<ref>''Captain America and the Falcon'' #163 (July 1973)</ref> and [[Karate]]<ref>''Captain America'' #118 (Oct. 1969)</ref> by Steve Rogers. Wilson is also highly skilled in the use of [[Captain America's shield]].{{issue|date=May 2018}}\n\n===Uniform and flight harness===\nWilson's original Falcon wing harness featured detachable jet-powered glider wings made of lightweight titanium ribbing and Mylar. The wings were covered with wafer-thin solar power receptors that convert sunlight into electricity to power miniature high-speed electric turbine fans in his uniform and boots. The wings detached and reattached to his uniform cybernetically. The harness was destroyed in ''[[Captain America and the Falcon]]'' #2 (2004). The uniform was made of synthetic stretch fabric lined with a steel-alloy mesh.{{Issue|date=June 2008}}\n\nAfter the original flying harness's destruction in a 2004 storyline,<ref>Priest, Christopher (w). ''Captain America and the Falcon'' #2 (2004). Marvel Comics</ref> the [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]] supplied Falcon with a new costume and wings. An emitter array on Falcon's back creates holographic \"hard light\" wings with a maximum wingspan of up to {{convert|50|ft|m}}. Controlled by a cybernetic link, the wings can be instantly reconfigured into \"dozens of different cruise configurations\". A \"magnetic drive\", in turn, provides the thrust needed to get Falcon airborne. The emitter also possesses GPS jamming devices that prevent [[satellite]] tracking, while the hard-light wings interfere with infra-red tracking. A [[vibranium]] microweave was added to the costume itself, making Falcon resistant to small arms fire.<ref>Priest, Christopher ''Captain America and the Falcon'' #6, Marvel Comics (2004)</ref> The entire system is controlled mentally through cybernetic circuitry in the Falcon's mask. The costume has in the past featured a hidden \"talon\", a cybernetically controlled grappling line built into the gauntlets of his costume which he uses to entangle opponents, hook objects or for swinging and climbing when his wings are detached. The costume's visors come equipped with various capabilities, including infrared lenses, giving him the ability to see objects by their infrared signature at night, magnification capabilities, and remote imaging sensors that allow a full 360 degree of vision when activated. The cowl also has a wideband receiver and transmitter with an unspecified range. The suit was originally built by the Black Panther,<ref>''Captain America'' #170 (Feb. 1974). Marvel Comics</ref> with costume modifications by Desmond Burrell.{{Issue|date=June 2008}}\n\n==Other characters named Falcon==\n===Joaquin Torres===\nAs part of the 2015 [[All-New, All-Different Marvel]] branding, Captain America (Sam Wilson) investigated the disappearance of Mexican teenager Joaquin Torres after he was abducted by the [[Sons of the Serpent]].<ref name=\"Captain America: Sam Wilson #1\"/> Captain America discovered that Joaquin was being used in the experiments of [[Karl Malus]] who turned Joaquin into a bird/human hybrid using Captain America's pet bird Redwing. When Karl Malus was defeated, Captain America took Joaquin in.<ref name=\"Captain America: Sam Wilson #3\"/> When it was discovered Joaquin's bird/human hybrid condition wasn't temporary, Captain America learned from [[Claire Temple]] that Joaquin's condition was permanent due to Redwing being vampiric and sporting a healing factor.<ref name=\"Captain America: Sam Wilson #4\"/> When Captain America was captured by the Serpent Society and thrown out the window by [[Viper (Marvel Comics)|Viper]], he was saved by Joaquin.<ref name=\"Captain America: Sam Wilson #5\"/> Using his link with Redwing, Captain America telepathically sent Joaquin the knowledge on how to fight where he held his own until [[Misty Knight]] and [[Demolition Man (comics)|Demolition Man]] showed up.

This version appears to be an accomplished combatant, especially when using the sharp edge of the metal wings he wears as a weapon, which are controlled through the help of [[nanotechnology]], with which Wilson can communicate and retrieve computer information. The wings are partially self-repairing, as referenced in ''[[Ultimate Extinction]]''.<ref>''Ultimate Extinction'' #1\u20135. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n* In Marvel's [[MAX (comics)|MAX]] [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]] series ''[[War Machine|U.S. War Machine]]'', Wilson appeared alongside [[Captain America]] and [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Hawkeye]]; he and [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Hawkeye]] served as [[Captain America]]'s backup and wore no costumes, only being addressed by their real names. In this reality, [[Captain America]] was actually [[Bucky Barnes|Bucky]] wearing the Captain's uniform as here the Captain had died in [[World War II]] in his stead.\n* In a 2006 comic ''[[What If (comics)|What If Captain America had fought in the Civil War?]]'', the [[Earth-717]] version of Wilson was an orphan raised by a [[Shawnee]] [[medicine man]], and grew up to fight in the [[American Civil War]] as part of an Indian volunteer regiment. He performs a ritual to give Steven Rogers the power of We-Pi-Ahk, the Eagle Spirit, and has a red eagle painted on his chest for this ceremony. He is killed by [[Bucky Barnes|Colonel Barnes]] (who in this reality is the White Skull).\n* In the 1996 \"[[Heroes Reborn (1996 comic)|Heroes Reborn]]\" universe, created by [[Franklin Richards (Fantastic Four)|Franklin Richards]], a version of Samuel Wilson appears. His father, Abraham \"Abe\" Wilson fought alongside Captain America during [[World War II]], but was later killed by [[Master Man (Marvel Comics)|Master Man]]'s army.<ref>''Captain America'' vol. 2 #1</ref> During the fight, Abe's son Sam Wilson is shot in a fight and gravely wounded, but Captain America saves his life by giving him a transfusion of the Super-Soldier's own blood.

Eventually, she was recruited into Project Rebirth, and was chosen to undergo the procedure when the other candidates [[Bucky Barnes|Bucky]], [[Captain America|Steve Rogers]], and [[Isaiah Bradley]] were badly injured by Nazi agents. After this, she became Captain America, and fought the Nazis. When the Nazis attempted to summon creatures from another dimension, she entered said dimension to hold off the invading forces, un-aging in this reality for nearly 75 years. When she finally defeated them and returned to her home dimension of Earth-65, she was recruited by S.H.I.E.L.D. director Peggy Carter to continue her service as Captain America as one of her agents.<ref name=\"auto\">''Spider-Gwen'' vol. 2 #2.

After attending Stark's funeral, Wilson, with Barnes' approval, receives [[Captain America's shield (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Captain America's shield]] and mantle from an elderly Rogers.\n\n===Becoming Captain America===\n{{see also|The Falcon and the Winter Soldier}}\n{{further|New World Order (The Falcon and the Winter Soldier)|l1=New World Order}}\nIn 2024, Wilson has returned to work as a contractor with the USAF with support from his friend, USAF first lieutenant [[Joaquin Torres (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Joaquin Torres]]. In Washington, D.C., Wilson gives the shield to the U.S. government so it can be displayed in a [[Smithsonian]] exhibit dedicated to Captain America, believing that he is not worthy of taking up Captain America's mantle. He returns to Delacroix to help his sister, Sarah, with the family business until Torres tells of him an attack carried out by the [[Flag Smashers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Flag Smashers]], a terrorist group that believes life was better during the Blip. Wilson later learns that the U.S. government has named [[John Walker (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|John Walker]] the new Captain America.\n\n====Partnering with Bucky Barnes====\n{{further|The Star-Spangled Man|Power Broker (The Falcon and the Winter Soldier)|l2=Power Broker}}\nWilson is approached by Barnes, who expresses disapproval that the former surrendered the shield before joining him in facing the Flag Smashers and their leader [[Karli Morgenthau]] in [[Munich]], only to discover they all have superhuman strength. Despite receiving aid from Walker and [[Lemar Hoskins (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Lemar Hoskins]], Wilson and Barnes are overpowered and the terrorists escape. Walker requests the pair join him in aiding the Global Repatriation Council (GRC) to quash the ongoing violent post-Blip revolutions, but they decline and head to [[Baltimore]] to meet [[Isaiah Bradley (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Isaiah Bradley]], a [[Korean War]] veteran and super-soldier whom Barnes encountered in battle decades prior, to find out how the Flag Smashers obtained super-solder serum. However, Bradley refuses to help them, revealing he was imprisoned and experimented on by the government for thirty years. Barnes convinces Wilson to travel to [[Berlin]] and meet with the imprisoned Zemo in an effort to obtain information about the Flag Smashers, during which Barnes secretly orchestrates Zemo's escape. Despite his reluctance, Wilson joins Barnes and Zemo in traveling to [[Madripoor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Madripoor]] under assumed names to locate the source of the new super-soldier serum. They learn from high-ranking criminal, Selby, that the [[Sharon Carter (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Power Broker]] hired former Hydra scientist Dr. Wilfred Nagel to recreate the serum before the trio is compromised and Selby is killed. The trio are saved by the fugitive [[Sharon Carter (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Sharon Carter]], who agrees to help them after Wilson offers to get her pardoned. They travel to Nagel's lab and confront him, learning that he created twenty vials of the serum before the Flag Smashers stole them. After Zemo kills Nagel and bounty hunters destroy the latter's lab, Wilson, Barnes, and Carter fight the bounty hunters until Zemo acquires a getaway car to help them escape. While Carter stays behind, Wilson, Barnes, and Zemo travel to [[Latvia]] to find Morgenthau.\n\n====Stopping the Flag Smashers====\n{{further|The Whole World Is Watching (The Falcon and the Winter Soldier)|Truth (The Falcon and the Winter Soldier)|One World, One People|l1=The Whole World Is Watching|l2=Truth}}\nWilson attempts to persuade Morgenthau to end the violence, but an impatient unstable Walker interrupts and she escapes. After she threatens Sarah, Wilson meets with Morgenthau, during which she asks him to join her movement. Walker and Hoskins intervene, leading to a fight in which Morgenthau accidentally kills Hoskins. Enraged by his friend's death and having taken the serum, Walker uses Captain America's shield to kill one of the Flag Smashers in front of a group of horrified bystanders, who film his actions.\n\nFollowing this, Wilson and Barnes demand the shield from Walker, starting a fight in which Walker destroys Wilson's wingsuit before Wilson and Barnes narrowly take the shield back. After passing on his wingsuit to Torres, Wilson revisits Bradley, but the latter states his belief that a black man cannot, and should not, be Captain America. Wilson returns home to Louisiana and helps fix the family boat, with assistance from several locals as well as Barnes, who delivers a new Captain America suit he acquired from the Wakandans to Wilson. While training with the shield, Wilson and Barnes agree to move on from their pasts and work together as friends.\n\nAccepting his role as the new Captain America and after receiving a lead from Torres, Wilson flies to New York to save the GRC from the Flag Smashers with help from Barnes, Carter, and Walker. Wilson attempts to reason with Morgenthau, but Carter kills her when she points a gun at him. After carrying out Morgenthau's body, Wilson convinces the GRC to postpone their impending vote to force the relocation of Blip-displaced individuals and make efforts to help them instead. He also convinces the government to create a statue honoring Bradley as part of the Smithsonian's Captain America exhibit. Afterward, Wilson returns home and joins his family, Barnes, and his community for a cookout.\n\n== Alternate versions ==\n=== Zombie outbreak ===\n{{See also|What If...?
