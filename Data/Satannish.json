Satannish is known for granting mortals mystical power in exchange for their souls. He has been referred to as a creation and agent of [[Dormammu]], and the father of [[Daimon Hellstrom]] and [[Satana (Marvel Comics)|Satana]]<ref>''Hellcat'' #3</ref> (though the latter was later [[retcon]]ned{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}).\n\nHe has granted power to his cult, the [[Sons of Satannish]], and struck a pact with the human sorcerer Lord Nekron, first encountering [[Doctor Strange]] during this affair.<ref>''[[Doctor Strange (comic book)|Doctor Strange]]'' #175 (December 1968)</ref> Satannish made a bargain with the human sorcerer Asmodeus, and then encountered the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]].<ref>''The Defenders'' Annual #2</ref> Satannish also bargained with [[Baron Mordo]] during the \"Faust Gambit\" incident. He battled [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]] in New York City, and briefly merged with Mephisto as a result of Doctor Strange's spell, revealing that the two demons had once been part of the same demonic energies.<ref>''Doctor Strange'' vol. 3 #5-8</ref> Satannish was revealed to have hidden in the shadow of Mephista, daughter of Mephisto, in order to be taken into Mephisto's domain. There, he battled Mephisto, Mephista, and Doctor Strange, and was vanquished when Strange mystically connected Mephisto's and Satannish's life essences.<ref>''Doctor Strange'' vol. 3 #30</ref> Satannish also once empowered the [[Night Shift (comics)|Night Shift]].<ref>''Avengers West Coast'' #76-79 (November 1991-February 1992)</ref>\n\nDuring the ''[[Secret Invasion]]'' storyline, Satannish is one of many dark powers imprisoned within Avalon. He is freed, along with all the others, when [[Pete Wisdom]] releases Merlin.<ref name=\"CBMI3\">{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Paul Cornell]] | Penciller = [[Leonard Kirk]] | Inker = [[Jesse Delperdang]] | Story = The Guns Of Avalon | Title = Captain Britain and MI: 13 | Issue = #3 | Date = September 2008 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] | }}</ref> After hearing the invading [[Skrull]]s boast that they will subjugate all magical beings, Satannish and the others kill the Skrull forces invading Avalon.<ref name=\"CBMI4\">{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Paul Cornell]] | Penciller = [[Leonard Kirk]] | Inker = [[Jesse Delperdang]] | Story = The Guns Of Avalon | Title = Captain Britain and MI: 13 | Issue = #4 | Date = October 2008 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] | }}</ref>\n\nHe then offers Wisdom a boon, because the laws of magic insist that since Wisdom freed him, he must be repaid. Wisdom's request is \"No more Skrulls\" and Satannish honors this, using his powers to immediately kill every Skrull within Avalon and the United Kingdom. It is stated that Satannish's gift also means that any Skrull entering the United Kingdom immediately dies.<ref name=\"CBMI4\" />\n\nWhile in [[Otherplace|Limbo]], the recently resurrected [[Magik (Illyana Rasputin)|Illyana Rasputin]] attacks various other demons looking for her soulsword and the original bloodstone amulet. This does not go unnoticed by Satannish, [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]], [[Blackheart]], [[Dormammu]] and [[Hela (comics)|Hela]]. When Mephisto asks why they should concern themselves with a minor annoyance, Satannish reveals he is quite impressed by Illyana.<ref>''X-Infernus'' #1</ref>\n\nAlong with the other Lords of Hell, he passed judgement on [[Meggan (character)|Meggan]]; he was also amused to hear of the Duke of Hell, Doctor Plokta, being defeated.<ref>''Captain Britain and MI:13'' Annual #1</ref>\n\nDuring the ''[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]'' storyline, Satannish appeared at the Devil's Advocacy where they talked about the [[Serpent (comics)|Serpent]]'s threat on Earth.<ref>''Journey into Mystery'' #627</ref>\n\nIn the pages of ''[[Avengers Undercover]]'', Satannish appears as a member of the [[Shadow Council]]'s [[Masters of Evil]].<ref>''Avengers Undercover'' #2</ref> He is shown to have taken up residence in [[Bagalia]]'s Hell Town district.<ref>''Avengers Undercover'' #6</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nSatannish is a demonic being of pure mystical energy, an embodiment of evil. The guise he most often employs around human sorcerers is that of a green-skinned, horned being with a second face in his stomach. Satannish is more akin to a supernatural force of nature than a being; as such he possesses \"virtually unlimited\" mystic power which can be used for a variety of effects,<ref>''The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe: Master Edition''</ref> including (but not limited to) inter-dimensional teleportation, manipulation of time, space, and matter, size transformations, casting bolts of mystic energy as destructive force, demonic possession, and physical strength and durability. The character's extent of power has been shown as equal to that of Mephisto.<ref>''Doctor Strange: Sorcerer Supreme'' #6-8</ref> Satannish's ability to manifest in the dimension of Earth is, in some unknown way, limited by mystic factors and he frequently makes use of pawns native to Earth for his purposes. He also proved to be powerful enough to easily kill all the invading Skrulls who attempted to take Avalon's magic, which no other magical being in Avalon was able to do.<ref name=\"CBMI4\" />\n\n==In other media==\nSatannish appears in the ending of [[Morrigan Aensland]] in the video game ''[[Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds]]''. He is seen with Mephisto once again.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.marvel.com/universe/Satannish Satannish] at Marvel.com\n* {{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix5/satannish_demon.htm|Satannish}}\n\n{{Doctor Strange}}\n{{Defenders}}\n{{Marvel Mystic}}\n\n[[Category:Characters created by Gene Colan]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Roy Thomas]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1968]]\n[[Category:Fictional demons and devils]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics devils]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]"}]}}}}
