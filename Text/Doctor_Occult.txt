(August 1987) by E. Nelson Bridewell and Roy Thomas. They depicted him and his partner Rose Psychic being slated as human sacrifices at the hands of a demonic cult, but were rescued by a shadowy group called \"The Seven\". The two were later trained in the use of occult magics themselves. Thirty-six years later, Doctor Occult opened up his own detective agency, specializing in crimes of a mystical nature and during [[World War II]] he joined the All-Star Squadron. At some point, he and Rose become fused into one being. Doctor Occult has used sorcery to halt or greatly slow the aging process, so that he appears in modern comics to still be a man in his late thirties or early forties, even though he was born at the end of the 19th century.<ref name=\"dc-ency\"/><ref>{{cite web |title=Doctor Occult of Earth-Two appearances|url=http://www.mikesamazingworld.com/mikes/features/character.php?page=appearances&characterid=5 |website=www.mikesamazingworld.com |access-date=4 April 2019}}</ref>\n\nHe also appeared within the crossover storyline, ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]''.<ref name=\"CBR\"/>\n\nIn 1991, [[Neil Gaiman]] brought the character back into the spotlight with a prominent supporting role in ''[[The Books of Magic]]''.

Tim learns many important things from Dr. Occult, while nearly being trapped in the realm of the fae. This journey is meant to guide Timothy on the role to his becoming the most powerful magician of the current era. The other guides on this mission are [[Mister E]], the [[Phantom Stranger]], and [[John Constantine]], the last of whom sarcastically nicknames the group the [[Trenchcoat Brigade]]. The four would return later at a summons from Timothy, who, having lost everything at that point, needs a new direction in life.<ref name=\"vert-ency\">{{Cite book | last=Irvine | first=Alex | author-link=Alexander C.
