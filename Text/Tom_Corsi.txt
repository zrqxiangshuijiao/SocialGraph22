The [[Demon Bear]] carried out an attack on [[Danielle Moonstar|Dani Moonstar]]. After her attack, the [[New Mutants]] brought Dani to the Mid-County Medical Center. At the hospital, Tom and [[Sharon Friedlander]], an ER nurse, were kidnapped and possessed by the Demon Bear. The Demon Bear attempted to transform Corsi and Friedlander into his demonic slaves. After the New Mutants defeated the bear, Tom and Sharon were returned to their natural human form, though a couple of physical changes. The two of them\u2014who are both [[White American|Caucasian]]\u2014now physically resemble [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]], along with being enhanced to the level of perfect human specimens.<ref>''The New Mutants'' #17-18</ref>\n\n===Battle with the X-Mens' ennemies===\nLater, Tom and Sharon are mentally attacked by the New Mutants long-term adversary, [[Empath (comics)|Empath]]. The man twists the attraction the two have for each other into a sexual obsession, which lasts for several days.<ref>''The New Mutants'' #38</ref>\n\nAfterwards, Tom spent some time at the [[X-Mansion|Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters]]. Eventually, Tom found himself involved in a battle with the [[Reavers (comics)|Reavers]] on [[Muir Island]]. Tom was also one of the Muir Islanders being manipulated by the [[Shadow King]], at the time.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #251-255</ref>\n\n===Time at Our Mother of the Sacred Heart===\nBeing part of [[Professor X|Charles Xavier]]'s Mutant Underground, he was asked to work at 'Our Mother of the Sacred Heart', a school for the disabled. The school eventually came under attack by a group of [[Acolytes (comics)|Acolytes]] looking for a potential mutant. In the process, Tom kills one of the [[Kleinstocks (comics)|Kleinstock Brothers]]. Sharon is slain by [[Joanna Cargill]]. The X-Men, summoned by Sharon before her death, defeat the Acolytes.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #298</ref>\n\n===Teaching gym IS tough===\nSome time after, Tom was a gym teacher at the Massachusetts Academy, a school for mutants run by the White Queen. He teaches physical education to the mutants that reside there, a small group known as ''[[Generation X (comics)|Generation X]]''. When that facility is closed down, he moves back to the Xavier Institute. After many more students join Xaviers, Corsi again becomes a physical education teacher. The student called [[Elixir (comics)|Elixir]] is in his class.\n\nAfter M-Day, Corsi is let go due to the loss of 90% of the student body. Danielle Moonstar was also let go. His current whereabouts are unknown.\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nDue to the Demon Bear's enchantment of his body, Tom has moderately enhanced strength. He claims he can lift twice the amount of the world weight lifting record with relative ease.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Corsi, Tom}}\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1984]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Bill Sienkiewicz]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Chris Claremont]]\n[[Category:Fictional American police officers]]\n[[Category:Fictional schoolteachers]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters with superhuman strength]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics mutates]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics superheroes]]"}]}}}}
