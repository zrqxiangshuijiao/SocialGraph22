An encounter with the superheroine [[XS (comics)|XS]] (Jenni Ognats) of the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]] inspires Ultra-Man to form his own such team with fellow heroes Avatar, Behemoth, and Metallica on the planet Almeer-5.\n\nYears later, Gary Jr. would appear in [[Grant Morrison]]'s ''[[Multiversity]]'' series.  He is seen to currently inhabit an unnamed version of Earth, alongside other characters with variants of the word \"ultra\" in their names, including [[Ultra the Multi-Alien]] and [[Ultraa]].\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.toonopedia.com/ultraman.htm Gary Concord, The Ultra-Man] at [[Don Markstein's Toonopedia]].
