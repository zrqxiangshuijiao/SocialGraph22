The first, Clay Harder, was introduced in a 1948 comic from Marvel predecessor [[Timely Comics]]. The second, Matt Hawk a.k.a. Matthew J. Hawkins ([[retcon]]ned much later to Matt Liebowicz {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|l|i\u02d0|b|\u0259|w|\u026a|t|s}}), was introduced in 1962 and has continued into the 2010s. The latter Kid is better known, thanks primarily to his connection with, and later full integration into, Marvel Comics' shared continuity, known as the [[Marvel Universe]], but the Clay Harder Kid enjoyed a 14-year span in comics.\n\n==Publication history==\nThe series titled ''Two-Gun Kid'' ran in two parts, from 1948\u20131949 and then from 1953\u20131977. Clay Harder debuted in ''Two-Gun Kid'' #1 (March 1948).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Brevoort |first1=Tom |last2=DeFalco |first2=Tom |last3=Manning |first3=Matthew K. |last4=Sanderson |first4=Peter |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |title=Marvel Year By Year: A Visual History |date=2017 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1465455505 |page=39}}</ref><ref>[http://www.comics.org/series/577/ ''Two-Gun Kid'' (Marvel 1948 series)] at the [[Grand Comics Database]]</ref> He was Marvel's second continuing Western character, following the [[Masked Raider]], who had appeared in ''[[Marvel Mystery Comics|Marvel Comics]]'' #1 / ''Marvel Mystery Comics'' #2-12 (Oct. 1939 - Oct. 1940).<ref>[http://www.comics.org/character/name/masked%20raider/sort/chrono/ Masked Raider] at the Grand Comics Database</ref> ''Two-Gun Kid'' was the company's first ongoing Western title,<ref>Markstein, Don.

Beginning in 1953, Marvel continued the original ''Two-Gun Kid'' series from issue #11, publishing it through [[cover date]] April 1977. The Harder version appeared sporadically through 1962, with [[Joe Sinnott]] being the last artist to draw the original Two-Gun Kid on a regular basis.\n\n''Two-Gun Kid'' #60 (Nov. 1962) retconned the Clay Harder character out of existence, turning him into a [[dime novel]] character who had inspired the second Two-Gun Kid, Matt Hawk/Liebowicz. [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]], creators of the [[Fantastic Four]], concocted the new Kid to make the character resemble a superhero with a secret identity, in order to stimulate sales for the title.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}\n\nFrom issue #93 (July 1970) on, ''Two-Gun Kid'' was mostly a reprint title. At one point later in the second series, some of the original Kid's adventures were retouched to make him look like the newer Kid for reprints.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} Reprints, including many Jack Kirby-drawn stories, also appeared in the 1968-1976 title ''[[The Mighty Marvel Western]]''.\n\nA story in the 2000s{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} [[retcon]]ned that Matt's true last name is Liebowicz.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n===Clay Harder===\n{{expand section|date=July 2014}}\nClay Harder has bright blond hair and wears an all-black suit with a placard shirt, a broad-brimmed black hat. He packs two long-barreled revolvers with individual overlapping gun belts.\n\n===Matt Hawk/Liebowicz===\nMatt Hawk wears a similar outfit to Clay's, only with an orange-and-black spotted vest, a slightly narrower-brimmed hat, two revolvers on a single gun belt, and a black mask covering the top half of his face.\n\nIn the [[American frontier|Wild West]], Matt Hawk is a [[lawyer]] from [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], who is inspired to fight evil as a masked crime fighter of the 19th-century American West by the stories of the fictional Two-Gun Kid, Clay Harder. After being trained in combat by the gunfighter Ben Dancer, the character assumes the dual identities of Matt Hawk and the Two-Gun Kid. With his horse Thunder, his partner \"Boom Boom\" Brown, and a pair of pistols, he becomes one of the West's most prolific heroes, often teaming up with the [[Rawhide Kid]], [[Kid Colt]], or the [[Phantom Rider]]. In one of his first adventures, Matt fights an [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]], and in other early outings he fights criminals who can only be called [[supervillain]]s. During one adventure, he is brought to the present day via [[time travel]] and joins the [[superhero]] team of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].<ref>''[[The Avengers (comic book)|The Avengers]]'' #142\u2013144 (Dec. 1975\u2013Feb. 1976).</ref> He fights alongside them before leaving to wander America alongside his teammate [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Hawkeye]],<ref>''The Avengers'' #161\u2013162 (July\u2013Aug. 1977).</ref> and eventually returns to his own time,<ref>''The Avengers'' #172\u2013175 (June\u2013Sept. 1978).</ref> occasionally making a cameo appearance in other Western tales or stories of time travel.\n\nThe 1995 ''Two-Gun Kid: Sunset Riders'' [[miniseries]] reveals that Matt had married, only for his wife to die during childbirth; this series also reveals that the Kid had brought a cache of modern weapons back with him from the future. He was forced to stage his own death in order to free a man accused of murder, which got him embroiled in an international conspiracy for a hidden treasure.<ref>''Two-Gun Kid: Sunset Riders'' (1995).</ref> The later miniseries ''[[Blaze of Glory (comics)|Blaze of Glory]]'' (2000) depicts the Kid as retired from gunplay, going by the name of Clay Harder and working as a full-time lawyer. The Rawhide Kid convinces him to return to action, but the Two-Gun Kid dies in battle against the racist mercenary Nightriders, alongside his old partners Kid Colt and the [[Outlaw Kid]].<ref>''Blaze of Glory: The Last Ride of the Western Heroes'' #4 (Mar. 2000).</ref>\n\nLater, [[She-Hulk]],<ref>''[[She-Hulk]]'' vol. 2, #3 (Feb. 2006).</ref> after dealing with the [[Time Variance Authority]], is given the chance to free one time-traveling Avenger out of continuity limbo. She chooses the Two-Gun Kid. It's clarified that his heroic nature prevents him from being returned to his own time, as he would inevitably try to fix things.\n\nIn present time, he learns his previous modern-day encounters with the Avengers has resulted in his law license and other paraphernalia being kept in an Avengers safety-deposit box. Once he learns She-Hulk works for a law-firm, Goodman, Lieber, Kurtzberg & Holliway, he tries to become her colleague. He comes to the conclusion he will never be able to catch up on current laws and becomes a bounty hunter.<ref>''[[She-Hulk]]'' vol. 2, #5 (Apr. 2006).</ref> His first catch is the supervillain [[Bushwacker (comics)|Bushwacker]].\n\nFor a time he rooms with the [[Awesome Android]], who has reformed and is also an employee of the firm. Liebowicz travels using a twin-engine jet cycle, donated to him by his superhero friend [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Hawkeye]].\n\nDuring the company-crossover story arc ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'' (2006\u20132007), Liebowicz becomes a bounty hunter and works alongside She-Hulk, helping her to apprehend supervillains. He is later sent to [[Arizona]] to lead the [[Desert Stars]] team of the [[Fifty State Initiative]].<ref>[http://forum.newsarama.com/showpost.php?p=5572067&postcount=13 NEWSARAMA - View Single Post - Cup o' Joe May - 23<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In this capacity he is injured in ''Avengers: The Initiative'' #16 (2008), but is recovered by ''Avengers: The Initiative Special'' #1 (2009).\n\n====''The Marvels Project''====\nIn ''[[The Marvels Project]]'' the Two-Gun Kid is seen as an elderly patient of Dr. Thomas Halloway. He captivates Halloway with stories of a coming \"Age of Marvels,\" which detail the exploits of the Avengers and other modern-day Marvel heroes. Halloway believes Hawk/Liebowicz' stories are fantasies generated by his advanced age and senility.
