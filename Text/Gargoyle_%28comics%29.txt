Christians made a pact with the demon Avarrish to inhabit the body of a legendary gargoyle and act as an agent of the Six-Fingered Hand. The demons of the Six-Fingered Hand transferred Christians' life force into the Gargoyle body and sent him on a mission to capture [[Patsy Walker]], at that time operating as [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]] member Hellcat. Christians battled the Defenders, but rebelled against the Six-Fingered Hand. He was trapped in the gargoyle's body, but joined the Defenders.<ref>''The Defenders'' #94.

Christians, to prevent the chaos being wreaked by the gargoyle, re-assumed the body with the help of a druid and killed his original human body to prevent the demon from returning.<ref>''Gargoyle'' #1-4. Marvel Comics (New York).</ref>\n\n[[Moondragon]], under the influence of the [[Dragon of the Moon]], later separated Christians' life force from the gargoyle body. The body was to be used as a vessel for the Dragon of the Moon, and it became larger and more grotesque. The gargoyle body was carbonized and transformed into a statue of ash, when the Defenders defeated Moondragon and the Dragon of the Moon.<ref>''The Defenders'' #152. Marvel Comics (New York).</ref>\n\nChristians' life force came to reside in a crystal talisman. He reconciled with the spirit of Moondragon, and journeyed with [[Sundragon|Pamela Douglas]] to [[Titan (Marvel Comics location)|Titan]], where he witnessed the rebirth of Moondragon. The former Defender known as Cloud created a new body for Christians, with the ability to switch between his gargoyle and human forms at will.<ref>''Solo Avengers'' #16, 18, 20.

Both of them were approached by Iron Man for help in rescuing James Rhodes from [[Korvac]].<ref>''Iron Man'' vol. 6 #5. Marvel Comics (New York).</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nThe second Gargoyle is the result due to a magical transfer of Isaac Christians' spirit into an ancient gargoyle body. In this form, Gargoyle possesses supernatural strength and durability, as well as a thick leathery hide. He has the ability to manipulate \"biomystical\" energy for numerous effects, such as shapeshifting, concussive blasts, and fear inducement. He could siphon life-forces from other people, causing temporary debilitating weakness onto them. Surrounding himself in a biomystical field granted Gargoyle immunity to certain spells. Gargoyle is able to fly via levitation; his wings were incapable of producing sufficient lift, but useful for navigation. Christians can regenerate lost or damaged limbs, although they would differ wildly in appearance from the original limb. Overexpenditure of these energies in a short time might weaken or even kill him. Not only that, he could also be commanded to act against his will by an evil wizard who spoke a particular obscure spell. Isaac Christians was a student of the occult with minor mystical capabilities. Prior to his transformation, he had considerable knowledge of magic, including rudimentary spellcasting and summoning demons.<ref>''The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe'' Vol 2 #5 (April 1986)</ref>\n\n==In other media==\n===Television===\n* The Yuri Topolov version of Gargoyle appeared in the Hulk segment of ''[[The Marvel Super Heroes]]'', but he was called the Gorgon and not the Gargoyle in the TV version of the comic.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}\n* The Yuri Topolov version of Gargoyle appeared in the 1996 ''[[The Incredible Hulk (1996 TV series)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' series, voiced by [[Mark Hamill]]. Gargoyle is always trying to find a cure for his mutation even allying himself with [[Leader (comics)|Leader]]. In the episode \"Mortal Bounds\", he accidentally released a gamma virus (infecting amongst others [[Betty Ross]]) in his search for a cure where he was restored to a near normal state yet also infected. When Betty Ross was dying from the virus, Gargoyle gave Bruce Banner the antidote as Gargoyle is also cured. Before leaving, Gargoyle warns Banner that the next time they met he would not be so favorable. His position with Leader was one of grudging subservience, although he did become the dominant member when Leader temporarily lost his powers at the beginning of season two. From then on like [[MODOK]] in the ''[[Iron Man (TV series)|Iron Man]]'' animated series, he became the bumbling [[comic relief]] with a crush on [[She-Hulk]].\n\n===Video games===\nThe Yuri Topolov version of Gargoyle appears in ''[[Lego Marvel's Avengers]]''.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\n== Collected editions ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Title\n!Material collected\n!Published date\n!ISBN\n|-\n|''Defenders Epic Collection: The End of All Songs''\n|''Gargoyle'' #1-4 and ''Defenders'' #138-152\n|January 2020\n|{{ISBNT|978-1302920708}}\n|}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix9/gargoyle-topolov.html|Gargoyle (Yuri Topolov)}}\n* [https://www.writeups.org/gargoyle-hulk-topolov-marvel-comics/ Gargoyle (Yuri Topolov)] at Writeups.org\n* {{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix3/gargoylechristians.htm|Gargoyle (Isaac Christians)}}\n* [https://www.marvel.com/characters/gargoyle-isaac-christians/ Gargoyle (Isaac Christians)] at Marvel.com\n* [https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Isaac_Christians_(Earth-616) Gargoyle II] at Marvel Database\n* [http://www.marveldirectory.com/individuals/g/gargoyleii.htm Gargoyle (II)] at Marvel Directory\n* [https://comicvine.gamespot.com/gargoyle/4005-7114/ Gargoyle II] at Comic Vine\n\n{{Defenders}}\n{{Hulk}}\n{{Jack Kirby}}\n{{Stan Lee}}\n{{Initiative}}\n\n[[Category:Characters created by J.
