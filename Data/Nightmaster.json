He had slightly expanded guest roles in ''Primal Force'' #11\u201312 (Sept.-Oct. 1995) and ''[[Swamp Thing]]'' #160 and #164 (Nov. 1995 & March 1996). \n\nHe figured among many [[DC Comics]] [[supernatural]] heroes in the [[miniseries]]  ''[[Day of Vengeance]]'' #1\u20136 (June\u2013Nov. 2005), primarily starring the [[Spectre (comics)|Spectre]], in ''Day of Vengeance: [[Infinite Crisis]] Special'' #1 (March 2006), and in most issues of the seven-issue miniseries ''Infinite Crisis'' (Dec. 2005 \u2013 June 2006) before becoming one of the stars of the namesake team in the ongoing series ''[[Shadowpact]]'', which premiered with a first issue cover-dated July 2006.<ref>[http://www.comics.org/search.lasso?type=character&query=nightmaster&sort=chrono&Submit=Search Nightmaster] at [[Grand Comics Database]]</ref>\n\n== Fictional character biography ==\n'''Jim Rook''', lead singer of the hard rock band \"the Electrics\", enters a run-down shop named Oblivion Inc. Inside, he is somehow transported to the strange dimension Myrra, where he is the descendant of the mighty Myrran warrior Nacht.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cowsill |first1=Alan |last2=Irvine |first2=Alex |last3=Manning |first3=Matthew K. |last4=McAvennie |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |title=DC Comics Year By Year: A Visual Chronicle |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-8578-6 |page=126}}</ref> He takes his ancestor's Sword of Night, a weapon with the ability to warn of danger and force a person to speak the truth, and becomes involved in a clash between Myrra and evil warlocks. After his adventures in Myrra, he opens a bookstore in the Oblivion Inc. space and becomes active with other metahuman and supernatural entities, such as [[Primal Force]] and [[Swamp Thing]].\n\nWhile exploring a mysterious door in his bookstore, Rook discovers it was actually one of the many \"back rooms\" of the [[Oblivion Bar]], an otherdimensional realm open to those touched by magic. After serving for a time as the bar's relief bartender, he becomes its owner. The bar has the benefits of modern life, such as showers, dishwashers and microwaves. It also has its own special rules, such as the phones not working unless the caller knows his or her dimension's area code.<ref>[http://www.dcuguide.com/who.php?name=nightmaster The Unofficial Guide to the DC Universe: Nightmaster]</ref>\n\n===Shadowpact===<!--Note: per WPC MOS, FCB is written in-universe-->\nThe bar becomes very crowded after the [[Spectre (DC Comics)|Spectre]], the wrath of God, destroys all magic, believing that this would cause the end of all evil. [[Detective Chimp]], a longtime resident of the bar, rallies people to fight the Spectre. Rook and several other heroes lead the charge, ultimately forming the unofficial team [[Shadowpact]]. By themselves and with allies, Shadowpact battles to stop the Spectre and his own ally, [[Eclipso]].\n\nAfter the Spectre's defeat, Rook and his friends are recruited by the [[Phantom Stranger]] to enter the town of Riverrock, [[Wyoming]]. While trapped inside and saving the townspeople from being sacrificed by the villainous group Pentacle, they perceive that about a day has passed, though due to the effects of magic, a year has actually passed outside. Back home, Rook discovers not only that he and his allies are memorialized in a statue, and the group thought to be dead, but that he has lost his bar to an unwelcome newcomer whom Rook cannot dislodge.<ref>''Shadowpact'' #1\u20135 (July\u2013November 2006)</ref>\n\nRook learns that the longer he is in possession of the sword, the less he ages, and later that his sword is inhabited by the last wielder, his father.<ref>''Shadowpact'' #12 (June 2007)</ref>\n\nWhen Nightmaster, Nightshade and Ragman attempt to teleport to [[Washington, D.C.]], to break up a bank robbery, they become trapped mid-transit in the Land of Nightshades. The duo learn that Myrra, and its capital city, Arcady, are related to and likely a part of that land. Later, Rook leaves the Shadowpact in order to return to Myrra.<ref>''Shadowpact'' #22 (April 2008)</ref>\n\n===DC Rebirth=== \nRook, along with Detective Chimp, is still seen as the proprietor of the Oblivion Bar during the ''[[Dark Nights: Metal]]'' event, when assembled heroes take refuge from the incoming threat of Barbatos. He stays behind to defend the bar as the Dark Knights invade, and is subsequently killed with the Sword of Night by the Batman Who Laughs.<ref>''Dark Nights: Metal'' #3 (October 2017)</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.fanzing.com/mag/fanzingzero/hoj.shtml Fanzing.com: Nightmaster]\n*[http://darkmark6.tripod.com/shortrun.html The Earth-One Index: Short-Run Heroes]\n\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1969]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Dennis O'Neil]]\n[[Category:DC Comics superheroes]]\n[[Category:DC Comics fantasy characters]]\n[[Category:DC Comics characters who use magic]]\n[[Category:Fantasy comics]]\n[[Category:Fictional swordfighters in comics]]\n[[Category:Fictional singers]]"}]}}}}
