From this point, the character was featured as a guest in a variety of titles, returning to regular publication in 1981 with a redesigned costume in issue #377 of the ''[[The Mighty World of Marvel|Marvel Superheroes]]'' anthology title, initially written by [[Dave Thorpe]] and illustrated by [[Alan Davis]]. After ''Marvel Superheroes'' #388 (August 1982), the series moved into a new monthly comic, ''[[The Daredevils]]'', written by [[Alan Moore]], who introduced the concept of the Captain Britain Corps and the broader Marvel Multiverse. When ''The Daredevils'' was canceled after eleven issues, Captain Britain stories were featured in to ''The Mighty World of Marvel'' (vol. 2), later moving to the new series ''Captain Britain Monthly''. The character was infrequently featured in American Marvel comics as well.\n\nFollowing the cancellation of Captain Britain's solo series, Claremont and Davis created the one-shot special ''Excalibur: The Sword is Drawn'' (December 1987), which served to launch the American monthly ''[[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]]'' in 1988, featuring an eponymous team which included Captain Britain. Marvel UK incorporated Captain Britain as the main attraction of their own group series, ''[[Knights of Pendragon]]'', which initially met with positive critical response and strong sales, but declined to the point of cancellation with issue #18.<ref name=\"back29\"/> ''Excalibur'' volume 1 ended with issue #125 in 1998.

The characters are all known as, or appear as an alternative version of, Captain Britain, each coming from an [[Marvel Comics Multiverse|alternative reality]]. Created by writer Alan Moore and artist Alan Davis, the corps first appeared in ''The Daredevils'' #6 (June 1983). Founded by [[Merlyn (Marvel Comics)|Merlyn]], his daughter [[Roma (comics)|Roma]] and Sir James Braddock, the organization is tasked with defending the multiverse, with each member protecting their own reality from their respective dimensional equivalent the British Isles, and was powered by the friction between dimensions. In addition to the Captains themselves, the organization has included administrators such as Merlyn, Roma, and Saturnyne.\n\n===History===\nMerlyn and Roma had arranged for each chosen member of the Corps to gain superpowers, often using unscrupulous means. The first published gathering of the Corps in their entirety occurred at Merlyn's funeral.<ref>''The Mighty World of Marvel'' (vol. 2) #13</ref> Following Merlyn's funeral, Roma took control over the corps, making Saturnyne her subordinate and bringing Corps members to the Starlight Citadel for training. Roma also tasked Corps members to take turns in defending Otherworld.{{Issue|date=April 2009}} Corps members would continue to gather in various stories, such as the wedding of [[Meggan (character)|Meggan]] and Braddock,<ref name=\":0\" /> the conclusion of the Cross-Time Caper){{Issue|date=April 2009}}, and their assignment as the jury in Braddock's trial for breaching the Corps Code of Conduct.{{Issue|date=April 2009}} The corps rarely fought as a unit in these stories, with an exception occurring when Roma dispatched them against [[Franklin Richards (Fantastic Four)|Franklin Richards]] and the [[Fantastic Four]], though it is suggested that this attack was a ruse to let [[Alysande Stuart|Caledonia]], a former prisoner of Roma's starlight citadel, infiltrate the Fantastic Four's home as Franklin's nanny to prepare them for their forthcoming battle with [[Abraxas (comics)|Abraxas]].{{Issue|date=April 2009}}\n\nThe Corps was nearly wiped out by Mastermind, a villainous computer belonging to Brian Braddock, and a group of mutated children known as the [[Jaspers' Warp#Warpies|Warpies]] (victims of the [[Jaspers' Warp]]), who were once the wards of Captain UK. Roma stepped down as omniversal guardian, giving the title to Brian Braddock, who became King of Otherworld and rebuilt the Corps. Another wave of destruction tore through Otherworld due to [[Scarlet Witch|Wanda Maximoff]]'s alterations to reality in ''[[House of M]]'', which nearly led to Roma and Saturnyne erasing that universe, however due to Meggan's sacrifice, the heroes are able to seal the tear.<ref name=tuxm1>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #462-465. Marvel Comics.</ref> The corps rebuilt its ranks but once again it came under attack, this time from Mad Jim Jaspers and corps members which he began to turn into [[Fury (Marvel Comics)|Fury]]s.{{Issue|date=April 2009}} The end of the battle saw Roma dead and most of the corps along with her. [[Saturnyne]] appointed Albion leader and told Captain Britain to stay and keep an eye on his reality as they rebuilt the corps once again.<ref name=dbts5>''[[X-Men: Die by the Sword]]'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref> During the events of \"Time Runs Out\", the Captain Britain Corps investigate universal Incursions which are causing the destruction of various realities, and the deaths of twenty Corpsmen. After the members of the Corps capture a Mapmaker, the [[Beyonders|Ivory Kings]] send their entire forces to overrun the Starlight Citadel, destroying the entire Corps. Saturnyne is able to teleport Brian Braddock to safety, leaving him as the Corps' only survivor.<ref>''New Avengers'' (vol. 3) #30. Marvel Comics.</ref> Following the reestablishment of the Multiverse, Brian is still the only member of the Captain Britain Corps alive. \n\nWhen the mutant nation of Krakoa came into conflict with Otherworld, Brian was corrupted by Morgana Le Fey and his sister Braddock claimed the title of Captain Britain. After their brother Jamie took Otherworld's throne as king, he used his omega-level mutant abilities to break and rebuild reality by using Earth-616 as the foundation, changing several details and allowing the new reality to \"backfill\" justifications its existence. After fracturing reality once again by killing Betsy, Jamie restores the numbers of the Incursion crisis, which historically, were made up of Braddock family members across the Omniverse (usually variants of Brian), however this new reality chooses to use Betsy's compatriots in the new iteration of Excalibur (Gambit, Jubilee, Rictor and Rogue) as templates for new Captains Britain, each of which is given a version of the Amulet of Right.{{fact|date=August 2022}} During ''[[X of Swords]]'', in which Betsy Braddock wielded the Starlight Sword, a blade forged from the nexus of reality itself, Braddock was seemingly killed in battle by Isca the Unbeaten, shattering the sword and Braddock herself; Saturnyne used the broken pieces to reconstitute the corps.<ref name=\"XOSD\">''X of Swords: Destruction'' (November 2020)</ref>\n\n===Membership===\nThe Captain Britain Corps spans the multiverse; the exact number of members, most of whom are unnamed, is unclear. While many members are simply named Captain Britain, others use names which take an alternate approach to referencing their role as champion of the British isles (such as Captain U.K. or Lady London), while others' names may be reflective of the specific characteristics of their respective universes (such as Hauptmann Englande or The Violet Swan) or individual circumstances (such as Spider-UK). Of the corps members depicted in publication, most, but not all, have been [[Brian_Braddock#Other_versions|alternate versions of Brian]] or [[Betsy_Braddock#Other_versions|Betsy Braddock]]. Although members usually refer to the organization simply as \"The Corps\" or \"The Captain Britain Corps,\" others have attached their own names, such as Crusader X referring to them as \"The Crusader X Corps.\"\n\n====Current members====\nThese individuals are known in-story to be current members of the Corps as of the conclusion of ''X of Swords''.<ref name=\"XOSD\" />\n<!--Please fill in as information becomes available, preferably with references-->\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=100%\n!width=20%| Title (real name)\n!width=10%| Universe of origin\n!width=20%| First appearance as member of corps\n!width=45%| Additional notes\n|-\n| Captain Britain (Beth Braddock)\n| Earth-6\n|\n|\n|-\n| Justicar Druidica\n| Earth-14\n|\n|\n|-\n| Captain Britain (Elizander Braddock)\n| Earth-15\n|\n| \n|-\n| Captain Amphibian\n| Earth-22\n|\n|\n|-\n| Alpha Briton\n| Earth-33\n|\n|\n|-\n| Sister Britain\n| Earth-65\n|\n|\n|-\n| Captain Krakoica\n| Earth-78\n|\n|\n|-\n| The Green Woman\n| Earth-99\n|\n|\n|-\n| Captain Angland\n| Earth-305\n|\n|\n|-\n| Captain Albion\n| Earth-523\n|\n|\n|-\n| [[Betsy Braddock|Captain Britain (Betsy Braddock)]]\n| Earth-616\n| ''Captain Britain'' (vol. 2) #13 (temporary); ''Excalibur'' (vol. 4) #1 (permanent)\n|\n|-\n| Captain Britain (Liz Braddock)\n| Earth-812\n|\n|\n|-\n| Captain UK\n| Earth-839\n|\n|\n|-\n| Captain Bretland\n| Earth-904\n|\n|\n|-\n| Captain Granbretan\n| Earth-1812\n|\n|\n|-\n| Captain Plumdragon\n| Earth-2112\n|\n|\n|-\n| High Priestess Celtia\n| Earth-2113\n|\n|\n|-\n| Crusader X (Bran Braddock)\n| Earth-2122\n|\n|\n|-\n| Centurion Britannia\n| Earth-4100\n|\n|\n|-\n| Captain Baboon\n| Earth-8101\n|\n|\n|-\n| The Violet Swan\n| Earth-8311\n|\n|\n|-\n| Elspeth Braddock\n| Earth-13059\n|\n|\n|-\n| Britannica Rex\n| Earth-99476\n|\n|\n|-\n|}\n\n====Former members====\nThese individuals are known in-story to have left the Corps or died.\n<!--Please fill in as information becomes available, preferably with references-->\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=100%\n!width=20%| Title (real name)\n!width=10%| Universe of origin\n!width=20%| First appearance as member of corps\n!width=45%| Additional notes\n|-\n|Brother Brit-Man (Gilles Weill)\n|Earth-65\n|''Excalibur'' #44\n|Killed by a [[Fury (Marvel Comics)|Fury]].<ref name=dbts3/>\n|-\n|Yeoman U.K. (Brion Burdack)<ref name=\"OHOTMUv2\"/>\n|Earth-148 (''Ee'rath'')\n|''Excalibur'' #1\n|He was a member of an [[Excalibur (comics)#Excalibur (Earth-148)|alternative Excalibur]].
