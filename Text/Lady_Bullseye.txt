A female counterpart of [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]], she was created by [[Ed Brubaker]], [[Marko Djurdjevic]], and [[Clay Mann]], first appearing in ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]'' #111. She has primarily been an opponent of the superhero [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]].\n\nOriginally inspired to become a trained assassin when she witnessed [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]] easily kill a number of people, she would later become a member of the [[The Hand (comics)|Hand]], although she did not hold their traditions in high esteem. Her alter ego is a lawyer, opposing Matt Murdock in the courtroom, thereby attacking Daredevil on two fronts. Lady Bullseye's true intentions were to take control of the Hand clan, but instead Daredevil becomes their leader.\n\n[[Reiko Aylesworth]] voiced the Maki Matsumoto incarnation of Lady Bullseye in the [[Hulu]] [[streaming television]] series ''[[Hit-Monkey (TV series)|Hit-Monkey]]'', while [[Olivia Munn]] voiced '''Akiko Yokohama''', a new incarnation and the self-declared nemesis of [[Hit-Monkey]].\n\n==Publication history==\nLady Bullseye was inspired by [[Lady Snowblood (manga)|Lady Snowblood]], a Japanese [[femme fatale]].<ref name=\"enterladybullseye\">{{cite web|url=http://www.marvel.com/news/comicstories.4804.Daredevil~colon~_Enter_Lady_Bullseye|title=Daredevil: Enter Lady Bullseye|last=Phegley|first=Kiel|date=2008-09-05 |publisher=Marvel.com|access-date=2009-05-02}}</ref>\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nBorn in [[Japan]], the young girl (it has not been revealed whether Maki Matsumoto is her birth name or an assumed one) who would become Lady Bullseye was imprisoned by the [[Yakuza]], who planned to sell her and many others into sexual slavery. However, [[Bullseye (character)|Bullseye]], on an unrelated errand, arrived to slaughter the mobsters. The sight of Bullseye effortlessly killing her captors inspired the girl to escape and become a killer.<ref>''Daredevil'' vol. 2 #111.

However, she has demonstrated little tolerance for The Hand's ritual, interrupting some (who are used to those traditions) off-guard in order to kill her enemies. She kills and resurrects both [[White Tiger (Angela del Toro)|White Tiger]] and [[Black Tarantula]] to assist her.<ref>''Daredevil'' vol. 2 #112\u2013114.

When one of her associates discovers this, she kills him to prevent the Hand from learning the truth. Hiroshi claims that all she has done has been according to his will. Lady Bullseye offers Daredevil the leadership of the Hand, which he refuses. The organization regroups to [[Spain]], preparing to initiate \"Plan B\". There, she finds [[Kingpin (character)|Kingpin]], trying to live a normal civilian life, and kills his new girlfriend and her kids, and brutally stabbing Kingpin, telling him that this is a message for Matt Murdock.<ref>''Daredevil'' vol. 2 #114\u2013116. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nIt turns out that Matsumoto's real goal was to take the leadership of the Hand herself, something she had been promised by Daredevil's ally [[Master Izo]], who was revealed to have trained her. However, Izo was lying, and instead intended for Daredevil himself to take that post and reform the Hand. This occurring, Daredevil had Lady Bullseye cast out of the Hand for being untrustworthy. Angry, she vowed to kill Izo.<ref>''Daredevil'' #500.

Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nLady Bullseye has no apparent superhuman powers, but is a master of several martial arts and a proficient hand-to-hand combatant, and specializes in using [[katana]] and [[shuriken]]. It has been noted{{by whom|date=March 2022}} that she is faster than Bullseye and less powerful than the Kingpin. Regardless, she has defeated Daredevil and [[Black Widow (Marvel Comics)|Black Widow]] on separate occasions, and nearly defeated Daredevil on another occasion. Daredevil has commented that in her costumed form she has little scent and a very level pulse, akin to one performing [[yoga]]. She is also skilled in legal matters, being a lawyer in her civilian guise.<ref>''Daredevil'' vol. 2 #113. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n==In other media==\n[[Reiko Aylesworth]] voiced the Maki Matsumoto incarnation of Lady Bullseye in the [[Hulu]] [[animated series]] ''[[Hit-Monkey (TV series)|Hit-Monkey]]'' while [[Olivia Munn]] voiced Akiko Yokohama, the new Lady Bullseye and self-declared nemesis of [[Hit-Monkey]]. In the series, Lady Bullseye is initially hired by [[Bonsai Master]] on behalf of Shinji Yokohama to kill Hit-Monkey after he decimates the [[yakuza]] seeking vengeance for his tribe's slaughter, aided by the ghost Bryce Fowler, a former [[Assassination|assassin]] associate of hers. Initially dismissive of having to kill a \"circus animal\", Lady Bullseye develops a personal vendetta against Hit-Monkey after he is able to cut her cheek. Upon learning of Bryce's presence as a ghost, Lady Bullseye uses salt in an attempt to hurt him, only for him to acquire temporary corporeality, which he uses to restrain her long enough for police officer Haruka to shoot her. After Hit-Monkey kills Yokohama after he steals Haruka's gun, intending to shoot her, Yokohama's niece and Hit-Monkey's former friend Akiko swears vengeance upon him, taking Lady Bullseye's mask from her body and putting in on, taking the mantle for herself.<ref>{{Cite web |author=Marvel |date=September 20, 2021 |title='Hit-Monkey' Premieres November 17 On Hulu |url=https://www.marvel.com/articles/tv-shows/hit-monkey-premieres-november-17-hulu  |access-date=September 20, 2021 |website=[[Marvel.com]]}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Portal|Speculative fiction|Comics}}\n* {{cite web| url= http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=158787| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20081207055820/http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=158787 |archive-date= December 7, 2008| first= Ed| last= Brubaker| author-link= Ed Brubaker| title= Ed Brubaker on Lady Bullseye| work= Newsarama.com| publisher= Matt Brady| interviewer= Newsarama | date= May 31, 2008| access-date= September 1, 2020}}\n* {{Marveldatabase|Maki Matsumoto (Earth-616)|Lady Bullseye}}\n*[http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix8/lady_bullseyedd.htm Her profile in the Appendix to the Marvel Handbook]\n\n{{Daredevil}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bullseye, Lady}}\n[[Category:Characters created by Ed Brubaker]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 2008]]\n[[Category:Fictional assassins in comics]]\n[[Category:Fictional female assassins]]\n[[Category:Fictional lawyers]]\n[[Category:Fictional murderers]]\n[[Category:Fictional female ninja]]\n[[Category:Fictional Japanese people]]\n[[Category:Fictional women soldiers and warriors]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics female supervillains]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics martial artists]]"}]}}}}
