In accordance with their mission as creations of the Builders, Aleph taught them to transform into perfect creatures any species they encountered.<ref name=\"Avengers #2\">''Avengers'' vol. 5 #2</ref> Ex Nihilo, Abyss, and their Aleph arrived on [[Mars]] where they terraformed it to contain a breathable atmosphere and vegetation. After Ex Nihilo shot an Origin Bomb at [[Earth]] to accelerate the evolution of mankind, which affected almost two million people, the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] scrambled a response team. Not interested in fighting, Ex Nihilo tried to accelerate [[Iron Man]]'s evolution so that he no longer needed an exoskeleton. When [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]] and [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Hawkeye]] retaliated, Ex Nihilo became angry and attacked them. During the brawl, Ex Nihilo, Abyss, and the Aleph defeated the Avengers and imprisoned them. A helpless [[Captain America]] was sent back to Earth as a message.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Jonathan Hickman|Hickman, Jonathan]]|artist= [[Jerome Ope\u00f1a|Ope\u00f1a, Jerome]]|story= Avengers World|title= The Avengers|volume= 5|issue= #1|date= February 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite comic| writer= Hickman, Jonathan|artist= Ope\u00f1a, Jerome|story= We Were Avengers|title=Avengers|volume= 5|issue= #2|date= February 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite comic| writer= Hickman, Jonathan|artist= Ope\u00f1a, Jerome|story= The Garden|title=Avengers|volume= 5|issue= #3|date= March 2013}}</ref> Awakening three days later, Captain America implemented the Avengers initiative called \"Wake The World\" which initiated the team's most massive assemblage to date. Ex Nihilo's intervention started being \"world-razing\" for the Aleph which would force him to destroy the Earth if Ex Nihilo failed to polish this planet.<ref name=\"Avengers #2\"/> Captain America and those that are part of the \"Wake the World\" initiative arrived as soon as Ex Nihilo's first human was fully developed. He and his allies fought the Avengers until they noticed the presence of the latest [[Captain Universe]]. Ex Nihilo and his allies recognized her as a power beyond them they must obey. Captain Universe ordered Ex Nihilo and Abyss to stop their crossing to transform and/or destroy \"imperfect\" worlds. However, the Aleph resisted and was finally destroyed by the heroine. Before returning to Earth, the Avengers established that Ex Nihilo could reform Mars as he pleased as long as he did not interfere with Earth.<ref name=\"Avengers Vol. 5 #3\">''Avengers'' vol. 5 #3</ref>\n\nEx Nihilo creates [[Nightmask]], an artificial human, on the [[terraforming|terraformed]] surface of the planet Mars.<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 5 #1</ref> After a fierce battle with the Avengers, Nightmask is taken to Earth and given residence in [[Stark Tower|Avengers Tower]].<ref name=\"Avengers Vol. 5 #3\"/>\n\nNightmask and [[Star Brand]] later head to Mars to confront Ex Nihilo.<ref>''Avengers'' vol 5 #8</ref>\n\n[[Omega Flight]] is sent in by Department H to investigate one of the Origin Bomb sites left by Ex Nihilo in Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada.

They were offered by [[Sunspot (comics)|Sunspot]] a one-way trip to help his branch of the Avengers investigate the origin of this decay by using [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]] technology and travel across the Multiverse.<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 5 #36</ref> Sunspot's Avengers branch traveled across numerous universes navigating the map left by the Mapmakers. After one last jump across universes that cost Nightmask's life, Sunspot's Avengers branch found themselves face to face with a fissure in time and space. From it, two [[Beyonders]] emerged and demanded the heroes to fall back. Upon denying their request, Sunspot's Avengers faced the Beyonders. In an attempt to reprogram one of the Beyonders, Ex Nihilo, Abyss, and rest of the Gardeners sacrificed themselves.<ref>''New Avengers'' vol. 3 #32</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nEx Nihilo has the power to create new life and modify existing life forms on a planetary scale like control the movement and growth of the plants and transform organic life.
