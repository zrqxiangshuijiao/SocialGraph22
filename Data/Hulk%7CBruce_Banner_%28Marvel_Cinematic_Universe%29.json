Banner is depicted as a [[genius]] [[physicist]] who after a failed experiment to replicate a [[Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|super soldier]] program using [[gamma radiation]], transforms into a large, muscular creature with green skin whenever his [[heart rate]] goes above 200 beats per minute or when facing mortal danger. As the Hulk, he possesses [[superhuman]] abilities including increased strength and durability. Over time, Banner demonstrates an increasing ability to control the transformation, and he becomes a founding member of the [[Avengers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Avengers]]. Following the conflict with [[Ultron (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Ultron]], Banner is unintentionally transported to [[Sakaar (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Sakaar]], where he remains the Hulk for a number of years until eventually returning to Earth to participate in the battle against [[Thanos (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thanos]]. In the years after Thanos [[The Blip|erases half of all life]], Banner learns to retain the Hulk form with his mind still intact, and he is instrumental in the Avengers' mission to use [[time travel]] to obtain the [[Infinity Stones]] from the past. After the Avengers succeed, Banner himself restores trillions of lives across the universe using the Stones in a specially made [[Features of the Marvel Cinematic Universe#Nano Gauntlet|gauntlet]]. After his [[metafiction]]al cousin [[Jennifer Walters (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Jennifer \"Jen\" Walters]] is accidentally imbued with his blood, becoming a \"She-Hulk\", Banner trains her to handle her transformations before departing again to Sakaar, returning months later with his son (born during his time there): [[Skaar (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Skaar]].\n\n{{As of|2022}}, Banner has appeared in nine films after being introduced in the titular film ''[[The Incredible Hulk (film)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' (2008). The character has been generally well-received by critics and audiences alike, but Norton's recasting and the inconsistent characterization of the character in latter films have some criticism. Ruffalo reprised the role in the television series ''[[She-Hulk: Attorney at Law]]'' (2022).\n\nRuffalo voices several [[#Alternate versions|alternate versions]] of Banner in the animated series ''[[What If...?

Do I think Hulk can carry a movie and be as entertaining as he was in ''Avengers''? I do believe that. I do believe he absolutely could. We certainly are not even going to attempt that until ''Avengers 2''. So there's a lot of time to think about it\".<ref name=\"Sep2012Sequel\" />\n\nIn June 2014, Ruffalo said he believed the studio might be considering doing a new standalone Hulk film, saying, \"I think they are, for the first time, entertaining the idea of it.

But there's still nothing definitive, not even a skeletal version of what it would be\".<ref name=\"RuffaloSequelJune2014\" /> In July, Feige stated that the studio was not considering a \"Planet Hulk\" film at that time, due to wanting to feature Ruffalo's Banner in the film. However, he did not rule out a story that saw the Hulk and Banner end up in space and explained why a solo Hulk film did not occur in [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films#Phase Two|Phase Two]] of the MCU by saying, \"After the first ''Avengers'', Iron Man had his own movie, Thor had his own movie, Captain America had his own movie, and Widow and Fury were in ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier|The Winter Soldier]]''. So it was really about, frankly, ''saving'' somebody so that the only place you could get Hulk between ''Avengers'' movies is the ''next'' ''Avengers'' movie, so [director Joss Whedon] could continue to play with that in [''Avengers: Age of Ultron'']. Where we go after that, we'll see\".<ref name=\"FeigeIGNJuly2014\" />\n\nIn April 2015, Ruffalo noted that Universal holding the distribution rights to Hulk films may be an obstacle to releasing a future Hulk standalone film<ref name=\"RuffaloApril2015\" /> and reiterated this in October 2015,<ref name=\"RuffaloUSAToday\" /> and July 2017.<ref name=\"RuffaloJuly2017\" /> According to ''The Hollywood Reporter'', a potential reason why Marvel has not reacquired the film distribution rights to the Hulk as they did with [[Paramount Pictures]] for the Iron Man, Thor, and Captain America films is that Universal holds the [[Universal Parks & Resorts|theme park]] rights to several Marvel characters that Marvel's parent company, [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]], wants for its own [[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts|theme parks]].<ref name=\"THRJulyl2015\" /> In December 2015, Ruffalo stated that the strained relationship between Marvel and Universal may be another obstacle to releasing a future standalone Hulk film.<ref name=\"RuffaloYahooDec2015\" /> The following month, he indicated that the lack of a standalone Hulk film allowed the character to play a more prominent role in ''[[Thor: Ragnarok]]'', ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'', and ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'', stating, \"We've worked a really interesting arc into ''Thor[: Ragnarok]'', ''Avengers[: Infinity War]'', and [''Avengers: Endgame''] for Banner that I think will\u2014when it\u2019s all added up\u2014will feel like a Hulk movie, a standalone movie\".<ref name=\"RuffaloYahooJan2016\" />\n\nCharles Pulliam-Moore, writing for ''[[Gizmodo]]'', said of the earlier MCU films that \"[w]hile there are a number of storylines from Marvel's comics that delve deeper into the duality of Banner/Hulk's identity... Marvel's movies have forgone those plot lines in favor of trotting Bruce out to babble about science and break things when necessary\".<ref name=\"Gizmodo\" /> One specific difference from the comic books is Banner's involvement in the creation of [[Ultron (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Ultron]] and the [[Vision (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Vision]], a character who in the comics was created solely by Ultron. The Vision, in the films, is created as a counter to Ultron, who had previously been created by Stark and Bruce Banner. In the comics, however, Ultron is created by a different member of the Avengers, Hank Pym.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://screenrant.com/iron-man-worst-changes-from-the-comic-books-to-movies/ |title=Iron Man: 15 Worst Changes From The Comic Books To The Movies |first=Ben |last=Browne |publisher=[[Screen Rant]] |date=January 18, 2017 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180114020316/https://screenrant.com/iron-man-worst-changes-from-the-comic-books-to-movies/ |archive-date=January 14, 2018 }}</ref>\n\nDue to the lack of freestanding films about the Hulk, the character has been depicted in very few of the storylines shown in the comic books.

While working at Culver University, [[Virginia]], Banner meets with General [[Thaddeus Ross (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thaddeus Ross]], the father of his colleague and girlfriend [[Betty Ross (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Betty]], regarding an experiment that Ross claims is meant to make humans immune to gamma radiation, a field in which Banner is an expert. The experiment \u2014 part of the World War II-era supersoldier program that Ross hopes to recreate \u2014 fails, and the exposure to the gamma radiation causes Banner to transform into the Hulk for the first time. The Hulk goes on a rampage, destroying the lab, killing three people and injuring several others. Banner subsequently becomes a fugitive from the [[U.S. military]] and Ross in particular, who wants to weaponize the Hulk process.\n\n=== Fugitive ===\n{{further|The Incredible Hulk (film)}}\nFive years later in 2011,{{efn|According to Leterrier, the film takes place about five years after Banner's first transformation. The events of the film also simultaneously take place with the events of ''[[Iron Man 2]]'' (2010) and ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]'' (2011), set six months after the events of ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'' (2008).}}<!-- See [[Marvel Cinematic Universe#Timeline]] --> Banner works at a soda bottling factory in [[Rocinha]], [[Rio de Janeiro]] while searching for a cure for his condition, collaborating on the internet with a colleague he knows only as \"Mr. Blue\", and to whom he is \"Mr. Green\". He also learns [[yoga]] techniques to help keep The Hulk under control, and has not transformed in five months. After Banner cuts his finger, a drop of his blood falls into a bottle, and is eventually ingested by an [[Stan Lee|elderly consumer]] in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]], giving him gamma sickness. Ross tracks down Banner, sending a special forces team led by Russian-born British [[Royal Marine]] [[Abomination (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Emil Blonsky]] to capture him. Banner transforms into the Hulk and defeats Blonsky's team. Blonsky agrees to be injected with a similar serum, which gives him enhanced speed, strength, agility, and healing, but also begins to deform his skeleton and impair his judgment.\n\nBanner returns to Culver University and reunites with Betty, but is attacked a second time by Ross and Blonsky's forces, again transforming into the Hulk. The Hulk seemingly kills Blonsky and flees with Betty. After the Hulk reverts to Banner, he and Betty go on the run, and Banner contacts Mr. Blue, who urges them to meet him in New York City. Mr. Blue, revealed to be cellular biologist Dr. [[Samuel Sterns (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Samuel Sterns]], has developed a possible antidote to Banner's condition. After a successful test, he warns Banner that the antidote may only reverse each individual transformation. Sterns reveals he has [[organic synthesis|synthesized]] Banner's blood samples, which Banner sent from Brazil, into a large supply, with the intention of applying its \"limitless potential\" to medicine. Fearful of the Hulk's power falling into the military's hands, Banner wishes to destroy the blood supply. Banner is caught, and Blonsky has Sterns use Banner's blood to turn him into the Abomination. Blonsky then rampages through [[Harlem]]. Realizing that only the Hulk can stop Blonsky, Banner jumps from Ross' helicopter and transforms after hitting the ground. After a long and brutal battle through Harlem, the Hulk defeats Blonsky and flees. Banner soon ends his relationship with Betty, realizing it can no longer work. A month later, in [[Bella Coola, British Columbia]], Banner successfully transforms in a controlled manner.\n\n=== Member of the Avengers ===\n{{see|The Avengers (2012 film)|Iron Man 3|Avengers: Age of Ultron}}\nIn 2012, Banner is working as a doctor in [[Kolkata|Calcutta]] when he is approached by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.

Thor attempts to stop the Hulk's rampage, with Hulk falling to the ground after attacking a S.H.I.E.L.D. fighter jet. In New York City, Banner meets up with Rogers, Stark, Thor, Romanoff, and Barton, becoming a founding member of the [[Avengers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Avengers]]. After the alien species of the [[Species of the Marvel Cinematic Universe#Chitauri|Chitauri]] invade, Banner reveals to Rogers that he is \"always angry\", immediately transforming into the Hulk and stopping a Leviathan. During the battle, he fights the Chitauri, beats Loki into submission in [[Features of the Marvel Cinematic Universe#Avengers Tower|Stark Tower]], and saves Stark from crashing into the ground after losing power through the wormhole.\n\nAfter the Battle of New York, Banner forms a close friendship with Stark and works with him closely, even requesting him to build an anti-Hulk armor to stop him in case he loses control and goes on a rampage. In 2013, Stark shared stories of his [[Iron Man 3|experience with the Extremis formula]] with Banner while they are relaxing in the Tower, seeking advice. Banner falls asleep during it, stating that he was not \"that kind of doctor\".\n\nIn 2015, Banner and the Avengers raid a [[Hydra (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Hydra]] facility in [[Features of the Marvel Cinematic Universe#Sokovia|Sokovia]] and retrieve the scepter. At the Avengers Tower, Stark and Banner discover an [[Artificial intelligence in fiction#Sentient AI|artificial intelligence]] within the scepter's gem, and secretly decide to use it to complete Stark's \"[[Ultron (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Ultron]]\" global defense program. After a celebratory party, Ultron becomes sentient and attacks Banner and the Avengers at the Tower, before escaping. In [[Johannesburg]], Banner and the Avengers try to stop Ultron, but are subdued by [[Wanda Maximoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Wanda Maximoff]] who uses haunting visions to cause the Hulk to rampage in the city until Stark stops him with his [[Features of the Marvel Cinematic Universe#Hulkbuster armor|Hulkbuster armor]]. Banner and the Avengers travel to Barton's home to recover, where Romanoff and Banner develop a mutual attraction. While there, Fury arrives and persuades the Avengers to make a plan to stop Ultron, resulting in Romanoff being captured and taken to Sokovia. Back at the Avengers Tower, Banner and the others have a confrontation after they learn about the creation of the [[Vision (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Vision]], but after Thor powers him, they learn Vision is an ally. Banner leaves the team to rescue Romanoff and transforms into the Hulk in order to fight Ultron. After the final battle with Ultron in Sokovia, the Hulk departs in a [[Features of the Marvel Cinematic Universe#Quinjet|Quinjet]] and leaves Earth.\n\n=== Sakaar and Ragnarok ===\n{{see|Thor: Ragnarok}}\nAfter Hulk is lost in space, the Quinjet crash lands on the landfill planet [[Features of the Marvel Cinematic Universe#Sakaar|Sakaar]]. He is taken in by the [[Grandmaster (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Grandmaster]] of Sakaar, who forces him to fight against other contestants in gladiatorial combat. He rises the ranks, remaining undefeated and winning the admiration of the people of Sakaar, and becoming the Grandmaster's \"Champion\".\n\nIn 2017, Thor crashes on Sakaar, and after being captured by [[Valkyrie (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Valkyrie]], he is forced into combat as well, fighting Hulk in his first matchup. Summoning lightning, Thor gains the upper hand on Hulk, but the Grandmaster sabotages the fight to ensure Hulk's victory. Still enslaved, Thor attempts to convince Hulk to help him save [[Features of the Marvel Cinematic Universe#Asgard|Asgard]] from Ragnarok, and then escapes the palace to find the crashed remains of the Quinjet. Hulk follows Thor to the ship, where a recording of Romanoff makes him transform back into Bruce Banner for the first time in two years. Banner is shocked to learn that he is in space and expresses fear that if he becomes the Hulk again, he will never be able to return to his human form. Banner and Thor ally with Valkyrie and Loki to escape Sakaar to Asgard, where Banner becomes Hulk again to save refugee Asgardians from the giant wolf, [[Fenris Wolf (Marvel Comics)|Fenris]]. As Asgard is destroyed by [[Surtur (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Surtur]], the Hulk accompanies Thor, Valkyrie, Loki, and the Asgardians on the ''[[Features of the Marvel Cinematic Universe#Statesman|Statesman]]'', a Sakaaran vessel bound for Earth.\n\n=== Infinity War ===\n{{see|Avengers: Infinity War}}\nIn 2018, [[Thanos (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thanos]] and the [[Children of Thanos (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Children of Thanos]] intercept the ''Statesman'' to extract the [[Space Stone]] from the Tesseract. Hulk fights Thanos, but is overpowered. [[Heimdall (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Heimdall]] uses the [[Features of the Marvel Cinematic Universe#Bifrost|Bifr\u00f6st Bridge]] to send Hulk straight to Earth, and Hulk crash-lands at the [[Features of the Marvel Cinematic Universe#New York Sanctum|Sanctum Sanctorum]] of [[Stephen Strange (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Stephen Strange]] and [[Wong (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Wong]] in New York City, reverting to Banner. Banner then warns Strange about Thanos, who contacts Stark. When [[Ebony Maw (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Ebony Maw]] and [[Cull Obsidian]] arrive in New York in pursuit of the Time Stone, Banner tries to become the Hulk, but is unable to do so. He goes to the Avengers Compound for the first time reuniting with [[James Rhodes (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|James Rhodes]] and later with Rogers, Romanoff, [[Sam Wilson (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Sam Wilson]], Maximoff, and Vision. He joins the team to [[Features of the Marvel Cinematic Universe#Wakanda|Wakanda]], where he uses Stark's [[Hulkbuster armor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Hulkbuster armor]] to battle the [[Outriders (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Outriders]] and manages to get the upper hand on Obsidian. He is pleased when Thor, [[Rocket (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Rocket]], and [[Groot (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Groot]] arrive to help. In the forest, he witnesses Thanos's arrival, and is promptly trapped in rocks by Thanos and unable to fight back. After Thanos activates the Infinity Gauntlet and teleports away, Banner is a survivor of [[the Blip]].\n\nBanner, the surviving Avengers, and Rocket return to the Avengers Compound and are shortly met by [[Carol Danvers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Carol Danvers]]. He then witnesses Danvers returning Stark back to Earth and reunites with him, helping him get sedated and rest. He accompanies the surviving Avengers, Danvers, Rocket, and [[Nebula (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Nebula]] back into space to the planet [[Features of the Marvel Cinematic Universe#Garden|Titan II]] to confront Thanos only to find out he destroyed the Infinity Stones.{{efn|group=N|As depicted in the 2019 film ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]''.}}\n\n=== Smart Hulk form ===\n==== Time Heist and reversing the Blip ====\n{{Further|Avengers: Endgame}}\n[[File:Mark Ruffalo as \"Professor Hulk\".jpeg|thumb|right|200px|Bruce Banner / Hulk, colloquially dubbed \"Smart Hulk\" or \"Professor Hulk\", as portrayed by Mark Ruffalo via [[motion capture]] in ''Avengers: Endgame'']]\nIn between 2018 and 2023, Banner undergoes gamma experimentation to balance his two sides in a remote beach house lab located in Mexico built by Stark.

At the Avengers Compound, they try to time-travel Lang using [[Hank Pym (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Hank Pym]]'s quantum tunnel but are unsuccessful. After Stark arrives and offers his help, Banner and Rocket travel to [[Norway]] to the colony New Asgard, and recruit a depressed drunken Thor to return to help the Avengers. Back at the Compound, the Avengers formulate a plan to time-travel and retrieve alternate Infinity Stones. Banner, Rogers, Stark, and Lang time-travel via the [[Quantum Realm]] to an alternate 2012 in New York City. There Banner gets the Time Stone from an alternate version of the [[Ancient One (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Ancient One]] (to whom he promises to return the Stones to their respective periods in time when the Avengers are done with their mission).\n\nBanner then returns to the present, but is devastated to learn of Romanoff's death, who had to sacrifice herself to retrieve the Soul Stone. After mourning her with the original Avengers, Banner, Stark, and Rocket combine the stones with the Stark Gauntlet. Banner then volunteers to activate the Infinity Stones, citing his general strength and his specific resistance to gamma radiation. He does so and reverses [[the Blip]], though his right arm gets seriously injured in the process. After doing so, an alternate version of Thanos emerges from the quantum realm and attacks the Compound, causing Banner, Rocket, and Rhodes to be trapped in rubble, until they are saved by Lang. He then takes part in the final battle against Thanos and his army, who are eventually defeated when Stark uses the Infinity Stones, at the cost of his own life. After the battle, Banner attends Stark's funeral, and then prepares a new quantum portal so that Rogers can return the alternate Infinity Stones and Mjolnir. He, [[Bucky Barnes (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Bucky Barnes]], and Sam Wilson witness an elderly Rogers return and give his shield to Wilson.\n\n==== Meeting Shang-Chi ====\n{{Further|Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings}}\nBy 2024, Banner creates a device to heal his arm, keeping him in human form,<ref>{{Cite web |title=Why Is Bruce Banner No Longer Hulk In Shang-Chi (Endgame Retcon)? |url=https://screenrant.com/shang-chi-bruce-banner-hulk-change-human-endgame-retcon/ |website=ScreenRant |access-date=September 13, 2021 |date=September 11, 2021 |archive-date=September 12, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210912214608/https://screenrant.com/shang-chi-bruce-banner-hulk-change-human-endgame-retcon/ |url-status=live }}</ref>{{bsn|reason=She-Hulk ref for the device|date=August 2022}} and wears a [[Sling (medicine)|sling]] due to the injury he sustained while reversing the Blip, though the scarring has healed.

Banner bleeds, and his blood is accidentally cross-contamined with Walters', resulting in Walters transforming into a Hulk and running away; Banner eventually retrieves her and uses the lethal gamma dose she took to completely heal his arm. In Mexico, Banner trains Walters on controlling her Hulk form, however she rejects the idea of being a superhero and wants to return to her legal career. The pair get into a fight and Banner eventually accepts Walters wanting to leave and bids her farewell. A few months later, Banner takes off in the Sakaaran spaceship to investigate the message from the car crash; while there, he receives a call from Walters and encourages her to take on the case of representing Emil Blonsky, as they have made amends. Banner also indicates approval of Walters' new superhero name \"She-Hulk\", given to her by the media, saying that \"She-Hulk, attorney-at-law\" has a nice ring to it.\n\nLater, Bruce returns to Earth, arrives at Blonsky's retreat and fights him, but Jen breaks the fourth wall and has the producer delete this plotline. Some time after that, Bruce appears at a family gathering and introduces his son [[Skaar (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Skaar]] to Jen, her family, and [[Matt Murdock (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Matt Murdock]].\n\n==Alternate versions==\n{{See also|What If...?

The three are surrounded by Ross's troops, and Banner transforms into the Hulk after being hit by a bullet. While attacking Ross's men, the Hulk suddenly inflates and explodes due to a [[Pym Particles (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Pym Particles]] disk secretly deployed by [[Hank Pym (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Yellowjacket]] inside his body.\n\n===Zombie outbreak===\n{{Further|What If...

After joining with the other survivors, they journey to [[Camp Lehigh]] and encounter Vision, who reveals that the Mind Stone can be used to cure the virus.

I grew up on the Bill Bixby TV series, which I thought was a really nuanced and real human way to look at the Hulk.

Ruffalo described Hulk in ''Infinity War'' as having the mental capacity of a five-year-old.<ref name=\"ColliderRuffaloBosemanMarch2018\" /> Despite the lack of further standalone films, \"Bruce and the Hulk have managed to eke out a character arc in the six years since ''The Avengers''\", with ''Thor: Ragnarok'' and ''Infinity War'' highlighting an ongoing battle for control of which persona will manifest, expected to be resolved in ''Avengers: Endgame''.<ref name=\"ScreenRantHulkArc\" /> In ''Avengers: Endgame'', the Bruce Banner and the Hulk personalities are shown to have reconciled and merged into Professor Hulk, who has the strength of the Hulk but the intelligence of Bruce Banner.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://ew.com/movies/2019/04/27/avengers-endgame-hulk/|title=Avengers: Endgame explained: The Hulk's closing scene|magazine=Entertainment Weekly|date=April 27, 2019|access-date=May 1, 2019|first=Anthony|last=Breznican|archive-date=April 27, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190427165619/https://ew.com/movies/2019/04/27/avengers-endgame-hulk/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"Gizmodo\">{{cite web|url=https://gizmodo.com/professor-hulk-is-avengers-endgames-gift-to-bruce-bann-1834481486|title=Professor Hulk Is Avengers: Endgame's Gift to Bruce Banner|first=Charles|last=Pulliam-Moore|website=Gizmodo|date=May 7, 2019|access-date=May 30, 2022|archive-date=May 30, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220530203511/https://gizmodo.com/professor-hulk-is-avengers-endgames-gift-to-bruce-bann-1834481486|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Appearance and special effects ===\nIn filming ''The Incredible Hulk'', Leterrier cited [[Andy Serkis]]' [[motion capture]] portrayals of [[Gollum]] and [[King Kong]] in ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings]]'' and ''[[King Kong (2005 film)|King Kong]]'', respectively, as the standard for which he was aiming.<ref name=\"Keown\" /> Norton and Roth filmed 2500 takes of different movements the monsters would make (such as the Hulk's \"thunder claps\").<ref name=\"ProdNotes\" /> [[Phosphorescent]] [[face paint]] applied to the actors' faces and [[strobe light]]ing would help record the most subtle mannerisms into the computer.<ref name=\"LATimesShade\" /> Others including [[Cyril Raffaelli]] provided motion capture for stunts and fights,<ref name=\"IGNRoth\" /> after the main actors had done video referencing.<ref name=\"DVDBecomingHulk\" /> Leterrier hired [[Rhythm and Hues Studios|Rhythm and Hues]] to provide the CGI, rather than [[Industrial Light & Magic]] (ILM) who created the visual effects for Ang Lee's ''Hulk''. Visual effect company, [[Image Engine]], spent over a year working on a shot where Banner's gamma-irradiated blood falls through three factory floors into a bottle.<ref name=\"VancouverSun\" /> Overall 700 effects shots were created. Motion capture aided in placing and timing of movements, but overall [[key frame]] animation by Rhythm and Hues provided the necessary \"finesse [and] superhero quality\".<ref name=\"SFXfinesse\" />\n\n[[Dale Keown]]'s comic book artwork of the Hulk was an inspiration for his design.<ref name=\"Keown\" /> Leterrier felt the first Hulk had \"too much fat [and] the proportions were a little off\". He explained, \"The Hulk is beyond perfect so there is zero grams of fat, all chiseled, and his muscle and strength defines this creature so he's like a tank.\"<ref name=\"Keown\" /> [[Visual effects supervisor]] Kurt Williams envisioned the Hulk's physique as a [[linebacker]] rather than a [[bodybuilder]]. A height of n<!-- Blonsky's estimate is a personal guess, not the actual height the filmmakers made for the digital model-->ine feet was chosen for the character as they did not want him to be too inhuman. To make him more expressive, computer programs controlling the inflation of his muscles and saturation of skin color were created. Williams cited [[flushing (physiology)|flushing]] as an example of humans' skin color being influenced by their emotions.<ref name=\"ProdNotes\" /> The animators felt green blood would make his skin become darker rather than lighter, and his skin tones, depending on lighting, either resemble an [[olive]] or even gray [[slate]].<ref name=\"LATimesShade\" /> His animation model was completed without the effects company's full knowledge of what he would be required to do: he was rigged to do whatever they imagined, in case the model was to be used for ''The Avengers'' film.<ref name=\"SFXfinesse\" /> The Hulk's medium-length hair was modeled on [[Mike Deodato]]'s art.<ref name=\"SFXfinesse\" /> He originally had a [[crew cut]], but Leterrier decided flopping hair imbued him with more character.<ref name=\"DVDBecomingHulk\" /> Leterrier cited ''[[An American Werewolf in London]]'' as the inspiration for Banner's transformation, wanting to show how painful it was for him to change.<ref name=\"AICNEditingBay\" /> As a nod to the live action TV series, Banner's eyes change color first when he transforms.<ref name=\"MTVEyes\" />\n\n''The Avengers'' was the first production in which the actor playing Banner also plays the Hulk. Ruffalo told ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine, \"I'm really excited. No one's ever played the Hulk exactly; they've always done CGI. They're going to do the ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'' stop-action, stop-motion capture. So I'll actually play the Hulk. That'll be fun\".<ref name=\"NYMag\" /> The [[3D modeling|3D model]] used to create the Hulk's body was modeled after [[Long Island]] bodybuilder and male stripper Steve Romm, while the Hulk's face was modeled after Ruffalo.<ref name=\"CastRuffalo1\" /> To create the on-screen Hulk, Ruffalo performed in a motion-capture suit on set with the other actors while four motion-capture HD cameras (two full body, two focused on his face) captured his face and body movements.<ref name=\"fxguide\" /> ILM returned to create the digital Hulk. [[Jeff White (visual effects)|Jeff White]], ILM's visual effects supervisor, said, \"We really wanted to utilize everything we've developed the last 10 years and make it a pretty spectacular Hulk. One of the great design decisions was to incorporate Mark Ruffalo into the look of him. So, much of Hulk is based on Ruffalo and his performance, not only in motion capture and on set, but down to his eyes, his teeth, and his tongue.\"<ref name=\"AWN\" />\n\nFor ''Thor: Ragnarok'', ILM had to add much more detail to the character's facial features, due to the Hulk's increased dialogue. ILM visual effects supervisor Chad Wiebe explained that Ruffalo's expressions were captured fresh for the film using Medusa, a performance capture technology. With 90 different expressions captured, ILM \"built an entirely new library that would allow [Hulk] to cover a full range of normal human visual characteristics.\"<ref name=\"FXGuidePart2\" /> To help create the Hulk, a person on set was covered in green body paint, and would replicate the intended motions of the character to aid the visual effect artists.<ref name=\"ColliderSep2017Trivia\" /> Additionally, stunt actor Paul Lowe, who is under {{convert|5|ft|m}} tall, stood in for Hemsworth during some of his interactions with the Hulk so that the Hulk's stunt men would be proportionally correct. In some instances when Thor and the Hulk interacted, a digital double was used for Thor, also created by ILM, to have greater flexibility for the shots. ILM worked on all of the Hulk moments in the film outside the final fight sequence, which was completed by Framestore using ILM's assets, as Framestore was primarily responsible for [[Skeletal animation|rigging]] that sequence. Framestore completed nearly 460 shots, which featured digital doubles of Thor and Hela, Fenris, Korg, Miek, the giant Surtur at the end of the film, and over 9,000 buildings for Asgard, based on assets D Negative had from ''The Dark World'', resulting in over 263 character, vehicle, prop, and crowd rigs.<ref name=\"FXGuidePart2\" /> Taika Waititi also provided additional motion capture for the Hulk after Ruffalo had completed his scenes.<ref name=\"WaititiColliderSep2017\" />\n\nWith respect to Bruce Banner's regular appearance, his fashion sense has been critiqued with the observation that \"in just about every appearance, he's wearing a nondescript suit with a purple button down shirt\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2018/04/a-serious-critique-of-the-mcus-off-duty-fashion.html|title=A Serious Critique of the MCU's Street Style|publisher=Vulture|first=Arye|last=Dworken|date=April 23, 2018|access-date=December 23, 2018|archive-date=December 20, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181220230630/https://www.vulture.com/2018/04/a-serious-critique-of-the-mcus-off-duty-fashion.html|url-status=live}}</ref> By contrast, Banner's \"Professor Hulk\" appearance in ''Avengers: Endgame'', including his penchant for knit sweaters, has been described as \"hot\" and \"sexy\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/Hulk-Hot-Avengers-Endgame-46078093|title=Uh, So, There Are a Lot of People Who Think the Hulk Is Hot Now After Seeing Avengers: Endgame|first=Quinn|last=Keaney|date=May 2, 2019|access-date=May 30, 2022|archive-date=May 30, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220530203511/https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/Hulk-Hot-Avengers-Endgame-46078093|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\nNorton's performance as Banner received a generally positive reception. Reviewing ''The Incredible Hulk'', Mark Rahner of ''[[The Seattle Times]]'' wrote that, \"The relaunch of Marvel's green goliath is an improvement over director Ang Lee's ponderous 2003 ''Hulk'' in nearly every way\u2014except that the actual Hulk still looks scarcely better than something from a video game, and he still barely talks\".<ref name=\"RahnerReview\" /> Conversely, [[Christy Lemire]] of the ''[[Associated Press]]'' found that \"the inevitable comparisons to ''Iron Man'', Marvel Studios' first blockbuster this summer, serve as a glaring reminder of what this Hulk lacks: wit and heart. Despite the presence of Edward Norton, an actor capable of going just as deep as Robert Downey Jr., we don't feel a strong sense of Bruce Banner's inner conflict\".<ref name=\"LemireReview\" />\n\nMark Ruffalo's portrayal of Dr. Bruce Banner/the Hulk in ''The Avengers'' was well received by commentators. Joe Neumaier opined that his performance was superior to the rest of the cast; \"Ruffalo is the revelation, turning Banner into a wry reservoir of calm ready to become a volcano.\"<ref name=\"nydaily2012\" /> Similarly, ''[[The New Yorker]]''{{'s}} [[Anthony Lane]] proclaimed Ruffalo's acting to be one of the film's highlights\u2014alongside Downey.<ref name=\"newyorker2012\" /> ''[[The Village Voice]]''{{'s}} [[Karina Longworth]] concluded: \"Ruffalo successfully refreshes the Hulk myth, playing Banner as an adorably bashful nerd-genius who, in contrast to the preening hunks on the team, knows better than to draw attention to himself.\"<ref name=\"villagevoice\" /> Travers asserted that the actor resonated a \"scruffy warmth and humor\" vibe,<ref name=\"rollz\" /> while Turan felt that he surpassed predecessors Edward Norton and [[Eric Bana]] in playing the character.<ref name=\"LATimes2\" /> Owen Gleiberman of ''Entertainment Weekly'' wrote that \"the smartest thing the filmmakers did was to get Mark Ruffalo to play Bruce Banner as a man so sensitive that he's at war, every moment, with himself. (The film finally solves the Hulk problem: He's a lot more fun in small doses)\".<ref name=\"EW-review\" />\n\n===Accolades===\n{{Anchor|Awards|Accolades}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

Created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Jack Kirby]], the character first appeared in the debut issue of ''[[The Incredible Hulk (comic book)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' (May 1962). In his comic book appearances, the character, who has [[dissociative identity disorder]] (DID), is primarily represented by the alter ego Hulk, a green-skinned, hulking and muscular humanoid possessing a limitless degree of physical strength, and the alter ego '''Dr. Robert Bruce Banner''', a physically weak, socially withdrawn, and emotionally reserved physicist, both of whom typically resent each other.\n\nFollowing his accidental exposure to [[gamma ray]]s while saving the life of [[Rick Jones (character)|Rick Jones]] during the detonation of an experimental bomb, Banner is physically transformed into the Hulk when subjected to emotional stress, at or against his will. This transformation often leads to destructive rampages and to conflicts that complicate Banner's civilian life. The Hulk's level of strength is normally conveyed as proportionate to his level of anger. Commonly portrayed as a raging savage, the Hulk has been represented with other alter egos, from a mindless, destructive force ([[Horsemen of Apocalypse#Hulk|'''War''']]), to a brilliant warrior ('''World-Breaker'''), a [[Self-hatred|self-hating]] protector (the [[Immortal Hulk|'''Devil'''/'''Immortal''']]), a genius scientist in his own right ('''Doc Green'''), and a [[gangster]] ('''Joe Fixit'''). It is later revealed Banner's DID formed from being [[Child abuse|abused]] by his father [[Brian Banner|Brian]] as a child and that the alter egos known as Fixit and the Devil/Immortal Hulk originally manifested during his childhood, with a malevolent identity embodying his guilt, shame, and regret towards his father (based on him) manifesting as the [[Guilt Hulk|'''Guilt''']].\n\nDespite both Hulk and Banner's desire for solitude, the character has a large supporting cast. This includes Banner's ex-wife [[Betty Ross]], his best friend Rick Jones, his cousin [[She-Hulk]], and therapist and ally [[Doc Samson]]. In addition, the Hulk alter ego has many key supporting characters, like his co-founders of the superhero team the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], his queen [[Caiera]], fellow warriors [[Korg (character)|Korg]] and [[Miek]], and sons [[Skaar (comics)|Skaar]] and [[Hiro-Kala]]. However, his uncontrollable power has brought him into conflict with his fellow heroes and others. Despite this, he tries his best to do what's right while battling villains such as the [[Leader (comics)|Leader]], the [[Abomination (comics)|Abomination]], the [[Absorbing Man]] and more.\n\nLee stated that the Hulk's creation was inspired by a combination of ''[[Frankenstein's monster|Frankenstein]]'' and ''[[Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (character)|Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde]]''.<ref name=\"HulkTIG\">{{Cite book | last=DeFalco | first=Tom | title=The Hulk: The Incredible Guide | publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] | date=2003 | location=London, United Kingdom | page=200 | isbn=978-0-7894-9260-9 | url=https://archive.org/details/hulkincrediblegu0000defa | url-access=registration }}</ref> Although the Hulk's coloration has varied throughout the character's publication history, the most usual color is green.\n\nOne of the most iconic characters in popular culture,<ref name=\"HulkIconic\"/><ref name=\"HulkIconic2\"/> the character has appeared on a variety of merchandise, such as clothing and collectable items, inspired real-world structures (such as theme park attractions), and been referenced in a number of media. Banner and the Hulk have been adapted in live-action, animated, and video game incarnations. The character was first played in live-action by [[Bill Bixby]] and [[Lou Ferrigno]] in the 1978 television series ''[[The Incredible Hulk (1978 TV series)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' and its subsequent television films ''[[The Incredible Hulk Returns]]'' (1988), ''[[The Trial of the Incredible Hulk]]'' (1989), and ''[[The Death of the Incredible Hulk]]'' (1990), then by [[Eric Bana]] in the film ''[[Hulk (film)|Hulk]]'' (2003). In the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU), [[Bruce Banner (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|the character]] was first portrayed by [[Edward Norton]] in the film ''[[The Incredible Hulk (film)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' (2008) and then by [[Mark Ruffalo]] in ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'' (2012), ''[[Iron Man 3]]'' (2013), ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]'' (2015), ''[[Thor: Ragnarok]]'' (2017), ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'' (2018), ''[[Captain Marvel (film)|Captain Marvel]]'' (2019), ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'' (2019), ''[[Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings]]'' (2021), the television series ''[[She-Hulk: Attorney at Law]]'' (2022), and the animated series ''[[What If...?

For a long time, I'd been aware of the fact that people were more likely to favor someone who was less than perfect. ... It's a safe bet that you remember [[Quasimodo]], but how easily can you name any of the heroic, handsomer, more glamorous characters in ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]''?

Banner, a [[physicist]] who earned his Ph.D. in nuclear physics from [[California Institute of Technology|Caltech]], is sarcastic and seemingly very self-assured when he first appears in ''Incredible Hulk'' #1, but is also emotionally withdrawn.<ref name=\"HulkTIG\"/> Banner designed the gamma bomb that caused his affliction, and the ironic twist of his self-inflicted fate has been one of the most persistent common themes.<ref name=\"OyVey\">{{Cite book|last= Weinstein|first= Simcha|title= Up, Up, and Oy Vey!|publisher= Leviathan Press| date= 2006|location= Baltimore, Maryland|pages= 82\u201397|isbn=978-1-881927-32-7}}</ref> Arie Kaplan describes the character thus: \"Robert Bruce Banner lives in a constant state of panic, always wary that the monster inside him will erupt, and therefore he cannot form meaningful bonds with anyone.\"<ref name=Kaplan>{{Cite book|last= Kaplan|first= Arie|title= Masters of the Comic Book Universe Revealed!|publisher= [[Chicago Review Press]]|date= 2006|page= 58|location= Chicago, Illinois|isbn=978-1556526336}}</ref> As a child, Banner's father [[Brian Banner|Brian]] often got mad and physically abused both Banner and his mother, creating the [[complex (psychology)|psychological complex]] of fear, anger, and the fear of anger and the destruction it can cause that underlies the character. Banner has been shown to be emotionally repressed, but capable of deep love for Betty Ross, and for solving problems posed to him. Under the writing of Paul Jenkins, Banner was shown to be a capable fugitive, applying deductive reasoning and observation to figure out the events transpiring around him. On the occasions that Banner controlled the Hulk's body, he applied principles of physics to problems and challenges and used deductive reasoning. It was shown after his ability to turn into the Hulk was taken away by the red Hulk that Banner has been extremely versatile as well as cunning when dealing with the many situations that followed. When he was briefly separated from the Hulk by Doom, Banner became criminally insane, driven by his desire to regain the power of the Hulk, but once the two recombined he came to accept that he was a better person with the Hulk to provide something for him to focus on controlling rather than allowing his intellect to run without restraint against the world.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Aaron, Jason|penciller= Palo, Jefte|inker= Palo, Jefte|story= Hulk: United Part 1|title= The Incredible Hulk|volume= 4|issue= 13|date= November 2012|publisher=Marvel Comics}}</ref>\n\n====Hulk====\nThe original Hulk was shown as grey and average in intelligence. He roamed aimlessly and became annoyed at \"puny\" humans who took him for a dangerous monster. Shortly after becoming the Hulk, his transformation continued turning him green, coinciding with him beginning to display primitive speech. <ref name=\"NewsAramaPg2\"/> By ''Incredible Hulk'' #4, radiation treatments gave Banner's mind complete control of the Hulk's body. While Banner relished his indestructibility and power, he was quick to anger and more aggressive in his Hulk form. He became known as a hero alongside the Avengers, but his increasing paranoia caused him to leave the group. He was convinced that he would never be trusted.<ref name=\"NewsAramaPg3\"/>\n\nOriginally, the Hulk was shown as simple-minded and quick to anger.<ref name=Hulk4>{{cite comic| writer= Lee, Stan|penciller= Kirby, Jack|inker= [[Dick Ayers|Ayers, Dick]]|story= The Monster and the Machine!|title= The Incredible Hulk|issue= 4|date= November 1962}}</ref> The Hulk generally divorces his identity from Banner's, decrying Banner as \"puny Banner.\"<ref>{{cite comic|writer= Milgrom, Al|penciller= Milgrom, Al|inker= Janke, Dennis|story= The Monster's Analyst|title= The Incredible Hulk|volume= 2|issue= 221|date= September 1972}}</ref> From his earliest stories, the Hulk has been concerned with finding sanctuary and quiet. <ref name=\"OyVey\"/> He is often shown to quickly react emotionally to situations.

Hulk retains a modest intelligence, thinking and talking in full sentences. Lee even gives the Hulk expository dialogue in issue #6, allowing readers to learn just what capabilities Hulk has, when the Hulk says, \"But these muscles ain't just for show! All I gotta do is spring up and just keep goin'!\" In the 1970s, Hulk was shown as more prone to anger and rage, and less talkative.

Due to ink problems, Hulk's color was changed to green. This was later changed in the story to indicate that the {{anchor|Grey Hulk}}'''grey Hulk''' and the '''savage Hulk''' are separate [[Dissociative identity disorder|dissociative identities]] or entities fighting for control in Bruce's subconscious. The Grey Hulk incarnation can do the more unscrupulous things that Banner could not bring himself to do, with many sources comparing the grey Hulk to the moody teenager that Banner never allowed himself to be. While the grey Hulk still had the-madder-he-gets, the-stronger-he-gets part that is similar to the savage Hulk, it is on a much slower rate. It is said by the Leader that the grey Hulk is stronger on nights of the new moon and weaker on nights of the full moon. Originally, the night is when Bruce Banner became the Grey Hulk and changed back by dawn. In later comics, willpower or stress would have Banner turn into the grey Hulk.<ref>{{cite comic|writer= Milgrom, Al|penciller= Milgrom, Al|inker= Janke, Dennis|story= The More Things Change ...|title= The Incredible Hulk|volume= 2|issue= 324|date= October 1986}}</ref> During one storyline where he was placed under a spell to prevent him turning back into Bruce Banner and publicly presumed dead when he was teleported away from a gamma bomb explosion that destroyed an entire town, the grey Hulk adopted a specific name as {{anchor|Joe Fixit}}'''Joe Fixit''', a security guard for a Las Vegas casino owner, with the grey Hulk often being referred to as Joe after these events.<ref>{{cite comic |title=The Incredible Hulk |volume=2 |issue=347 |date=September 1988 |writer=Peter David |penciller=Jeff Purves |inker=Mike Gustovich |story=Crapshoot}}</ref> Joe Fixit later gained the ability to transform into his version of '''[[Red Hulk]]''' form when in the Below-Place.<ref>''Immortal Hulk'' #45.

This new {{anchor|Merged Hulk}}'''Merged Hulk''', '''Professor Hulk''', or simply '''The Professor''', considered himself cured and began a new life, but the merger was not perfect, and the Hulk sometimes still considered Banner a separate person, and when overcome with rage the Merged Hulk would transform back into Banner's human body while still thinking himself the Hulk.<ref name=\"NewsAramaPg9\"/> The Merged Hulk is the largest of the three primary Hulk incarnations. While in a calm emotional state, the Merged Hulk is stronger than Savage Hulk when he is calm. Unlike the Savage Hulk and the Grey Hulk, Banner subconsciously installed a type of safeguard within this incarnation. The safeguard is that when the Merged Hulk gets angry, he regresses back to Banner with the mind of the Savage Hulk.<ref>{{cite comic|writer= David, Peter|penciller= Keown, Dale|inker= Farmer, Mark|story= Hit and Myth|title= The Incredible Hulk|volume= 2|issue= 379|date= March 1991}}</ref>\n\nUltimately, of the Merged Hulk identity takes on the name '''Doc Green'' as the result of Extremis fixing Hulk's brain, becoming powerful enough to destroy Tony Stark's mansion with one thunderclap.<ref name=\"Hulk #5\"/>\n\n===={{anchor|Devil Hulk}}{{anchor|Immortal Hulk}}The Devil/Immortal====\nThe '''[[Devil Hulk]]''' or '''[[Immortal Hulk]]''', or simply the '''Devil''' or '''Immortal''', is the result of the Hulk needing a father figure.

Marvel Comics.</ref> The new form of the Devil Hulk is the result of Banner and Hulk having been through different deaths and rebirths. This incarnation is articulate, smart, and cunning, and does merciless attacks on those who do harm. Unlike the other Hulk incarnations, the Devil Hulk is content with waiting inside Bruce. If Bruce is injured by sunset, the Devil Hulk will emerge with his transformation being limited to night-time.<ref name=\"Immortal Hulk\"/> Thanks to the Devil Hulk side and Banner working together, the Devil Hulk can maintain his form in sunlight.<ref>''Immortal Hulk'' #27. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n====Other identities====\nThe {{anchor|Gravage Hulk}}'''Gravage Hulk''' is the result of Banner using the Gamma Projector on himself which merged his Savage Hulk and Grey Hulk identities. This form possesses the raw power of the Savage Hulk and the cunning intellect of the Grey Hulk. While he does not draw on anger to empower him, the Gravage Hulk identity draws on dimensional nexus energies to increase his strength.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' Vol. 3 #60.

Using this knowledge, he creates advanced technology dubbed \"Bannertech\", which is on par with technological development from Tony Stark or Doctor Doom. Some of these technologies include a [[Force shield|force field]] that can protect him from the attacks of Hulk-level entities, and a [[Teleportation|teleporter]].\n\nAfter becoming a fugitive from the law, Banner is forced to go on the run and over the years learns various skills in order to both survive and remain under radar of those who are hunting him. Banner is generally on the move and rarely ever stays in one place for very long and only does so if there\u2019s a possibility of curing himself. He will only ever stay in one place for an extended period of time if it provides him with complete solitude and privacy where the Hulk can do little to no harm. \n\nTo avoid being tracked, Banner does not use cell phones, debit or credit cards and will only use payphone or cash instead. To support himself financially, Banner will work quick part time jobs and will only accept payments in cash. Often traveling light, Banner has little to no possessions that he carries in either a satchels or backpack. He will often use fake identities when staying at motels or working jobs that require identification. Having been on the run for years, Banner can normally tell when he is being followed and will generally make a run for it when he is discovered. \n\nDuring his travels, Banner has developed several different techniques to help suppress or control his transformations when he becomes a little angry or upset. Among the techniques he\u2019s learned over the years include meditation and hypnotherapy. While they have helped him to better understand and suppress becoming the Hulk, none of techniques Banner has learned have helped him to gain full control over the Hulk.\n\n=== The Hulk ===\nThe Hulk possesses the potential for seemingly limitless physical strength that is influenced by his emotional state, particularly his anger.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Pak, Greg|penciller= [[Carlo Pagulayan|Pagulayan, Carlo]]|inker= Huet, Jeffrey|story= Warbound -- Part IV|title= The Incredible Hulk|volume= 3|issue= 109|date= October 2007}}</ref> This has been reflected in the repeated comment \"The madder Hulk gets, the stronger Hulk gets.\"<ref>Achenbach, Joel (June 19, 2003).
