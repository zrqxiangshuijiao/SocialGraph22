Despite his power and loyalty to his lord [[Belasco (comics)|Belasco]], Belasco passes him over as a potential apprentice, seeing demons as fit only to be servants. When [[Magik (comics)|Illyana Rasputin]] rises up to replace Belasco as lord of [[Features of the Marvel Universe#Extradimensional planes|Otherplace]], N'astirh steals Belasco's spellbook and flees from Limbo into Earth's past. After years of study, he masters all the spells in the book.<ref>''The New Mutants'' #71</ref>\n\nN'astirh makes an alliance with [[Cameron Hodge]].<ref>''X-Factor'' #32</ref> N'astirh's demons then kidnap [[Artie Maddicks]] and [[Leech (comics)|Leech]].<ref>''X-Terminators'' #1</ref> Using Belasco's stolen book of spells, N'astirh sends demons to abduct mutant infants, and is brought computer expert [[Taki Matsuya|Wiz Kid]] as a captive.<ref>''X-Terminators'' #2</ref> N'astirh is informed by Cameron Hodge about [[Mister Sinister]]'s orphanage for mutant children.<ref>''X-Factor'' #34</ref> N'astirh coerces Wiz Kid to create a computer to process magic.<ref>''X-Terminators'' #3</ref> When the [[Jason Macendale|Hobgoblin]] offers to make a [[Faustian]] bargain to trade his soul for the power of a demon, N'astirh scoffs at the offer, and on a whim, he grants Hobgoblin the requested power free of charge by fusing him with a demon,<ref>''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #147</ref> which would eventually break away to become the [[Demogoblin]].<ref>''Web of Spider-Man'' #86</ref> [[Warren Worthington III|Archangel]] vows vengeance on N'astirh for the encouragement he provided to Cameron Hodge.<ref>''X-Factor'' #36</ref> N'astirh also makes a pact with [[Madelyne Pryor]], who uses this alliance to get revenge against the [[Marauders (comics)|Marauders]] and the safe return of her son [[Cable (comics)|Nathan]].<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #239-241</ref>\n\nMadelyne Pryor, N'astirh and [[S'ym]] plot [[Inferno (Marvel Comics)|a demonic invasion]], starting with [[Manhattan]]. N'astirh and S'ym manipulate Illyana Rasputin into opening an inter-dimensional portal at the [[Empire State Building]], through which N'astirh's demons invade Manhattan.<ref name=\"mnyc\">{{cite book | last = Sanderson | first = Peter | title = The Marvel Comics Guide to New York City | publisher = [[Pocket Books]] | year = 2007 | location = New York City | pages = 49\u201351 | isbn = 978-1-416-53141-8}}</ref> [[Kang the Conqueror]] sends his minion, the [[Growing Man]] to attack N'astirh's demon horde.<ref>''The Avengers'' #300 (February 1989)</ref>  During the invasion, N'astirh coerces Illyana, [[Meggan (character)|Meggan]], and Madelyne towards their darker sides, Magik having a tie to Limbo, Meggan being an [[empathy|empathic]] [[shapeshifting|shapeshifter]] who is swayed by the dark emotions around her (transforming her into the '''Goblin Princess'''), and Madelyne having her psionic powers triggered, transforming her into the '''Goblin Queen'''.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #240</ref>  Illyana eventually closes the portal, sealing the demons in Limbo.<ref>''The New Mutants'' #71-73</ref>\n\nWhile N'astirh battles S'ym for rule of Limbo and Earth, he is infected and transformed by the transmode virus. He claims he has 'become' magic, since he can now process and cast spells almost simultaneously.<ref>''X-Terminators'' #4; ''The New Mutants'' #72</ref>\n\nN'astirh captures Nathan Christopher Summers. When N'astirh learns Madelyne has fallen into madness, he returns and presents Madylyne her son as chief sacrifice.<ref>''X-Factor'' #37</ref> He is ultimately destroyed by an overload of lightning driven into him by [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]].<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #242</ref>\n\nMuch later, N'astirh was apparently resurrected by Illyana Rasputin, who herself had been resurrected by Belasco. He no longer seems to possess the enhancements and abilities given to him as a result of his exposure to the techno-organic virus. He also appears to be far more animalistic and savage than before and has not displayed any of the cunning and manipulative personality traits he once had.<ref>''New X-Men'' vol. 2 #41</ref>\n\nHe returns during the Second Coming event, where is revealed that N'astirth is the mastermind who abducted Magik, after he and S'ym cut a deal with Bastion's forces and provided them with a \"weaponized ritual\" that sent Magik back to Limbo.<ref>''X-Men: Second Coming - Revelations: Hellbound'' #1</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nVast magical powers grant him the ability to manipulate the forces of magic for various effects, generate mystical energy as force bolts and protective shields, increase his size and strength, regenerate his injuries and tap into the innate evil of humans and turn them into demons with a touch. He also has the ability of flight due to his natural leather wings.\n\nTransformation by the techno-organic transmode virus allows him the ability to alter his own shape and can rebuild his body from a single cell when destroyed or injured, and he can infect others with the transmode virus, converting them into \"techno-organic\" beings and absorbing their life energy. The virus also granted him a computer like mind allowing him to cast spells and process them almost simultaneously.\n\nN'astirh has a gifted intellect, and possesses extensive knowledge of black magic gained through study of Belasco's principal book of sorcery.\n\n==In other media==\n\n===Video games===\n* Android replicas of N'astirh appear in ''[[Spider-Man/X-Men: Arcade's Revenge]]'' as mini-bosses.\n* N'astirh appears in ''[[Marvel Heroes (video game)|Marvel Heroes]]'', voiced by [[Steven Blum]].{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.marvel.com/universe/N%27astirh N'astirh] at Marvel.com\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20050215143242/http://www.uncannyxmen.net/db/characters/showquestion.asp?fldAuto=1316 Uncannyxmen.net bio]\n* {{Marveldatabase}}\n\n{{X-Men characters}}\n\n[[Category:Characters created by Louise Simonson]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1988]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics demons]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics male supervillains]]"}]}}}}
