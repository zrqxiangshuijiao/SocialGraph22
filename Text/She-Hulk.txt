The reason behind the character's creation had to do with the success of ''[[The Incredible Hulk (1978 TV series)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' (1977\u20131982) and ''[[The Bionic Woman]]'' television series, both from [[Universal Television]].

She-Hulk then made guest appearances in other characters' books. Her earliest guest-starring adventures followed no specific story line, besides her recurring bad luck with automobiles. She-Hulk also appeared in the limited series, ''[[Marvel Super Hero Contest of Champions]]'' (June to August 1982), in which numerous superheroes are kidnapped from Earth to fight in [[Outer space|space]].\n\nShe-Hulk becomes a member of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] in ''[[The Avengers (comic book)|Avengers]]'' #221 (July 1982). Her early Avengers appearances continued the [[running gag]] about her car troubles.<ref>''The Avengers'' #221\u2013222</ref> She-Hulk also made occasional guest appearances in ''The Incredible Hulk''. Her appearance in ''The Avengers'' #233 (July 1983) was drawn by [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]], who would later become strongly associated with the character. <!--Perhaps someone could verify whether ''Avengers'' #233 was Byrne's very first She-Hulk art?-->\n\nAt the conclusion of the first ''[[Secret Wars]]'' miniseries, She-Hulk joins the Fantastic Four (''Fantastic Four'' #265 (April 1984)). During She-Hulk's tenure with the Fantastic Four, she appeared in ''[[Marvel Graphic Novel]]'' #16: ''The Aladdin Effect'', ''[[Marvel Graphic Novel]]'' No. 17: ''Revenge of the Living Monolith'', and ''Marvel Graphic Novel'' #18: ''The Sensational She-Hulk''. All three graphic novels appeared in 1985. The last, #18, appearing in November 1985, was written and illustrated by then-Fantastic Four writer/artist John Byrne.\n\nShe-Hulk regained a solo series in 1989, ''The Sensational She-Hulk'' (maintaining the 1985 [[graphic novel]]'s title). ''The Sensational She-Hulk'' ran for 60 issues. Issues #1\u20138, 31\u201346, and 48\u201350 were written and drawn by Byrne. Byrne's She-Hulk stories [[satirized]] comic books and introduced She-Hulk's [[Fourth wall|awareness that she is a comic book character]]. Two issues tested the limits of the [[Comics Code Authority|Comics Code]]: #34 makes reference to the 1991 ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' cover in which actress [[Demi Moore]] appeared nude and pregnant (She-Hulk's version has her holding a green beach ball to imitate Moore's pregnancy). In issue #40, She-Hulk is depicted jumping rope (apparently) [[Nudity|in the nude]], with her [[breast]]s and [[genital area]] covered by blur lines; the cover of the same issue shows her covering herself with a form sporting the lines \"Approved [...] Comics Code\". Other writers to contribute to this series include [[Steve Gerber]] (#10, 11 and 13\u201323), [[Simon Furman]], and [[Peter David]].\n\nDuring ''The Sensational She-Hulk'', the character continued making numerous guest appearances. In 1990, She-Hulk appeared in the two-issue limited series ''She-Hulk: Ceremony''.\n\n''The Sensational She-Hulk'' ran until issue #60 (February 1994), making it the longest-running solo title of any Marvel superheroine up to that point.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bitchmedia.org/article/she-hulk-attorney-at-law-jen-walters-feminism|title=She-Hulk, Attorney at Law: She's Mean, She's Green, and She Believes in Due Process|website=Bitch Media}}</ref> After the cancellation of She-Hulk's second solo series, she continued making backup, one-shot, and team appearances in ''Fantastic Force'' (starting with issue #13 in November 1995), the 1996 miniseries ''[[Doc Samson]]'' #1\u20134 (January\u2013April 1996), ''Heroes for Hire'' #8\u201319 (February 1998 through the series finale in January 1999), and ''The Avengers''. Her next major appearance was in the May 2002 one-shot titled ''Thing and She-Hulk: The Long Night''.\n\nIn May 2004, ''She-Hulk'' was given a new title and launched in a wave of six new Marvel books. Despite favorable critical notices, the new series could not escape the low sales numbers that the titles received from their initial cluster-style launch.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} Marvel brought the series to a close with #12 and promised a re-launch of the title (as a \"second season\") eight months later.<ref>''She-Hulk'' #12</ref> The eight-month gap is alluded to in the body of the story itself.\n\nWith the original creative team ([[Dan Slott]] and Juan Bobillo) from the previous series, the book returned eight months later as promised in October 2005. The third issue was billed as the 100th issue of a She-Hulk comic book, and had story art by numerous artists, including Vosburg. There was no new artwork by Buscema or Byrne, who were represented by reprints of ''The Sensational She-Hulk'' #1 and ''The Savage She-Hulk'' #1.\n\nDan Slott's last issue is #21; with 33 issues, Slott has written the most solo issues of She-Hulk. [[Peter David]] became the new writer with ''She-Hulk'' #22. Marvel Comics announced that ''She-Hulk'' #38 (February 2009) would be the final issue of the series. Peter David commented on his [[blog]] that sales of the book were hurt due to discrepancies between his book and [[Jeph Loeb]]'s ''Hulk'' series, caused by editorial error:\n\n{{blockquote|I didn't even know she WAS going to be in Hulk.

Since no other donors with her [[blood type]] were available, Banner provided his own blood for a transfusion; as they already shared the same blood type and [[DNA]], his gamma-[[Radioactive decay|irradiated]] blood, combined with her anger, transformed Jennifer into the green-skinned She-Hulk when the mobsters tried to finish her off at the hospital.<ref>''The Savage She-Hulk'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> She then used her new powers to take down Trask, who was killed when the earth-boring device he rode malfunctioned, taking him to the center of the Earth.<ref>''The Savage She-Hulk'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nAs She-Hulk, Jennifer possessed [[metahuman|powers]] similar to those of her cousin, though at a reduced level. She also possessed a less monstrous, more [[female body shape|Amazonian]] appearance. Initially, the transformation to her She-Hulk form was triggered (as with Bruce Banner's) by anger. Like her cousin Bruce, his counterpart, the [[Leader (comics)|Leader]], [[Doc Samson]] and most other persons mutated by exposure to gamma radiation over the years, her mutated form was originally explained as being molded by her subconscious desire to look like the ideal woman. She eventually gains control of her transformations when [[Morbius, the Living Vampire|Michael Morbius]] cures her of a lethal blood disease. As a criminal defense lawyer, she defended Morbius in his trial for his vampiric killings, and managed to reduce the conviction to [[involuntary manslaughter]], considering his medical condition.<ref>''The Savage She-Hulk'' #11\u201312. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nEventually, Jennifer decides that she is going to retain her She-Hulk form permanently\u2014preferring the freedom, confidence, and assertiveness that it gave her compared to her more timorous and fragile \"normal\" form. After her brief solo career, she joined the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].<ref>''The Avengers'' #221.

This radiation exposure had a drastic effect on Jennifer: she could no longer transform back into her original human form.<ref>''Marvel Graphic Novel'' #18 - ''The Sensational She-Hulk''. Marvel Comics.</ref> However, this was an agreeable turn of events for her, since she preferred being She-Hulk, and it was revealed much later by Leonard Samson and Reed Richards that the block was purely psychological.\n\nShortly after that, she appeared before the Supreme Court, where she battled Titania again.<ref>''Solo Avengers'' #14. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n===''The Sensational She-Hulk''===\nAfter her Fantastic Four years, She-Hulk rejoined the Avengers for a while.

Marvel Comics.</ref> With Spider-Man, she defeated the Headmen<ref>''The Sensational She-Hulk'' #3</ref> and became an assistant District Attorney and began working for New York City [[district attorney]] Blake Tower.

Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n''The Sensational She-Hulk'' #15 introduced a grey version of She-Hulk that appeared at night only and shared a lot in common with the Hulk, such as having a childlike mind, [[Illeism|speaking in the third person]] and divorcing from her Jennifer Walters identity, referring to Jennifer as \"puny Jennifer\", She-Hulk returned to normal in the following issue, with her green coloration returning in ''The Sensational She-Hulk #17''.<ref>''The Sensational She-Hulk'' #15\u201317. Marvel Comics.</ref> She-Hulk later discovered that Louise Mason had manipulated Tower into hiring her, so that Mason might again star in a comic book (and thus avoid dying of old age). Later, while doing legal work for [[Heroes for Hire]], She-Hulk spent some time dating [[Luke Cage]].\n\nAfter a time, She-Hulk returns to the Avengers. Repeated exposure to the presence of her teammate [[Jack of Hearts (Marvel Comics)|Jack of Hearts]], who has the innate ability to absorb radiation that is around him, leads to She-Hulk being unable to control her changes, which resulted in her tearing the [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]] in half. It is then revealed that all of the events were caused by the [[Scarlet Witch]]. Now, when she is afraid, she not only turns into She-Hulk but her mind becomes maddened by paranoia and rage. Jennifer flees, fearing that she will endanger her friends and others, leading to the \"Search for She-Hulk\" storyline.\n\nThe other Avengers track her to the town of Bone, [[Idaho]], where Jennifer is lying low but the anxiety of being found prompts her to change, causing her to damage much of the town. Her cousin shows up but fails to reason with her; he \"Hulks out\" and the two fight\u2014the devastation to the town subsequently being blamed on the Hulk.\n\nPsychological limitations inhibit her transformation between her two forms. For a time, as detailed in \"She-Hulk\" #4 (March 2006), Jennifer works as a relief volunteer helping to repair Bone. She gains confidence after solving a murder mystery, reveals her green alter-ego to the entire town, and then uses her strength to make many more repairs. This, combined with Leonard Samson's new 'gamma-charger', gives her full control over her transformations for, as she said, 'the time being'.\n\n===''JLA/Avengers''===\nIn the [[DC Comics|DC]]/Marvel crossover ''[[JLA/Avengers]]'', She-Hulk first appears being brainwashed by [[Starro]] when the Avengers battle her, grabbing a startled [[Ms. Marvel]] ([[Carol Danvers]]) by her leg, before the latter blasts her away with her powers.<ref>''JLA/Avengers'' #1.

However, as an attorney, she advised individuals on both sides of the [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]. She agreed to file suit against Peter Parker for fraud on behalf of her father-in-law, ''[[Daily Bugle]]'' publisher [[J. Jonah Jameson]]. Her intention is to keep the suit tied up in the courts indefinitely. She is also the lawyer for [[Robbie Baldwin|Speedball]] in ''[[Civil War: Front Line]]''.\n\nIn ''She-Hulk'' #14 (2006), [[Clay Quartermain]] of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] informs Jennifer that she has been drafted into the organization as a result of her registration.

Jennifer informs Stark that he's miscalculated: She-Hulk would have just pummeled him, but Jennifer Walters has the ability to destroy him.\n\nOn her way home, Jennifer runs into [[Amadeus Cho]], a young genius out looking for friends of the Hulk. Cho, whom the Hulk once saved, discovered what the [[Illuminati (comics)|Illuminati]] had done to the Hulk, and he wants help in finding him. Cho temporarily restores Jennifer's powers so that she can take out Doc Samson, who came to apprehend Cho for [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]] and Tony Stark. Cho says he can permanently restore Jennifer's powers if she will join him, but she politely refuses, instead directing him to [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]] and [[Warren Worthington III|Angel]].\n\nDuring the \"[[World War Hulk]]\" storyline, a re-powered She-Hulk assists in the evacuation of [[Manhattan]].<ref>''World War Hulk'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> She tries to reason with her cousin, who has just destroyed [[Stark Tower]] during his battle with Iron Man. The Hulk warns her to leave, but she stands her ground. After she lands a punch squarely to his face, the Hulk smashes her into the ground, creating a crater around her body. As he moves on to his next confrontation, all Jennifer can say is: \"God help us all.\"<ref>''World War Hulk'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nJennifer is held captive with the other defeated heroes at [[Madison Square Garden]], which the Hulk has converted into a gladiatorial arena. The heroes have been implanted with the same obedience discs that compelled the Hulk and his allies to fight one another during their time on the planet Sakaar.\n\nJennifer returns to the law firm to work on suing Tony Stark for stealing her powers. She is [[subpoena]]ed to give a testimony in a case in which Mallory Book is trying to prove that the [[Leader (comics)|Leader]]'s criminal acts are the result of a shift of personality induced by his mutation, and an addiction to his gamma irradiated powers, and that he thus cannot be held accountable for his actions. During her testimony, Jennifer realizes that she herself is \"addicted\" to being She-Hulk; Mallory forces her to admit that she has had a long list of sexual partners as She-Hulk. After the testimony, Pug appears and the two spend an evening together as friends, which cheers her up. She confronts Mallory the next day and tells her that she will put a stop to her Leader case.<ref>''She-Hulk'' vol. 2 #19. Marvel Comics.</ref> However, it is revealed that the Leader has been acquitted of his crimes.<ref name=autogenerated1>''She-Hulk'' vol. 2 #20. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nThere is an apparent inconsistency between the ''She-Hulk'' and ''World War Hulk'' comics: in ''She-Hulk'' #19, the Leader is on trial in New York City, which is being cleaned up after the Hulk's recent attack. The action in the issue takes place during or after the events of ''World War Hulk''. However, Jennifer appears as She-Hulk in the first and second issues of ''World War Hulk'', during which the Hulk is destroying New York City. The discrepancy is resolved in ''She-Hulk'' #20: Jennifer explains that Tony Stark temporarily disabled the nanobots to allow her to assist in the battle against her cousin, only to reactivate them when the battle was over. She amends her suit against Stark to demand the permanent deactivation of the nanobots.\n\n===Post-''World War Hulk''===\nAt some point after ''World War Hulk'', Jennifer was brought before the [[Living Tribunal]],<ref name=autogenerated1/> and asked to weigh her universe against a newer, better \"cosmic [[trophy wife]]\" version, described by Walters as \"an '''[[Ultimate Marvel|ultimate]]''' universe.\" Her universe wins, and she resigns from the [[Living Tribunal#The Magistrati|Magistrati]].\n\nAfter the Leader's trial, Artie Zix reveals himself as [[Living Tribunal#The Magistrati|RT-Z9]] and holds the main staff of GLK&H hostage while asking them questions at the behest of a group of aliens from a corner of the galaxy recently discovered by the [[Watcher (comics)|Watcher]] Qyre. The aliens, called the Recluses, wish to keep their existence a secret. She-Hulk earlier decreed that Qyre not reveal knowledge of the Recluses' existence at the meetings of the Watchers.<ref>{{cite comic|title=She-Hulk |volume=1 |issue=#7 |date=November 2004}}</ref> This had serious repercussions: it is revealed at the close of ''She-Hulk'' #20 that an evil being has conquered that portion of the galaxy, and is preparing an assault on all of creation. Qyre, who holds knowledge of the plan, is unable to speak of it to anyone else. At She-Hulk's time trial, it was revealed that her actions made a destructive event called the Reckoning War possible. However, comments made by the future [[Southpaw (comics)|Southpaw]], divulge that the war, though a terrible and dark time, will be favorably resolved.\n\nA permanently de-powered Jennifer Walters finds that tourists from an alternate universe&nbsp;\u2013 designated the Alpha universe&nbsp;\u2013 are crossing into her universe&nbsp;\u2013 which they call Beta&nbsp;\u2013 to gain access to superpowers and comes face to face with her own powered-up doppelganger. Jennifer confirms that her Alpha counterpart slept with the [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]] but her anger quickly turns to sorrow as she realizes that without her abilities, the Alpha Jennifer Walters&nbsp;\u2013 while unfamiliar with superhuman law&nbsp;\u2013 is far better suited to life in the Beta universe. Realizing this, she decides that she will go to the Alpha universe and let the other Jennifer Walters take over for her.\n\nAs she steps through the portal, Reed Richards realizes he can use the previously stored configuration of the Alpha She-Hulk to restore Jennifer's powers by purging the nanites from her body and setting the teleporter to loop her back to this reality. Having regained her abilities, Jennifer remains in her home reality, while the Alpha Jen Walters returns to her own universe and reconciles with her boyfriend, the Alpha Augustus \"Pug\" Pugliese.\n\nAt an unspecified time after ''World War Hulk'', She-Hulk assists [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]] with [[Abomination (comics)|Emil Blonsky]]'s murder investigation.<ref name=\"Hulk' #1 2008\">{{cite comic|title=Hulk |issue=#1 |date=2008}}</ref> While in Stark's Helicarrier, she is attacked and beaten by the [[Red Hulk]] who states to her that he's not Bruce.

While she was successful in defending him, immediately after his freedom was secured he claimed to be guilty and showed her images of the crimes he had been accused of. Jennifer's horror at what she was being shown, combined with Moore's gloating, was enough to push her rage so far that she became the savage She-Hulk once again. She attacked him and threatened to kill him if he was not given the death penalty. She also told everybody within earshot that he was guilty and backed up her accusation by revealing [[Attorney\u2013client privilege|privileged information]]. This resulted in her being [[Disbarment|disbarred]]. Jennifer later found out that Moore really ''was'' innocent; the images he had shown her had been false. It was also revealed, albeit not to Jennifer, that Moore had hoped to get her to react exactly the way she did since his employers wanted She-Hulk disbarred for purposes as yet unknown. Unable to practice law any more, Jennifer began working for Freeman Bonds Inc.&nbsp;\u2013 a subsidiary of GLK&B&nbsp;\u2013 as a bounty hunter with her [[Skrull]] partner [[Jazinda]].\n\nShe was later recruited by Stark as a member of an [[Fifty State Initiative|Initiative]]-sponsored incarnation of the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]] for a short while until Tony Stark disbanded the team.<ref>''The Last Defenders'': May\u2013October 2008.

[[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]] initially impedes her progress, but they part ways on uncertain terms. She-Hulk and Jazinda capture the Skrull and the two heroines take the Skrull to New York, where they encounter the [[Super-Skrull]], Kl'rt.<ref>''She-Hulk'' vol. 2 #32. Marvel Comics.</ref> Kl'rt came to kill his daughter, Jazinda, going so far as to shoot her in the head. Due to her regenerative properties, Jazinda was still not fully dead. The Skrull religious leader wants to completely remove her regenerative ability, but Kl'rt stops him after She-Hulk pleads to his fatherly nature, tapping into his guilt for not being able to save his son who had died in a previous war.{{Issue|date=July 2010}}\n\n===Lady Liberators===\nSome time after the Skrull invasion is defeated, the country of Marinmer suffers a devastating earthquake. Because the victims of the earthquake are members of a minority religious group, the Marinmer government has confiscated all humanitarian aid packages, and because of Marinmer's strong ties to powerful countries such as Russia and China, other nations refuse to intervene for fear of sparking a war. She-Hulk and several members of the [[Lady Liberators]] secretly enter Marinmer, intending to steal the confiscated aid packages and distribute them to the earthquake victims.<ref>''She-Hulk'' vol. 2 #34. Marvel Comics.</ref> The [[Winter Guard]] attempts to stop them, but gives up after seeing the plight of the earthquake victims.<ref>''She-Hulk'' vol. 2 #35. Marvel Comics.</ref> Afterwards, the US government attempts to arrest She-Hulk for her actions in Marinmer, but drops the charges to avoid political embarrassment. With public opinion overwhelmingly in her favor, She-Hulk seems poised to get her legal license back when Jazinda is captured by the Behemoth after he mistakenly attacks her, thinking she is the real She-Hulk.<ref>''She-Hulk'' vol. 2 #36\u201337. Marvel Comics.</ref> Jazinda is then taken to a government lab and brutally experimented on when her ability to resurrect herself from the dead is discovered. Jazinda contacts She-Hulk telepathically through a secretly implanted mind reading device and warns her that the government will be coming to question her about their relationship. Jazinda tells She-Hulk to say she did not know Jazinda was a Skrull and just before going dead/unconscious tells She-Hulk \"I've always l...\". She-Hulk tries to keep up the denial, but when she sees Jazinda about to be vivisected, she loses control and breaks Jazinda out. The Behemoth tries to stop her, but She-Hulk defeats him with the help of the Lady Liberators. Later it is revealed that Mallory Book, her former boss, was behind all the bad things happening to She-Hulk along with a group called the \"Fourth Wall\". Yet when she saw She-Hulk risk herself to save her Skrull friend, Book \"cancelled\" the plan.<ref>''She-Hulk'' vol. 2 #38.

She informs him that she is unable to as she has asked too many questions to the wrong people. She has Urich bring a photographer (Peter Parker), and meets him along with her insider, Doc Samson, and they venture into a S.H.I.E.L.D. base that is actually a front for [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]] and General Ross's Gamma Power Super Soldier Program. Leonard Samson then appears to have a breakdown, but in reality he is changing into Samson. Samson claims to be stronger and faster (and is larger in size, has longer hair and a lightning bolt scar) than Jennifer. The clashing duo are subdued by [[MODOK]] and the facility explodes in the aftermath of a fight between Red Hulk and Hulk; Jennifer, Samson (who has reverted to Leonard) and Red Hulk are caught in the explosion. Jennifer's status is unknown and Red Hulk does not reveal anything to Urich when the two meet a second time.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #600.

During this battle, Red She-Hulk brutally beat Jennifer and snapped her neck with a cable. In the last panel, Jennifer Walters appeared to be dead with the Red She-Hulk standing over her body,<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' 606. Marvel Comics.</ref> though the Red She-Hulk claims she did not know her own strength.

She-Hulk is on the team as they manage to successfully avert disaster. Upon returning to Earth, they find the world in flames as it is in the grasp of the Chaos War. They journey to Hell, where they fight and defeat the Chaos King. Returning to a restored Earth, they are greeted as monsters.{{Issue|date=February 2011}}\n\nAt some point before or after these events, Jennifer and [[She-Hulk (Lyra)|Lyra]] settle in New York, where Lyra begins to attend high school in an attempt to gain an understanding of humanity as it occurs in this timeline.

The rest of the pupils turn on Lyra as a result of her prom date being injured and the endangerment of everyone at the dance. She-Hulk explains to her afterwards that they have to leave and that despite being heroes, the life of a Hulk is often lonely.{{Issue|date=February 2011}}\n\n===Fearsome Four===\nDuring the ''[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]'' storyline, She-Hulk joins with [[Howard the Duck]], [[Nighthawk (Marvel Comics)|Nighthawk]] and the [[Frankenstein's Monster (Marvel Comics)|Frankenstein Monster]] to form a four-person team called the Fearsome Four to stop the [[Man-Thing]] from its destructive path.

Steve Rogers attempts to order the Hulk to stop before he goes after She-Hulk,<ref>''Hulk'' vol. 3 #14. Marvel Comics.</ref> but when Doc Green finally confronts her, he instead admits that he has come to recognize that he is coming dangerously close to the [[Maestro (comics)|Maestro]], as part of him enjoyed eliminating his 'rivals', having decided instead to accept the eventual loss of his intellect as Extremis wore off rather than risk that persona emerging. Informing She-Hulk that she is the only gamma mutation whose life he felt had been legitimately enhanced by her condition, Doc Green provides her with the last injection of his cure, asking her to use it on him if he goes too far in his efforts to stop an A.I. version of himself that he created and unleashed.<ref>''Hulk'' vol. 3 #16.

Due to the stress following the fight with Thanos, Jennifer started turning uncontrollably into her version of the Grey Hulk at different intervals. Jennifer helped Maise when she was recovering from the trauma and being evicted by her landlord Mr. Tick. When Maise got impatient with Jennifer and summoned a Fear Golem that killed Mr. Tick and some police officers, Jennifer is nearly killed by it and transforms into the Hulk. She defeated the Fear Golem and prevented Maise from committing suicide when Maise was arrested for reckless endangerment afterwards.<ref>''Hulk'' vol. 4 #1\u20136. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nAfterwards, Jennifer transformed into the Hulk and met the [[Hellcat (comics)|Hellcat]]. After changing back, Jennifer told the Hellcat that she was worried over the fact that her grey color could mean that she is like Bruce (since Bruce also had a grey incarnation). Later, Jennifer was watching a live video on the internet when a baker named Oliver turned into a Hulk-like creature on-camera.<ref>''Hulk'' vol. 4 #7. Marvel Comics.</ref> Jennifer spent several days trying to track him down, eventually confronting him as the Hulk at the Brooklyn Bridge. During the following battle, she lost control of her Hulk persona, almost killing him, though the Hellcat managed to calm her down. However, the incident left Jennifer worried about losing control again.<ref>''Hulk'' vol. 4 #8\u201310. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nSome time later, the Leader kidnapped Jennifer and forced her to transform into the Hulk in order to force her to kill his new assistant, Robyn, who willingly went through a blood transfusion in order to become a Hulk-like monster herself. The Hulk nearly killed Robyn, but Jennifer managed to regain control, before defeating the Leader by electrocuting him. Jen then went with self-help writer Florida Mayer, who used a special pill to transport Jennifer to her subconscious, leading her to confront her Hulk persona and illusions of Thanos and Banner, finally overcoming her trauma in the process.

In addition the character possesses superhuman speed, agility, stamina, and reflexes.<ref>''The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Master Edition'' #6 (1991). Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nAs She-Hulk, Walters is exponentially stronger than she is in her Jennifer Walters form; therefore any extra strength gained as Jennifer Walters through intense physical training will be amplified, making her She-Hulk form even stronger. After being defeated by the [[Champion of the Universe]], She-Hulk exercised for several months in her Jennifer Walters form, resulting in a significant gain in strength and [[muscle|muscular mass]] in her She-Hulk form and allowing her to soundly defeat the Champion in a rematch. At this time she was able to effortlessly sustain the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]]'s maximum weight with a single arm, while her strength was greatly restrained by a \"Jupiter suit,\" and she was shown as considerably stronger than [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]].<ref name=\"Champion&Herc\"/> Similarly to her cousin, her powers can also greatly increase by absorbing radiation.<ref>{{cite comic|title=Incredible Hulks |issue=#635 |date=2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite comic|title=Mighty Avengers |issue=9 |date=April 2014}}</ref> She is capable of absorbing great amounts of energy, and used this ability to absorb the uncontrolled energy of the new Starbrand.<ref>''Avengers'' #30 (2018).

Even in her Jennifer Walters form, she possesses sufficient skill in the [[martial arts]] to dispatch several would-be muggers much larger than she is. She once displayed sufficient knowledge of [[acupressure]] to render the [[Abomination (comics)|Abomination]] insensate by striking several nerve clusters after first using psychology to distract him.<ref>{{cite comic|title=She-Hulk |volume=4 |issue=#15 |date=2007}}</ref>\n\nShe-Hulk is also a skilled and experienced attorney who attended the [[UCLA School of Law]], where she was a member of the [[Order of the Coif]], a national merit society for top legal scholars.

In some stories, she showed an awareness of being a comic book character, with visuals of her \"tearing the page\" or \"walking through a page of advertisements\" to reach an enemy's control center. She sometimes engaged in arguments with the writer ([[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]]), or appealed to the comic's editor, [[Ren\u00e9e Witterstaetter]]. ''The Sensational She-Hulk'' #50 (Byrne's last issue) involved Ren\u00e9e locking a bound-and-gagged Byrne in a storage closet while she and Jen tried to find the book's new writer. This trend was briefly carried on during her tenure with the [[Heroes for Hire]], when she \"spoke\" to the book's narrator and \"fired\" him for losing the plot. Other Marvel characters that have been written to directly \"address\" the audience include She-Hulk's friend [[Blonde Phantom|Louise Mason]], [[Uatu the Watcher]] (who narrates a majority of the issues of ''What If'' by speaking directly to the reader), and [[Deadpool]]. On occasion, this practice has also been used for [[Loki (Marvel Comics)|Loki]], [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]], [[Wyatt Wingfoot]], and [[Howard the Duck]]. The latest series has not acknowledged this primarily-humor-based quirk of She-Hulk's, save for a coda in vol. 2 #3 (#100), in which Stu Cicero, a law firm \"researcher\" asks Jen if she can \"really do stuff like that.\" She somewhat wistfully replies \"No. I can't\" \u2013 however, the panel is drawn at a somewhat ambiguous angle that suggests She-Hulk may be looking \"out\" of the comic at the reader. She-Hulk's most recent profile in the [[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe]] continues to list this \"ability\" of hers, and confirms that she is simply downplaying it for the benefit of those around her.<ref name=\"Gamma Files\"/>\n\nThe Dan Slott series took a different approach to the [[metafiction]] angle, making use of a concept dating back to Lee and Kirby's early ''Fantastic Four'' \u2013 that the heroes of the Marvel Universe permit licensed comic-book adaptations of their adventures to be published. Since all comics published before 2001 bear the seal of the [[Comics Code Authority]] of America (a federal agency in the Marvel Universe), they are considered legal documents admissible as evidence in the superhuman law cases on which She-Hulk works.\n\nIf She-Hulk defeats [[Deadpool]] as the final opponent in ''[[Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds]]'', she will say \"You know, if this game were made in 1991, I'd be the one whacking YOU with a health bar.\" This references Deadpool's fourth wall-breaking hyper move, where he attacks the opponent with his own life bar, as well as the character's rise in popularity in recent years. In the game's update ''[[Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3]]'', if Deadpool is her first opponent, before the match starts she will claim that she can break the fourth wall as well. If she defeats him as her last opponent, She-Hulk will threaten to beat him in ''Marvel vs. Capcom 4'' if the game is ever made.\n\n===Relationships===\nShe-Hulk's relationships with men have been defined by her dual needs for independence and acceptance. These needs were evident in her often-tempestuous relationship with her father, Sheriff Morris Walters. A widower whose wife had been killed by mobsters, Walters was overprotective, controlling, and judgmental. In response, Jennifer sought independence from her father, while also desiring his acceptance.\n\nSheriff Walters felt that the best way for Jennifer to live was for her to follow his values. However, Jennifer grew up perceiving the gray areas of law enforcement (for example, she interpreted the events leading up to riots which occurred during her childhood differently from her father). Although Jennifer saw her decision to become a criminal defense attorney as a kind of homage to her father, Sheriff Walters instead interpreted her choice (to defend criminals) as a rejection of his values.\n\nJennifer worked at nurturing a supportive relationship with her father, and remained close to a childhood friend, Zapper, with whom she ultimately became romantically involved. Being She-Hulk allowed Jennifer to express emotions which she was not otherwise comfortable revealing. For example, although Jennifer Walters was restrained from dating a younger man, as She-Hulk she felt free to express her affection for Zapper. During that same time, Jennifer pursued a problematic relationship with the affable ne'er-do-well [[Richard Rory]] (a supporting character created by [[Steve Gerber]] for the [[Man-Thing]] stories), who actually valued her for who she really was.\n\nUltimately, She-Hulk's relationship with Zapper fell apart, primarily due to her insistence on permanently remaining in her She-Hulk form, eschewing the Jennifer Walters persona that Zapper had grown up with. Zapper believed that Jennifer's preference represented a rejection of the character's true self. Although in actuality She-Hulk liberated much of Jennifer Walters' repressed personality, the She-Hulk persona also repressed certain aspects of Jennifer Walters' personality which She-Hulk found distasteful.\n\nDuring her time as an Avenger, She-Hulk engaged in a relationship with [[Starfox (comics)|Starfox]].<ref>{{cite comic|title=Avengers |issue=#234 |date=August 1983}}</ref> However, this encounter was later retold in flashback,<ref>{{cite comic|title=She-Hulk |volume=4 |issue=#7 |date=June 2006}}</ref> and in that storyline, Starfox was on trial, charged with sexually assaulting a married woman. The alleged victim testified that Starfox's euphoria power had forced her to be sexually forward, similarly to She-Hulk's own encounter with Starfox. Jennifer assumed that her interaction with Starfox had not been consensual after hearing this testimony, but she later discovered that he had not used his powers on her.\n\nIt was also during her Avengers tenure that she met and became fast friends with her teammate [[Wasp (comics)|Janet van Dyne]], who would become a huge influence on She-Hulk's personal development by encouraging her to adopt a more free-going lifestyle, and even help her in times of need.<ref>{{cite comic|title=Sensational She-Hulk |issue=#2 |date=June 1989}}</ref> When the Wasp was temporarily killed by the [[Wrecking Crew (comics)|Wrecking Crew]] during the first [[Secret Wars|Secret War]], She-Hulk impulsively stormed off to avenge her, only to nearly fall victim herself to the Wrecking Crew, the [[Absorbing Man]], [[Titania (Marvel Comics)|Titania]] and [[Doctor Octopus]].<ref>''Secret Wars'' #7\u20138 (November\u2013December 1985)</ref>\n\nShe-Hulk was briefly engaged to the younger [[Wyatt Wingfoot]], whom she first met during her tenure with the Fantastic Four.<ref>{{cite comic|title=Fantastic Four |issue=#269 |date=August 1984}}</ref> She let her guard down with Wyatt, expressing her vulnerabilities as Wyatt supported her during a series of traumatic events. A paparazzo took photos of her sunbathing topless (but nobody ultimately knew it was She-Hulk due to an unwitting editor 'correcting' her green skin).<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #275</ref> Later, corrupt agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. forced her to strip naked and be medically examined as a \"potential threat like her cousin\". This was all filmed for personal arousal purposes, before [[Dum Dum Dugan]] put a stop to the harassment.<ref>''Marvel Graphic Novel'' #18 - ''The Sensational She-Hulk''</ref> Although She-Hulk put forward a brave exterior during those incidents, she was actually quite shaken and appreciated Wyatt's support.\n\nAlthough She-Hulk deeply values close emotional ties with family, friends, and lovers, she seldom admits the depth of her need for these attachments. For example, years after her mother died, Jennifer could not move on from the family home. Even when her father moved out, Jennifer would not leave her family memories behind. The Avengers and Fantastic Four became surrogate families for her; she forged strong bonds with them.\n\nShe-Hulk was married to [[John Jameson (comics)|John Jameson]], whom she first met while he was the Man-Wolf in a Microverse adventure in ''The Savage She-Hulk''. The two precipitously eloped in Las Vegas.<ref>''She-Hulk'' vol. 4 #9</ref> The two shared an apartment with She-Hulk's colleague, Augustus \"Pug\" Pugliese, who holds an unspoken (but obvious) crush on her. Pug correctly deduced that both the suddenness of She-Hulk's strengthened feelings for Jameson, as well as the pair's marriage, were the result of manipulation by Starfox. Due to his efforts to prove this, She-Hulk and John became aware of Pug's crush just as John was forced to become the Man-Wolf once more.\n\nShe-Hulk's passion for John has cooled since Starfox's \"love zap\" was removed. However, John was never zapped, and his deep love for Jennifer Walters has been confirmed (John has stated a preference for She-Hulk in her human form). She-Hulk's reaction to John as the Man-Wolf/the Stargod has not been positive. The marriage has been annulled.\n\nShe-Hulk had a date with [[Luke Cage|Power Man]] while both were on the Heroes for Hire team. She resisted dating an \"ex-con\", but after a scuffle with Titania and the [[Absorbing Man]] where Cage aided her, she reconsidered. The relationship never developed, but a friendship between them was formed.\n\nAfter Jennifer broke up with John Jameson (but before he signed the annulment) she had flings with [[Clay Quartermain]] and [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]], and even made a pass at [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]]. Wolverine rebuffs her, saying he has no wish to \"chase after [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]]'s [[wikt:sloppy seconds|sloppy seconds]].\" She-Hulk repeatedly vehemently denies sleeping with the Juggernaut (as a wanted criminal who has attempted to murder her cousin), despite the two previously being shown in bed together.<ref>{{cite comic|title=The Uncanny X-Men |issue=#435 |date=2003}}</ref> It is revealed that the Juggernaut had, in fact, bedded a She-Hulk from an [[Earth-A|alternate universe]].<ref>''She-Hulk'' vol. 4 #21. Marvel Comics.</ref> An [[Continuity (fiction)|out of continuity]] [[tongue-in-cheek]] mini-chapter later spoofs this, by jokingly showing the two characters as passionately in love.<ref>''She-Hulk'' vol. 4 #25. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nPerhaps her longest crush is on [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]], about whom she has repeatedly dreamt. However, after fighting demons together, she rebuffs Hercules' advances, seeing him as a muscle-bound oaf. After Hercules jovially smacks her bottom, She-Hulk sends him through a brick wall, and says she will relegate the idea of a relationship with him to fantasy, as she finds the reality disappointing.<ref>''She-Hulk'' vol. 2 #25</ref> Despite this, years afterwards they eventually sleep together.<ref>{{cite comic|title=She-Hulk |volume=4 |issue=#30 |date=August 2008}}</ref>\n\nShe-Hulk has many friends in the superhuman community, most of whom showed up for her Christmas party in the 2015 ''Gwenpool Special''.<ref>''Gwenpool Special'' #1 (February 2015). Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n===Costumes===\nDue to her affiliation with different [[List of superhero teams and groups|supergroups]] over the years, She-Hulk has donned numerous [[costume]]s. She-Hulk's personality has also gone through significant changes: from aggressive and short-tempered to intelligent, free-spirited, and vivacious.\n\nBecause of her various outfit changes, no single costume can be considered [[Secular icon|iconic]] (compared to [[Superman]]'s blue and red tights, or [[Spider-Man]]'s red and blue costume and [[mask]]). However, She-Hulk is immediately recognizable due to her size, green skin, and long, dark green, almost black hair.\n\nIn her first appearance, She-Hulk was a massive, towering figure, with wild, untamed, waist-length [[hair]]. She wore a ragged white dress or blouse (the dress ripping and tearing as Walters turned into her giant [[alter ego]]). That white garment, which was often only the blouse that Walters had on before her transformation, always covered her upper body and midsection (in the same way that enough of the Hulk's pants survived to cover him after his transformations). When she was asked about this in an early issue of the second series, Jennifer responded that her clothes carry the label of the [[Comics Code]].\n\nAfter her ''Savage'' era, She-Hulk wore appropriately sized clothes. For instance, she joined the Avengers and began dressing in a one-piece [[aerobics]] outfit. During the Avengers era, she wore a purple, one-piece [[swimsuit]] with a white belt and boots.\n\nAfter the first of the Secret Wars, She-Hulk took the place of the Thing and became a full-fledged member of the [[Fantastic Four]]. Her costume kept the sleeveless/legless leotard design, incorporating the colors and style of the team's costumes, with a \"4\" prominently displayed across her chest and white gloves and boots. After leaving the Fantastic Four, she rejoined the Avengers, donning a white one-piece costume with the blue Avengers insignia emblazoned on it.\n\nShe-Hulk has then worn a purple and white one-piece [[leotard]], complemented by fingerless gloves and sneakers. Her hair is long and straight, as opposed to the thick, curly tresses she sported in the past. After the events of World War Hulk, she has added baggy low-rise jeans to this look.\n\n==Reception==\n\n=== Critical reception ===\nJenna Anderson of ''[[Comicbook.com]]'' stated, \"Although she has had a slew of different comic interpretations over the years, [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]]'s take on her in ''The Sensational She-Hulk'' is often regarded as the most iconic -- both for further developing her as a character, and for satirizing the comic book tropes of the time. In the decades since, She-Hulk has consistently remained spirited and feisty, but also incredibly intelligent, empathetic, and altruistic, both in her life as a superhero and as a lawyer.\"<ref>{{Cite web |title=She-Hulk: Why Tatiana Maslany Is Perfect for Jennifer Walters |url=https://comicbook.com/tv-shows/news/she-hulk-marvel-cinematic-universe-disney-plus-tatiana-maslany-cast/ |access-date=2022-08-19 |website=TV Shows |language=en}}</ref> Chris Arrant of ''[[Newsarama]]'' said, \"From the novel idea of a lawyer specializing in superhero law to a successful businesswoman dealing with the realities (and fiction) of controlling (or not controlling) her anger issues, She-Hulk isn't a clich\u00e9 or an archetype, which makes her one of top characters in the Marvel U.<ref name=\"GamesRadar\">{{Cite web |author1=Chris Arrant Contributions from Michael Doran |date=2022-05-25 |title=The best Marvel characters of all time ranked |url=https://www.gamesradar.com/marvel-characters/ |access-date=2022-08-19 |website=gamesradar |language=en}}</ref> ''[[IGN]]'' wrote, \"Plenty of heroes have gained female sidekicks over the years, but few of these ladies have so capably managed to escape the shadow of their namesakes as She-Hulk.
