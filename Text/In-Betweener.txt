After an encounter with the sorcerer [[Doctor Strange]], the In-Betweener is imprisoned as punishment for rebelling against his masters.<ref>''Doctor Strange'' vol. 2 #26-28 (Dec. 1977-April 1978 [bi-monthly])</ref> \n\nThe In-Betweener later attempts to supplant Galactus' role in the universe and allies with the [[Elders of the Universe]] in their plan against Galactus. However, the In-Betweener betrays the Elders during a confrontation with the entity [[Death (Marvel Comics)|Death]] and compels Death to wipe three of the Elders from existence.<ref>''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3 #17 (Nov. 1988)</ref> Soon after this, the In-Betweener also battles Galactus and his robotic servant the [[Punisher (Galactus)|Punisher]], but the stalemated battle is interrupted by his masters, who subsequently imprison him.<ref name=\"Silver Surfer' 1988\"/>\n\nHe is later freed by Thanos, who secretly desires the Soul Gem the In-Betweener wears, as it is one of the six [[Infinity Gems]]. Thanos then steals the gem and abandons the In-Betweener to face the wrath of Master Order and Lord Chaos, who discover he has escaped his prison.<ref name=\"Thanos Quest #1 1990\"/>\n\nThe In-Betweener later appeared as a pawn of the villain [[Scorpio (Marvel Comics)|Scorpio]], who is a member of the criminal organization [[Zodiac (comics)|Zodiac]]. Scorpio, however, was stopped by the superhero team the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and the In-Betweener was subsequently freed.<ref>''The Avengers'' vol. 3 #58-60 (June-Aug. 2002)</ref>\n\nThe In-Betweener also appeared in an alternate dimension of [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)#Confirmed Designated Earths and Alternate Planes of Existence|Earth-957]].<ref>''What If?'' vol. 2 #75 (July 1995)</ref>\n\nDuring the ''[[Time Runs Out]]'' storyline, the [[Beyonders]] are revealed to have killed Master Order, Lord Chaos and the In-Betweener as part of destroying abstract entities in each reality across the multiverse.<ref>''New Avengers'' vol. 3 #30 (April 2015)</ref> However, the In-Betweener was later revealed to be the mastermind behind [[Libra (Marvel Comics)|Libra]]'s attempt at destroying Earth, and more specifically, [[Star Brand|Starbrand]].<ref>''Starbrand & Nightmask'' #4 (March 2016)</ref>\n\nNot long after the universe was restored, Master Order and Lord Chaos took advantage of the fact that the cosmic hierarchy was not set anew and apparently kill the Living Tribunal. After committing the murder, they approached the In-Betweener and forced him to become the binding force that combined Master Order and Lord Chaos into a new cosmic being named Logos in order to take the Living Tribunal's place as the personification of multiversal law.<ref>''The Ultimates 2'' #3</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nAs the physical embodiment of the cosmic balance between Order and Chaos, the In-Betweener is able to manipulate cosmic energy to alter reality to achieve nearly any effect or ability within his influence as the synthesis of duality. He is, however, under the absolute control of Master Order and Lord Chaos as his creators. The In-Betweener's other major (and unique) ability is to analyze a target and then direct energy towards it in a \"polar opposite\" form, which is instantly fatal.<ref name=\"Silver Surfer' 1988\"/> \n\nAlternatively, if he cannot personally synthesize the \"opposite energy\" necessary to eliminate an opponent, he can directly summon that enemy's opposite being, and eliminate them that way; using the power granted to him in his station as a cosmic force, he once even summoned and forced Death itself to destroy the [[Elders of the Universe]], even though it had, at an earlier point, refused to ever let them die again as a punishment. The In-Betweener finds that he is unable to use either of his special abilities on Galactus, however, and he believes that this is because ''he'' is Galactus's metaphysical counterpart and opposite.<ref>''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3 #17 (Nov. 1988)</ref>\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==External links==\n* [http://marvel.com/universe/In-Betweener In-Betweener] at Marvel.com\n* {{Marveldatabase}}\n\n{{Marvel Cosmic Entities}}\n{{Jim Starlin}}\n\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1974]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Jim Starlin]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]"}]}}}}
