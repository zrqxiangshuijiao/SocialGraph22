She wasn't pregnant then. How could she be eight months pregnant now?\"</ref>\n\nClaremont wrote a follow up to the Marcus story in ''The Avengers'' Annual #10 (1981).

Sure, there's a Captain America in the corner, and a Bucky here and there, but mostly, these fans are dressed as a different Captain: Carol Danvers, who in 2012 became Captain Marvel. And this is Carol Corps. [...] In the larger and significantly male-dominated climate of superhero fandom, the Carol Corps is a notable exception. The majority of the 300 fans milling around the museum are female; in fact, the Corps' central rallying points\u2014crafting and cosplay\u2014are both more traditionally feminine areas of fandom. [...]  In the last two years, they've raised thousands of dollars for girls' leadership initiatives. A loosely organized group called the \"yarn brigade\" sends Captain Marvel-inspired knitwear to any fan in need of comfort or warmth.

On the surface, they look like any other devout fandom: They worship the character of Carol Danvers and cosplay as her space commander alter ego. But the Carol Corps, DeConnick, and the character they love are also pushing back against a history of the comic book industry neglecting some of its characters, its readers, and the very women who make comic books. Ultimately, this fandom is more than fidelity for a character \u2014 it\u2019s about the journey Danvers has taken to become a central figure in Marvel\u2019s crowded comic book universe and about DeConnick\u2019s spirit to push for something more for the character, for herself as a creator, and for fans.

Indeed, progressive Captain Marvel fandom has become such a cultural force that we here at Vulture held a whole New York Comic-Con panel about Carol Corps and the rise in female comics fandom that has accompanied it. We had one of the bigger halls at the convention, and Captain Marvel fans filled the entire space. Carol is an extremely fun character: She was trained in the Air Force, has a ''Star Wars'' obsession, is very protective of her cat, is more tough than intellectual, and generally struggles to live up to the Captain Marvels that have come before her.

It was finally safe to set up my own pull list. For the most part, I was right. As an industry and a fandom, comics still has a lot of problems \u2014 but overall it\u2019s far more friendly to women, especially white women, than it was prior to that moment. It wasn\u2019t all Carol and Kelly Sue, of course. Books like ''Nimona, Lumberjanes'', ''Giant Days, Gotham Academy'', ''DC Bombshells'', and the new''Ms. Marvel'' helped usher in an era driven by young female characters in strong stories. That doesn\u2019t even touch on web comics or manga that are even more popular with female readers. The comics industry appeals to a much broader demographic than the stereotypes would have you believe, and the Carol Corps were a part of that. At the height of the group\u2019s popularity and engagement, it felt like the Carol Corps was everywhere. Tumblr was full of posts sharing favorite panels and cosplay guides, fans were showing up in costume at conventions and marathons and on issue covers.

And while Carol\u2019s character outfit hasn\u2019t really changed, her physical form, in a slight departure from previous portrayals, is more muscular and impressive than ever. Captain Marvel is literally a super strong woman now, which is a nice and bold direction for a comic to take. I have always thought that there is a slight disconnect in the art when a female character is supposed to be super strong but still sports a slender physique \u2013 Thor and She-Hulk, however, have also recently been getting some more muscles, so maybe that trend is on the outs. Overall, ''Captain Marvel'' fans should have nothing to worry about in this new beginning. Carol is still Carol, and it looks like this new creative team has no shortage of ideas for stories and ways to test what really makes this woman Captain Marvel.

It is both an improvement and a solid standard for superhero comics aimed at capturing those just learning to read any media.\"<ref>{{Cite web |title=Comic Book Reviews for This Week: 9/19/2018 |url=https://comicbook.com/comics/news/comic-book-reviews-marvel-dc-image/ |access-date=2022-09-11 |website=Comics |language=en}}</ref>\n\n==== ''Captain Marvel'' - 2019 ====\nAccording to [[Diamond Comic Distributors]], ''Captain Marvel'' #1 was the 2nd best selling comic book in January 2019.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Top 100 Comics: January 2019 |url=http://www.diamondcomics.com/Article/226526-Top-100-Comics-January-2019 |access-date=2022-09-11 |website=www.diamondcomics.com |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Comichron: January 2019 Comic Book Sales to Comics Shops |url=https://www.comichron.com/monthlycomicssales/2019/2019-01.html |access-date=2022-09-11 |website=www.comichron.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Top 500 Comics--January 2019 |url=https://icv2.com/articles/markets/view/42557/top-500-comics-january-2019 |access-date=2022-09-11 |website=icv2.com |language=en}}</ref> ''Captain Marvel'' #1 was the 26th best selling comic book in 2019.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Top 500 Comics: Year 2019 |url=http://www.diamondcomics.com/Article/238979-Top-500-Comics-Year-2019 |access-date=2022-09-11 |website=www.diamondcomics.com |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Comichron: 2019 Comic Book Sales to Comics Shops |url=https://www.comichron.com/monthlycomicssales/2019.html |access-date=2022-09-11 |website=www.comichron.com}}</ref>\n\nMike Fugere of ''[[CBR.com]]'' described ''Captain Marvel'' #1 as a \"solid groundwork for something with the potential to be really special,\" stating, \"''Captain Marvel'' #1 may not be the most complex and thrilling debut Carol Danvers has ever starred in, but it\u2019s a lot of fun.

Thompson and company's Captain Marvel brings all the elements you loved about Carol and adds a few new wrinkles of her own. That would be enough to win us over, but then she goes and turns the book on its head by issue's end, paving a new path that holds even more compelling possibilities for our favorite hero.
