He is a charter member of the [[Warriors Three]], a trio of [[Asgard (comics)|Asgardian]] adventurers consisting of Fandral, [[Hogun]] the Grim, and [[Volstagg]] the Valiant. They are members of the supporting cast in Marvel's [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] comics and usually provide comic relief and side-adventures.\n\nIn the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]], Fandral was portrayed by [[Josh Dallas]] in ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]'' (2011) and by [[Zachary Levi]] in ''[[Thor: The Dark World]]'' (2013) and ''[[Thor: Ragnarok]]'' (2017).\n\n==Publication history==\n{{expand section|date=June 2014}}\nFandral first appeared in ''[[Journey into Mystery]]'' #119 (August, 1965), and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]].\n\nWriter [[Stan Lee]] based Fandral on the public persona of actor [[Errol Flynn]].<ref name=\"Errol\">Cooke, Jon B.

He is an irrepressible swashbuckler and romantic. His bravery and optimism often puts the group in highly disadvantageous positions; as perennially pointed out by the gloomy [[Hogun]]. Fandral considers himself the consummate ladies' man and is often depicted with a bevy of young ladies. His actual success with these ladies is intermittent at best, but as such provides numerous opportunities for humorous results. Despite these flaws, he possesses an excessively noble spirit and will do the right thing without thought to his personal safety or prosperity.\n\nFandral has been involved in a great many adventures and quests, as a member of the [[Warriors Three]], as an ally of [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], and on his own. Fandral joined in a quest for the power that had cracked the Oversword of Asgard.<ref>''Journey into Mystery'' #119 (Aug. 1965)</ref> He helped quell a mutiny led by [[Loki (Marvel Comics)|Loki]], despite Loki having been the one to hire Fandral onto the Oversword quest in the first place.<ref name=\"jim122\">''Journey into Mystery'' #122 (Nov. 1965)</ref> He helped repel an attack of the Flying Trolls of Thryheim.<ref name=\"jim124125\">''Journey into Mystery'' #124-125 (Jan.-Feb. 1966)</ref> He helped defeat the forces of Harokin.

Like all Asgardians, he possesses superhuman strength, speed, agility, stamina, and durability.\n\nFandral is a master swordsman, and excellent overall battlefield warrior. He is highly proficient in the use of all edged weapons, and his superhuman dexterity, speed, and agility are all significantly greater than the average Asgardian male. Thor himself refers to Fandral as \"the best of us with the blade\".<ref name=\"thorbo\"/> Like all Asgardians, Fandral's bone, skin and muscle are roughly 3 times denser than a typical human, giving him an extremely high resistance to injury and superhuman strength.\n\nFandral rides a horse named Firehooves. He can also use the Asgardian Starjammer for transportation.\n\n==Other versions==\nIn the ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (1969 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' timeline, Fandral is still alive and well in the 31st Century.<ref name=\"gotg42\">''Guardians of the Galaxy'' #42 (Nov. 1993).
