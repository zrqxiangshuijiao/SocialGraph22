A scientist researching [[robotics]] and [[Arachnid|arachnids]], he turned to crime to finance his research, and dedicated his life to capturing Spider-Man. Smythe is best known for creating the [[Spider-Slayer]]s, robots designed specifically to hunt down, capture, or kill the web-slinger. He is also the father of [[Alistair Smythe]].\n\nThe character has appeared in several ''Spider-Man'' adaptations, including animated series and video games.\n\n==Publication history==\nSpencer Smythe and the Spider-Slayers first appeared in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #25 (June 1965) and were created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Steve Ditko]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=DeFalco |first1=Tom |last2=Sanderson |first2=Peter |last3=Brevoort |first3=Tom |last4=Teitelbaum |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |last6=Darling |first6=Andrew |last7=Forbeck |first7=Matt |last8=Cowsill |first8=Alan |last9=Bray |first9=Adam |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-7890-0 |page=338}}</ref> \n\n==Fictional character biography==\nProfessor Spencer Smythe was an expert in robotics and arachnids who asked [[J. Jonah Jameson]] to fund his projects, having been convinced by Jameson's editorials that [[Spider-Man]] was a menace. After watching a demonstration showing that Smythe's robot could sense and track spiders, Jameson hired Smythe to capture Spider-Man. Jameson himself controlled the robot, meaning that Spider-Man was chased by a machine with Jameson's face. However, the web-slinger escaped by leaving the Spider-Man suit wrapped in the robot's tentacles.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #105</ref>\n\nAnnoyed at his robot's inability to capture Spider-Man, Smythe began to obsess about the web-slinger, turning to crime to finance his research and constantly improving his robots which he dubbed [[Spider-Slayer]]s.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #106\u2013107</ref><ref>{{cite book |last =Rovin |first =Jeff |title =The Encyclopedia of Supervillains |publisher =Facts on File |date =1987 |location =New York |isbn = 0-8160-1356-X |page=6}}</ref> But his creations, no matter how deadly or powerful he made, were always defeated by Spider-Man utilizing a key flaw in their designs.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #107</ref>\n\nEventually, Smythe's criminal career came to an end when the radioactive materials used in the robots' manufacture poisoned him, dooming him to a slow and agonizing death.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #186</ref> Blaming Spider-Man and Jameson equally for his impending demise, Smythe handcuffed the two together with a bomb scheduled to detonate in 24 hours, determined to make the two suffer the agony of inescapable death that he saw the two as having condemned him to.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #190</ref> Unfortunately for Smythe, his disease was too advanced for him to survive the 24 hours himself, and he died convinced that he had killed off the two responsible. Peter Parker, however, had a pretty good grasp of what made mechanical devices tick, and was able to abort the bomb by freezing its controls mere moments before it would have detonated.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #192</ref>\n\nAfter Spencer's death, his son [[Alistair Smythe]] inherited the Spider-Slayer legacy.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' Annual 19</ref>\n\nDuring the ''[[Dead No More: The Clone Conspiracy]]'' storyline, a clone of the character is created by [[Jackal (Marvel Comics)|Miles Warren]]'s company New U Technologies.<ref>''Clone Conspiracy'' #2</ref>\n\n==In other media==\n===Television===\n[[Image:STAS Spencer Smythe.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Spencer Smythe as he appears in ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man: The Animated Series]]''.]]\n* A character named '''Henry Smythe''' appeared in the 1967 ''[[Spider-Man (1967 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'' series episode \"Captured by J.

When the real Spider-Man comes to the rescue, the ensuing battle leads to a fire at [[Oscorp]]. With Osborn's negative reinforcement, Spencer stays behind to ensure Spider-Man dies and Alistair gets the hover-chair, but is seemingly killed when Oscorp explodes. Later in the series, it is revealed that Spencer survived and was put into [[Cryopreservation|cryogenic suspension]] by the [[Kingpin (character)|Kingpin]] to ensure Alistair's loyalty after his son fell in with the crime lord.

Later, Spencer allies himself with the [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Vulture]] to seek revenge against [[Max Modell]] and creates his first Spider-Slayer to steal Harry's work from Horizon High, but it is eventually destroyed by Spider-Man.
