Timms is a petty criminal who escaped from prison to see his dying wife, until he drowned in the swamp bog for several years.

Marvel Comics.</ref> Shortly thereafter, the [[Leader (comics)|Leader]] resurrected it for a second battle against the Hulk. An explosion blew up the Glob into tiny fragments.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #129. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nThe Glob's brain later reformed into the Golden Brain. Yagzan and the Cult of Entropy used it as a weapon, but lost by the Entropists in an encounter with the [[Man-Thing]]. The Golden Brain psionically molded itself into an amnesiac blond-haired man. The man had been captured and mutated by Yagzan into a clay-based [[Outline of life forms|lifeform]] of the Glob. It battled the Man-Thing, reducing itself to mud again, which suffocates Yagzan, and killed him.<ref>''Giant-Size Man-Thing'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nHowever, it was later revealed that the Glob had been enslaved by the [[Collector (comics)|Collector]]. It eventually rebelled against him with the assistance of the Hulk and the Man-Thing.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #197-198. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nThe Glob then got taken into [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] custody where they recruited it in their organization's [[Nick Fury's Howling Commandos|Paranormal Containment Unit]].<ref>''Nick Fury's Howling Commandos'' #2-6. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nDuring the \"[[Avengers: Standoff!]]\" storyline, the Glob became an inmate of Pleasant Hill, a gated community established by S.H.I.E.L.D.<ref>''Avengers Standoff: Assault on Pleasant Hill Alpha'' #1.

He transformed into a light-green semi-humanoid being seemingly composed of bog matter and became the new '''Glob'''. It fled to the Florida Everglades, menaced [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]] and even battled the Hulk, who mistook it for the original Glob.

The Globs' bodies are difficult to harm, because their [[Mud|muddy]] exteriors can absorb physical attacks painlessly.<ref>''Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z'' Vol 1 #4 (September 2008)</ref>\n\nJoe Timms became the first Glob as a result from exposure to [[toxic waste]] in the [[swamp]]. As the Golden Brain, it has the ability to materialize an electrically-charged duplicate of its Glob form and recreate a physically perfect human body for itself.\n\nSumner Beckwith became the second Glob when he injected himself with a duplicate version of the Super-Soldier Formula. Unlike the original, it could excrete slime-like material from its own body to smother living beings or regenerate lost limbs. He earned a Ph.D. in [[genetics]], before his transformation.\n\n==Other characters named Glob==\nThere have been three other characters known as '''Glob''' in the Marvel Universe.
