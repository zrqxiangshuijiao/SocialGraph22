Her first appearance was in ''[[The Uncanny X-Men]]'' #139 as a surprise dance teacher for the newest X-Man/Student, [[Kitty Pryde]], a.k.a. Shadowcat. She has continued to make some scattered appearance in X-Men comic books.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nStevie Hunter was a professional dancer, but an injury to her knee ruined her career and forced her to discontinue her dancing full-time. As an alternative, she began teaching dance classes at a studio in [[North Salem, New York#Communities and locations|Salem Center]], her most notable student being [[Kitty Pryde]]. Stevie quickly became a best friend to Kitty, and on occasions made [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], who had unofficially taken up the mantle of Kitty's surrogate mother, slightly jealous of the attention that Kitty gave to Stevie.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #152</ref>\n\nAt one point, Stevie and Storm attended a ballet performance at the Metropolitan Opera House, where Stevie was captured and taken hostage by [[Arcade (Marvel Comics)|Arcade]]'s assistant Miss Locke and later rescued by the [[X-Men]].<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #145 (May 1981)</ref> Upon this incident, Stevie learned about the true identities of Kitty, Ororo and their friends, and became an ally of the X-Men and privy to their secrets. She later began physical education classes with the rookie [[New Mutants]], focusing on ballet. She would continue these sessions over the years.{{issue|date=April 2013}}\n\nStevie has tried to stay out of the fights the mutants get in, but has become involved in a few nevertheless. In one case, she and the New Mutants were involved in a fight against the demon [[S'ym]], who attacks them inside the X-Mansion. In trying to get a rattled Magik away from the fight, she ends up face to face with the demon. Her life was saved only by the magical might<!-- OK here: don't correct it--> of Illyana herself, turning the demon's loyalties. Even then S'ym offered to kill Stevie for knowing too much.<ref>''The New Mutants'' #14 (April 1984)</ref>\n\nIn a later incident, Stevie was present when forces from [[Genosha]] attacked the X-Mansion. She made it through a trapdoor to safety below, but unfortunately Storm, Warlock, Rictor, Boom-Boom and Wolfsbane, one of her original students, were kidnapped. Stevie did not go on the rescue mission.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #270 (Nov. 1990)</ref>\n\nIn one of her last major appearances, the [[Shadow King]] had taken over the mind of [[Colossus (comics)|Peter Rasputin]], Illyana's brother. Stevie helps [[Professor X]] stay one step ahead of Peter, until they can get to the mansion's [[Danger Room]]. This allows them to subdue Peter without harming him.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #279 (Aug. 1991)</ref>\n\nIn ''[[X-Men Gold]]'', Stevie Hunter reappears as a [[Member of Congress|Congresswoman]] attempting to assist Kitty's X-Men in presenting the mutant case during a governmental proposition for an unjust Mutant Deportation Act.<ref>''X-Men: Gold'' #9 (2017)</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix6/hunter_stevie.htm|Stevie Hunter}}\n*[http://www.uncannyxmen.net/db/characters/showquestion.asp?fldAuto=1301 Uncanny Xmen.net Database]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hunter, Stevie}}\n[[Category:Characters created by Chris Claremont]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1980]]\n[[Category:Characters created by John Byrne (comics)]]\n[[Category:Fictional African-American people]]\n[[Category:Fictional dancers]]\n[[Category:Fictional schoolteachers]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics female characters]]\n[[Category:X-Men supporting characters]]"}]}}}}
