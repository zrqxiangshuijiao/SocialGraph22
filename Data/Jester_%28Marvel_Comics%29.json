He was a struggling actor with a huge ego who finally got his big break as the leading character in an off-Broadway revival of ''[[Cyrano de Bergerac (play)|Cyrano de Bergerac]]''. Panned by critics, jeered by the audience, and disdained by his fellow performers, Powers was fired after one performance. Obsessively, he continued to study the various arts and crafts that he thought would earn him roles, things like gymnastics and body building. He turned down suggestions that he should take actual acting classes, insisting that he already had more raw acting talent than anyone who had ever lived. Still, Powers was only able to find employment as a stooge in a children's television show taped in New York.<ref name=\"DD42\"/>\n\nFinally getting fed up with having pies thrown in his face, Powers vents his anger with society by turning his extensive training in gymnastics and fencing to a life of crime. Contracting the criminal weapons-maker the [[Tinkerer (Marvel Comics)|Tinkerer]] to make him a number of gimmicks, Powers fashions himself a harlequin-like disguise and calls himself the Jester.<ref>{{cite book |last =Rovin |first =Jeff |title =The Encyclopedia of Supervillains |publisher =Facts on File |date =1987 |location =New York |isbn = 0-8160-1356-X |page=170}}</ref> After gaining some notoriety as a professional thief, the Jester is hired by Richard Raleigh to get [[Foggy Nelson]] to resign his campaign for district attorney. This brings the Jester into conflict with [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]], who continues trying to apprehend him, even after they find Raleigh dead. Angered by Daredevil's persistence, he vows revenge.<ref name=\"DD42\">''Daredevil'' #42 (July 1968)</ref>\n\nIn his civilian guise as Jonathan Powers, he stages his own murder at the hands of Daredevil.<ref>''Daredevil'' #44 (September 1968)</ref> However, Daredevil clears his name by defeating and then unmasking the Jester on live television, demonstrating that his \"victim\" was still alive.<ref>''Daredevil'' #45-46 (October-November 1968)</ref> He later escapes prison and teams up with two fellow enemies of Daredevil, the [[Cobra (Marvel Comics)|Cobra]] and [[Mister Hyde (comics)|Mister Hyde]], for revenge.

Though he succeeds in making Nelson lose his post as district attorney, his plan to take over the city and execute Daredevil for murder are foiled by Daredevil and new district attorney Blake Tower.<ref>''Daredevil'' #124, 129, 131, 133-137</ref> While in prison, the Jester falls under the mental control of the [[Purple Man]], along with the Cobra, Mister Hyde and the [[Gladiator (Melvin Potter)|Gladiator]].

When he afterwards learns that Daredevil was diverting the police's attention so that he could finish his performance, he voluntarily surrenders.<ref>''Daredevil'' #218 (May 1985)</ref> Later, Powers allows himself to be the host of a demon, gaining great strength in the process.

During his recent criminal activities, the Jester was defeated by [[Jessica Jones]] and the She-Hulk.<ref>''Spider-Men II'' #2</ref>\n\nThe Jester later collaborated with Screwball when they started a web show called \"Jested\". Their first episode had them doing a prank on Mayor [[J. Jonah Jameson]]. After that happened, both of them are tracked down by the [[The Superior Spider-Man|Superior Spider-Man]] ([[Doctor Octopus]]' mind in [[Spider-Man]]'s body) and (after performing a series of pranks on the Superior Spider-Man himself) are brutally defeated by him.<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #6.

Despite the [[She-Hulk]] making a passionate argument about the need to believe in redemption and not condemn someone for their thoughts, Powers is sentenced to prison, where he is shot by a prison guard during a riot a couple of days later.<ref>Bendis, Brian Michael (w), Coipel, Olivier (a), Ponsor, Justin (col), Cowles, Clayton (let), Brevoort, Tom; Moss, Wil (ed).

He was given his weaponry by [[Doctor Doom]]. Among the arsenal granted to him by Doom was the \"long-lived\" [[Hulk Robot]] created years prior by a pair of college students and the [[Eternals (comics)|Eternal]] [[Uni-Mind]]. The Jester recruited a team of villains made up of himself, the Hulk Robot, the [[Fenris (comics)|Fenris]] twins, [[Hydro-Man]], and Rock of the [[Hulkbusters]] to form the Assembly of Evil. The team was defeated by [[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Cloak and Dagger]] and several intervening [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].<ref>''Cloak & Dagger'' vol. 3 #9</ref>\n\nThe Jester appeared during the superhero [[Civil War (comic book)|''Civil War'']] as a member of the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts Army]]. As part of the Thunderbolts Army, the Jester was among the supervillains who helped capture unregistered heroes. The Jester did this due to nanobots in his system, which would electrocute him if he did not do as he was told.<ref>''Civil War'' #4</ref>\n\nThe Jester and [[Jack O'Lantern (Marvel Comics)|Jack O'Lantern]] are sent to bring in [[Spider-Man]].

Together with [[Saturnyne]], he hoped to save this world from the corruption that threatened it. Instead they encountered Earth-238's Mad Jim Jaspers, a lunatic with the ability to warp reality. Serving Jaspers was the Crazy Gang, which included the Jester.{{issue|date=April 2013}}\n\nThe '''Jester''', also known as the ''Clown'', is a very agile fighter and sometimes the self-proclaimed leader of the Crazy Gang. His Earth-238 counterpart was known as ''Coco''. This group of superhumans were based on characters from [[Lewis Carroll]]'s ''[[Through the Looking-Glass]]''. Captain Britain and Saturnyne individually managed to escape this Earth. Jaspers and the Crazy Gang, including the Jester, were killed when Earth-238 was destroyed by Saturnyne's successor, Mandragon.{{issue|date=April 2013}}\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nJonathan Powers is an athletic man with no superhuman abilities. His main weapons are a set of various joke gimmicks converted into deadly weapons, designed by the [[Tinkerer]]. He used a variety of modified toys and gimmicks, including a yo-yo with a weighted knob and steel cable which emits earsplitting sounds when whirled at high speed; ball bearing marbles; exploding gas-filled \"popcorn\"; plastic flying discs which squirt an anesthetic drug; rubber balls containing plastic explosives; an extendable artificial hand equipped with an electrical charge; an artificial hand that can be fired from a small air-cannon; and other devices. Powers also employed {{convert|2|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} miniature robots, equipped with items such as laser weaponry and diamond drill-bits, which were remotely controlled by a radio-linked microprocessor. He also employed a specially designed one-man submarine. Powers is a well-trained acrobat, hand-to-hand combatant and fencer. He is trained in gymnastics and is also a minimally talented actor.\n\nJody Putt has no superpowers, but possesses an arsenal of weaponry given to him by Doctor Doom.\n\nThe Crazy Gang's Jester has no superhuman powers, but he is a highly skilled acrobat, fencer and kickboxer, and carries a fencing foil.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of jesters]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix5/jesterpowers.htm|Jonathan Powers}}\n* {{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix5/jesterputt.htm|Jody Putt}}\n* [http://marvel.com/universe/Jester Jester] at Marvel.com\n\n{{Daredevil}}\n{{Moon Knight}}\n{{Spider-Man characters}}\n{{Stan Lee}}\n{{Alan Moore}}\n[[Category:Articles about multiple fictional characters]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Alan Davis]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Alan Moore]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Gene Colan]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Stan Lee]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1968]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1984]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1989]]\n[[Category:Daredevil (Marvel Comics) characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from New Jersey]]\n[[Category:Fictional actors]]\n[[Category:Fictional fencers]]\n[[Category:Fictional jesters]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics male supervillains]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics martial artists]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]\n[[Category:Spider-Man characters]]"}]}}}}
