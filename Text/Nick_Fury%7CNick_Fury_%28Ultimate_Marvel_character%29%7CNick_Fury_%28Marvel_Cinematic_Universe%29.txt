In ''[[Strange Tales]]'' #135 (Aug. 1965), the character was transformed into a [[James Bond]]-like spy and leading agent of the fictional espionage agency [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] The character makes frequent appearances in Marvel books as the former head of S.H.I.E.L.D., and as an intermediary between the U.S. government or the [[United Nations]] and various [[superhero]]es. It is eventually revealed that he takes a special medication called the Infinity Formula that halted his aging and allows him to be active despite being nearly a century old, later leading to him becoming '''The Unseen''', herald of [[Uatu|Uatu the Watcher]].\n\nNick Fury appears in several Marvel series set in [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universes]], as well as multiple animated films, television shows, and video games based on the comics.

Following several issues by creators Lee and Kirby, [[penciller]] [[Dick Ayers]] began his long stint on what would be his signature series; [[John Severin]] later joined as inker, forming a long-running, critically acclaimed team. [[Roy Thomas]] succeeded Lee as writer, followed by [[Gary Friedrich]], for whom this became a signature series as well. Annuals featured the \"Howlers\" called back to fight in the [[Korean War]] and [[Vietnam War]].\n\nThe Howling Commandos encountered [[Office of Strategic Services]] agent Reed Richards (later [[Mister Fantastic]] of the [[Fantastic Four]]) in #3 (Sept. 1963), and fought alongside [[Captain America]] and [[Bucky Barnes|Bucky]] in #13 (Dec. 1964).\n\n=== ''Strange Tales'' and solo series ===\n{{Main|Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.

The series won 1967 and 1968 [[Alley Award]]s, and was inducted in the latter year to the awards' Hall of Fame.

This ran 15 issues (June 1968\u2013Nov. 1969), followed by three all-reprint issues beginning a year later (Nov. 1970\u2013March 1971). Steranko wrote and drew issues #1\u20133 and #5, and drew the covers of #1\u20137.\n\nFury continued to make appearances in the other Marvel books, from ''Fantastic Four'' to ''[[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]]''. In 1972, ''Sgt. Fury and His Howling Commandos'' celebrated its 100th issue with a present-day reunion of the squad, sponsored by [[Stan Lee]] and the creative team behind the title. (Lee, like other comic books professionals, has made occasional cameos in his own books, in a tradition going back to the 1940s [[Golden Age of Comic Books]]).

The following year, writer Chaykin and penciller Corky Lehmkuhl produced the four-issue miniseries ''[[Fury of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'' (April\u2013July 1995). Various publications have additionally focused on Nick Fury's solo adventures, such as the [[graphic novel]]s and one-shots ''[[Wolverine/Nick Fury: The Scorpio Connection]]'' (1989), ''[[Wolverine/Nick Fury: Scorpio Rising]]'' (Oct. 1994), ''[[Fury/Black Widow: Death Duty]]'' and ''[[Captain America and Nick Fury: Blood Truce]]'' (both Feb. 1995), and ''[[Captain America and Nick Fury: The Otherworld War]]'' (Oct. 2001).

He shoots down [[Manfred von Richthofen]] early in his flying career, and is a highly decorated combat aviator by the end of the War in 1918.\n\nDischarged after the War, Jack returns home, marries an unnamed woman, and becomes the father of three children. Nick, probably born in the late 1910s or early 1920s, is followed by Jacob \"Jake\" Fury (later the [[supervillain]] [[Scorpio (Marvel Comics)|Scorpio]] who co-founded the [[Zodiac (comics)|Zodiac]] cartel), and their sister, Dawn.\n\nAll three children grow up in the neighborhood known as [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan]], New York. Nick is an [[Amateur boxing|amateur boxer]] through the [[Police Athletic League of New York City|New York City Police Athletic League]] where he learns marksmanship. As a teenager in 1937, he went overseas for the first time to fight with the [[International Brigades]] in the [[Spanish Civil War]].

In the early 1940s, their death-defying stunts catch the attention of [[Lieutenant]] [[Happy Sam Sawyer|Samuel \"Happy Sam\" Sawyer]], who was then training with the [[British Commandos]], who enlists them for a special mission in the [[Netherlands]]. Nick and Red later join the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]], with Fury undergoing Basic Training under Sergeant Bass. Nick and Red are stationed together at [[Schofield Barracks]], Hawaii when the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] ambushes the base on December 7, 1941. Red is among the many killed in the attack on Pearl Harbor, with Fury swearing vengeance against both the Japanese and the Nazis.\n\nSawyer, now a [[Captain (land)|captain]], assigns Fury command of the First Attack Squad, a unit of [[U.S. Army Ranger]]s, who are awarded the honorary title of Commandos by [[Winston Churchill]] after their first missions.

After making a full recovery, Fury begins working for the [[Office of Strategic Services]] (OSS), precursor of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). Six months into his service, he learns the extent of Sternberg's life-saving operation: the Infinity Formula has stopped his aging, but if he does not receive annual doses, he will age rapidly and die.

During this time the Howling Commandos are reformed, and Fury receives a [[battlefield commission]] to lieutenant. He later reaches the rank of [[colonel]]. During this time, he recommends the recruitment of married agents [[Richard and Mary Parker]], who will go on to become the parents of Fury's occasional superhero ally [[Spider-Man]]. Much later, the CIA uses him as a liaison to various superpowered groups that have begun appearing, including the [[Fantastic Four]], whom CIA agent Fury first encounters in ''Fantastic Four'' #21 (Dec. 1963).\n\nDuring his time with the CIA, Fury begins wearing his trademark eyepatch.

Under Fury, S.H.I.E.L.D. grows into one of the world's most powerful organizations, reaching covertly into national governments and forming strategic alliances with the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and other [[superhero]] groups, while always maintaining independence and deniability. Fury soon becomes the superhero community's main contact when government-related information is required in order to deal with a crisis.\n\nAfter years at the helm, Fury discovers that S.H.I.E.L.D. and Hydra have both fallen under the control of a group of sentient [[Life Model Decoy]] androids known as Deltites. Betrayed, Fury goes to ground, hunted by his fellow agents, many of whom are later revealed to have been replaced with Deltites.

He joined the [[United States Army]] after graduating from high school, eventually becoming a [[Colonel]]. He later left the army to join the [[Central Intelligence Agency]], where he served as a spy during the [[Cold War]]. He was eventually recruited to the covert espionage agency [[S.H.I.E.L.D. (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|S.H.I.E.L.D]].\n\nIn 1995, [[Kree (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Kree]] Empire [[Starforce (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Starforce]] member [[Carol Danvers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Vers]] crash-lands in [[Los Angeles]], drawing S.H.I.E.L.D. agents Fury and [[Phil Coulson]] to investigate. In an ensuing [[Skrulls (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Skrull]] attack, Fury kills a Skrull impersonating Coulson. Skrull commander [[Talos (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Talos]], disguised as Fury's boss Keller, orders Fury to work with Vers and keep tabs on her. Vers, escaping capture by the Skrull, uses memories they have extracted to bring Fury to the [[Features of the Marvel Cinematic Universe#Project Pegasus|Project Pegasus]] installation at a [[U.S. Air Force]] base. They discover Vers was Carol Danvers, a pilot presumed to have died in 1989 while testing an experimental jet engine designed by Dr. [[Mar-Vell (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Wendy Lawson]], whom Vers recognizes as a woman from her nightmares. After Fury informs S.H.I.E.L.D. of their location, a team led by Talos disguised as Keller arrives. Fury discovers Talos's ruse and helps Vers escape in a quadjet with Lawson's stowaway cat Goose. They fly to [[Louisiana]] to meet former pilot Maria Rambeau, the last person to see Vers and Lawson alive. Later, Danvers, Talos, Fury, and Rambeau locate Lawson's cloaked laboratory orbiting Earth, where Lawson hid several Skrulls, including Talos's family, and the [[Space Stone|Tesseract]], the power source of Lawson's engine. Danvers is captured by Starforce, and in the subsequent battle, Fury retrieves Goose, who is revealed to be an alien [[Species of the Marvel Cinematic Universe#Flerken|Flerken]]. Goose swallows the Tesseract and scratches Fury's face, blinding his left eye. Danvers departs to help the Skrulls find a new homeworld, leaving Fury a modified [[pager]] to contact her in an emergency. Meanwhile, Fury drafts an initiative to locate heroes like Danvers, naming it after her Air Force [[Aviator call sign|call sign]], \"Avenger\".\n\nLater, Fury became the Deputy Chief of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s [[Bogot\u00e1]] station, where he \"proved his leadership mettle\" by engineering the rescue of hostages captured by Colombian rebels at the country's embassy, including the daughter of then-S.H.I.E.L.D. Director [[Alexander Pierce (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Alexander Pierce]], prompting Pierce to make him director of S.H.I.E.L.D., while Pierce joined the [[World Security Council]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2456051/captain-marvel-what-we-know-so-far-about-nick-furys-past|title=Captain Marvel: What We Know So Far About Nick Fury's Past|date=August 20, 2018|publisher=CinemaBlend|access-date=September 20, 2019|archive-date=September 20, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190920144530/https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2456051/captain-marvel-what-we-know-so-far-about-nick-furys-past|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Assembling the Avengers===\n{{further|Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man 2|Thor (film)|Captain America: The First Avenger|The Avengers (2012 film)|Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. (season 1)}}\n\nIn 2010, Fury visits [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark]] in his Malibu home and recruits him into the \"Avengers Initiative\".\n\nSix months later in 2011, Fury approaches Stark at [[Randy's Donuts]], revealing that Stark's recently acquired new assistant \"Natalie Rushman\" is S.H.I.E.L.D. Agent [[Natasha Romanoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Natasha Romanoff]] and that his father [[Howard Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Howard]] was a S.H.I.E.L.D. founder whom Fury knew personally. Fury explains that Vanko's father Anton and Howard invented the arc reactor together, but when Anton tried to sell it, Howard had him deported. Fury gives Stark some of his father's old material, enabling Stark to synthesize a new element for his arc reactor that ends his palladium dependency. Later, Fury informs Stark that because of his difficult personality, S.H.I.E.L.D. intends to use him only as a consultant.\n\nShortly before the Battle of New York in 2012, Fury enlists Dr. [[Erik Selvig]] to study the Tesseract. In New York City, he oversees the reintroduction of [[Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Steve Rogers]] into society. Fury is present with his colleague and friend [[Maria Hill (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Maria Hill]] at the S.H.I.E.L.D. facility when [[Loki (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Loki]] arrives to steal the Tesseract and take control of Agent [[Clint Barton (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Clint Barton]] and Selvig. Fury calls in Romanoff, Stark, Rogers, and [[Bruce Banner (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Bruce Banner]] to fight Loki. Later, Fury uses Coulson's death to motivate the Avengers, now including [[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thor]], to work as a team, leading to their stand against Loki and the invading [[Chitauri (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Chitauri]] army in New York City. When the World Security Council authorizes the nuclear bombing of the city to defeat the invasion, Fury uses a rocket launcher to take out one of the two jets launching for that mission, but is too late to stop the second, which fires a missile that is intercepted by Stark.\n\nAfter Loki's defeat, Fury authorizes the use of alien technology to resurrect Coulson from death and, in response to the invasion, convinces the Council that the world needs \"a quantum surge in threat analysis\".\n\n===Fighting Hydra and Ultron===\n{{further|Captain America: The Winter Soldier|Avengers: Age of Ultron}}\n\nIn 2014, Fury trains Rogers to be a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent and proposes Project Insight: three S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarriers armed with spy satellite guided guns, designed to preemptively eliminate threats. The Helicarriers are capable of continuous suborbital flight, due to new Repulsor engines proposed by Stark, their guns can kill 1,000 targets per minute, and the satellites, launched from the ''Lemurian Star'', a S.H.I.E.L.D. vessel, can read a target's DNA anywhere in the world. However, when the project is a few weeks away from completion, Fury grows suspicious about Insight. He hires an Algerian mercenary, [[Georges Batroc (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Georges Batroc]], to hijack the ''Star'' as cover to allow Romanoff onto the ship with Rogers to retrieve data regarding Insight. Though Romanoff is successful, Fury is unable to decrypt the data, increasing his suspicions and forcing him to convince Pierce to delay the project. Shortly afterwards, an attempt is made on Fury's life by [[Hydra (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Hydra]], which is revealed to have taken over S.H.I.E.L.D. Fury is apparently killed by their most dangerous assassin, the Winter Soldier, but he is revealed to have faked his death using Tetrodotoxin B, a drug designed by Banner that was capable of slowing down the heart to 1 beat per minute. Rogers, [[Sam Wilson (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Sam Wilson]], and Romanoff are taken by Hill to see him alive and in a hidden bunker. After it is revealed that Pierce is working for Hydra, Fury reappears to override Hydra's control of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s computer systems, forcing Pierce to unlock S.H.I.E.L.D's database so Romanoff can leak classified information, exposing Hydra to the public. Fury reveals that although Pierce had deleted Fury's retinal scan from the system, Fury had a backup scan of his destroyed other eye. He then tells Rogers, Wilson, and Romanoff that he is to go into hiding in Europe to hunt down more Hydra cells.\n\nOnce Hydra's plan to control the world is foiled, Fury appears to assist S.H.I.E.L.D. agents in the aftermath of those events, rescuing agents [[Leo Fitz]] and [[Jemma Simmons]] from drowning in the ocean and providing Agent Coulson with the [[Destroyer (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Destroyer gun]] to take out enemy soldiers, before they confront [[John Garrett (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|John Garrett]] and [[Mike Peterson (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Deathlok]]. In the aftermath, Coulson vaporizes Garrett and criticizes Fury for using GH325 to revive him. Fury responds that he values Coulson as much as any Avenger, because he represents the heart and moral center of S.H.I.E.L.D., and declares Coulson the new director of S.H.I.E.L.D., tasking him with rebuilding the organization from scratch, and equips him with a 'toolbox' containing useful data.\n\nIn 2015, Fury arrives at Barton's home to help and motivate Stark, Rogers, Romanoff, Banner, and Barton to formulate a plan to stop [[Ultron (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Ultron]]. He, Hill, and other former agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., and [[James Rhodes (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|James Rhodes]] use the original helicarrier to help the Avengers in [[Sokovia]] during the final battle against Ultron. Afterwards, he oversees the Avengers transition into the new [[Avengers Compound]].\n\nCoulson subsequently reveals to Gonzalez and his board that he and Fury had discovered that the original helicarrier survived HYDRA's attack and repaired it as a failsafe in case of an emergency.\n\n===Aftermath of the Infinity War===\n{{further|Avengers: Infinity War|Avengers: Endgame|Spider-Man: Far From Home}}\n\nIn 2018, Fury and Hill are travelling in [[Atlanta]] discussing the Avengers' whereabouts when Hill suddenly disintegrates due to [[the Blip]], prompting Fury to use his pager to summon Danvers, before he too disintegrates.\n\nIn 2023, Fury is restored to life and attends Stark's funeral, reuniting with Danvers. Some time later, he appoints Talos and [[Soren (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Soren]] to impersonate him and Hill while he takes a vacation in space on a Skrull ship.\n\nIn 2024, Fury is informed by Talos via phone call that [[Peter Parker (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Peter Parker]] received [[Features of the Marvel Cinematic Universe#Tony Stark's glasses|Tony Stark's glasses]]. Talos then asked Fury to come back to Earth, as people were beginning to ask what happened to the Avengers. Still in space, Fury disconnects the call.\n\n==Alternate versions==\n{{See also|What If...? (TV series)}}\nSeveral [[parallel universes in fiction|alternate versions]] of Nick Fury appear in the animated series ''What If...?'', with Jackson reprising his role.\n\n===Meeting Captain Carter===\n{{further|What If... Captain Carter Were the First Avenger?}}\nIn an alternate 2012, Fury and Barton meet [[Captain Carter]] after she arrives through a portal opened by the Tesseract.\n\n===Death of the Avengers===\n{{further|What If... the World Lost Its Mightiest Heroes?|What If... the Watcher Broke His Oath?}}\nIn an alternate 2010, Fury witnesses Stark, Barton, Thor, and Romanoff's deaths during his Avengers Initiative recruitment campaign. He eventually deduces that their murders were instigated by [[Hank Pym (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Hank Pym]] and temporarily allies with Loki to confront him in [[San Francisco]]. After Pym is defeated, Loki quickly subjugates the planet and becomes its ruler, prompting Fury to summon Danvers and awaken Rogers.\n\nSometime later, Fury leads a resistance movement against Loki and his army with a new Avengers team composed of Rogers and Danvers. As they fight on the Helicarrier, Fury watches as a Romanoff from another universe appears and subdues Loki with his Scepter. Despite acknowledging that she is not the Romanoff he knows, Fury praises her for sharing the same spirit and recruits her into the Avengers.\n\n===Stopping Thor's party===\n{{Further|What If... Thor Were an Only Child?}}\nIn an alternate timeline, Fury goes to [[Las Vegas]] to confront Thor regarding his out-of-control intergalactic party, but is accidentally knocked out by [[Korg (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Korg]] during one of his [[Cannonball (diving)|cannonball]]s and falls into a [[coma]], forcing Maria Hill to take over as acting director of S.H.I.E.L.D.\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical response===\nIn a generally positive review of ''The Avengers'', [[Associated Press]] reviewer [[Christy Lemire]] wrote that \"[t]he no-nonsense Nick Fury (Samuel L.

During the [[invasion of Sicily]], he, along with Private Fisk (the grandfather of [[Kingpin (character)|Wilson Fisk]]) and Canadian paratrooper Corporal [[Wolverine (Ultimate Marvel character)|Howlett]], attempted to loot a house. American military police arrived to arrest them, and all three were subdued. Fisk was grazed by a bullet, while Fury was imprisoned in an unknown location alongside several other black men, and Howlett, despite protests that he was Canadian, was also shipped to an unknown location.<ref>''Ultimate Origins'' #1 (2008)</ref> Fury was selected to be the next test subject for Project: Rebirth, as his blood work most closely matched that of Subject #22, the most successful of the previous test subjects. He was injected with a serum that gave him super-strength, which he used to free himself and the other prisoners, who then escaped. The scientists who were working on him let him escape, deciding that they have all the information that they needed for now.<ref name=\"Ultimate Origins #2 2008\">''Ultimate Origins'' #2 (2008)</ref>\n\nAfter attending college in [[India]], Fury enlisted in the U.S. military, where he was deployed into various conflicts such as the [[Kosovo War]]. He was later assigned to [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'s [[Weapon X]] program in the original [[Gulf War]]. While transporting the mind wiped Wolverine in an [[adamantium]] cage, an Iraqi guerrilla ambushed and killed his team, inadvertently freeing Wolverine from his prison. After slaughtering the Iraqi guards, Wolverine discovered Fury, the only survivor of the ambush, and transported him back through the desert to the Allied forces. Although Wolverine was summarily subdued and re-imprisoned by his handlers, a bond between the two men was formed.<ref name=\"Ultimate X-Men: Return to Weapon X\">''Ultimate X-Men: Return to Weapon X''</ref> The next day, Fury, already mostly healed, was confronted by [[Thunderbolt Ross|General Thaddeus Ross]]. The General had discovered much was unusual about Fury and questioned him at length, prompting him to reexamine where he was going in life.<ref>''Ultimate Origins'' #3 (2008)</ref>\n\n===Director of S.H.I.E.L.D. and Ultimates===\nYears later, the [[Ultimate X-Men|X-Men]] were abducted and imprisoned by the Weapon X program. This program was overseen at the time by [[John Wraith|Wraith]], who had previously staged a coup against General Ross. This coup had prevented Ross from dismantling the Weapon X program altogether. Wolverine, the only X-Man who eludes capture, later asks Fury for help in freeing the other X-Men and bringing down the Weapon X program. During the operation, which also involves the [[Brotherhood of Mutants]], Wraith was about to kill Nightcrawler, but was shot dead by Fury.<ref name=\"Ultimate X-Men: Return to Weapon X\"/>\n\nFury is summarily promoted to [[General]] and resumes the duties of the Director of S.H.I.E.L.D. He was tasked with forming a team to battle posthuman threats and resurrecting the [[supersoldier|Super-Soldier]] program, two objectives that resulted in the formation of the [[Ultimates]]. Fury operates as the commander of the team, at times leading them into action, though he often shares duties with the revived World War II hero [[Captain America (Ultimate Marvel character)|Captain America]] and billionaire genius [[Iron Man (Ultimate Marvel character)|Iron Man]]. Nick Fury is also responsible for monitoring superhumans who are not affiliated with the U.S. Military, including [[Spider-Man (Ultimate Marvel character)|Peter Parker]] and the X-Men.<ref>''Ultimates #1''</ref>\n\nNick Fury lost his right arm in a battle against the [[Masters of Evil|Liberators]] in [[The Ultimates 2]]. He replaced it shortly thereafter with a bionic one.\n\n===Ultimate Spider-Man===\nNick Fury has also been involved in the ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' comics. In them, he meets Peter after [[Alternative versions of Green Goblin#Ultimate Marvel|Norman Osborn]] returns. He states that S.H.I.E.L.D. was able to figure out who Peter was because of the security shots of the [[OZ (Ultimate Marvel)|OZ]] Spider biting Peter, as well as [[Dr. Octopus]] screaming that Peter Parker is Spider-Man while in jail. Nick Fury has been watching Peter and informs him that, due to his illegal genetically altered status, he will become the property of S.H.I.E.L.D. when he turns eighteen. Although Fury wants him to be part of the Ultimates, this may have changed because the Ultimates broke apart. Peter and Fury's relationship became strained after the [[Hobgoblin (comics)|''Hobgoblin'']] arc. Peter punches Fury for ignoring his questions for why [[Harry Osborn]] became the Hobgoblin. At that point, Fury told one of his scientists that he wanted to know everything about OZ and that it was time for Peter Parker to lose his spider powers. This follows on to the ''[[Ultimate Clone Saga]]'', in which it is revealed by Fury that the [[Tinkerer]]'s [[Spider-Slayer]]s were developed to handle Peter if and when he ever went insane. [[Mary Jane Watson]], upon discovering Fury's intentions, tells him that Peter looks up to him like a father. This convinced Fury to let Peter keep his powers, and he apologizes to Peter, stating that in his line of work he's been trained to expect someone in Peter's position to crack under stress.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #100</ref>\n\n===Ultimate Power===\nDuring ''[[Ultimate Power]]'', Fury was judged to be at least partially responsible for the devastation of much of [[Earth-31916]] along with [[Emil Burbank#Supreme Power|Emil Burbank]]. Burbank had sought a means to defeat the [[Hyperion (Supreme Power)|Hyperion]] of that universe. An alien organism, unleashed in an attempt to achieve this, spread throughout the United States, causing widespread devastation. A probe sent by [[Maker (Reed Richards)|Reed Richards]] provided evidence that an \"invasion from another universe\" was responsible. The [[Squadron Supreme (Supreme Power)|Squadron Supreme]] was dispatched to the Ultimate Universe in order to arrest Richards so that he could stand trial for his \"crimes\". A lengthy battle ensued between the Squadron on one side and the [[Ultimates]], Spider-Man, the [[Ultimate X-Men|X-Men]], and the [[Ultimate Fantastic Four|Fantastic Four]] on the other. Richards, believing himself to be responsible when the Squadron produced his probe as evidence, surrendered himself. Fury was unwilling to accept this and convinced [[Thor (Ultimate Marvel character)|Thor]] to create a bridge to Earth-31916, through which the [[Helicarrier]] was able to travel. Once there, another battle between the Squadron and the Ultimate Universe heroes began. Spider-Man learns that Fury had an ulterior motive - the retrieval of the probes and their data, and had conspired with Doctor Doom to do so. In addition, Fury had brought insurance in the form of the [[Hulk (Ultimate Marvel character)|Hulk]]. It took the combined power of the Ultimate Universe heroes, the Earth-31916 Squadron Supreme, and their [[Squadron Supreme|counterparts from Earth-712]] to defeat the Hulk, but Doom had proven to be simply a [[Doombot]]. To stop the fighting, the Ultimates agreed to turn over Fury to the Earth-31916 Squadron and to allow [[Power Princess#Power Princess: Supreme Power|Power Princess]] to return with them to their universe. Fury tries to convince them that they are making a mistake, but his pleas are ignored.<ref>''Ultimate Power'' #1-9</ref>\n\nFury is seen still stranded in Earth-31916 in ''Squadron Supreme'' (Vol. 2) #1. He has apparently fulfilled the prophecy made by Hyperion in ''Ultimate Power'' #9: \"Given the strength of our military industrial complex, Fury would have risen here to even greater heights than your homeworld.\"<ref>[http://www.marvel.com/catalog/?id=9099 ''SQUADRON SUPREME 2'' #1 - Marvel Comics Publishing Catalog<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n===Ultimatum===\nFury returns to the Ultimate Universe in ''[[Ultimatum (comics)|Ultimatum]]'' #4 and is instrumental in defeating [[Alternative versions of Magneto|Magneto]]. [[Alternative versions of Jean Grey|Jean Grey]] telepathically relays the information discovered by Fury in ''[[Ultimate Origins]]'' that mutants are not the next stage in human evolution, but are in fact the result of experimentation done by humans. This revelation causes Magneto to reverse the damage done to the Earth's magnetic poles.<ref>''Ultimatum'' #4-5</ref>\n\nFollowing the events of ''Ultimatum'', Fury is informed by [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Hawkeye]] about how Captain America discovered the secret of the [[Red Skull]]. Fury asks head of S.H.I.E.L.D. [[Carol Danvers]] for permission to start up a \"death squad\" in order to catch the Red Skull and Cap, which he then carries out with the help of Hawkeye, [[Gregory Stark]], and the rest of the [[Ultimate Comics: Avengers|Ultimate Avengers]].<ref>''Ultimate Comics: Avengers'' #1</ref>\n\n===Project: Avengers===\nIn ''[[Ultimate Comics: Avengers]]'' Fury returned to S.H.I.E.L.D. again. After learning that Captain America went rogue after discovering that the [[Red Skull]] was his biological son, Fury re-activated \"Project Avenger\" and recruited a team of questionable super humans to find Captain America.<ref>''Ultimate Avengers'' #1-5</ref> Following Captain America's capture, Fury briefed the Avengers of AIM's purpose of creating the Cosmic Cube to build their visioned utopia and readied his team to thwart the organization's plans.\n\nFury guided his team of Avengers from headquarters, with the secret intent to go ahead with \"Plan B\", which is to detonate a nuclear warhead that was built into War Machine's armor by Dr. [[Gregory Stark]] in case the mission failed.\n\nCaptain America managed to arrive at the location of the battle between the Red Skull and the Avengers and teleported the jet to the exact location where the Red Skull was standing, impaling him through the chest with one of the rods that protrudes from its nose. The Red Skull was taken to a hospital and kept alive long enough for Gail, his mother, to say her goodbyes. Red Skull explained to Fury that all he wanted to do with the Cosmic Cube was turn back time and prevent Steve Rogers from being lost during the war so that he could grow up with him and lead a normal life, rather than the one he was given. [[Petra Laskov]], dressed as a doctor, then entered the room and shot Red Skull in the head, killing him.\n\nA short time later, Fury is fixing his damaged prosthetic arm while speaking with Gregory Stark. Gregory concludes that it was in fact Fury himself who hired the Red Skull to come out of retirement, in some sort of plot to resurrect Project Avengers, securing him a position in S.H.I.E.L.D.'s employment and eventually regaining his old title as Director. Fury told him that was how he got the job the first time, and expects the same outcome this time as well.<ref>''Ultimate Comics: Avengers'' #6</ref> Fury and his Avengers later faced threats from the [[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|Ghost Rider]]<ref>''Ultimate Comics: Avengers 2'' #1-6</ref> and a [[vampiric]] menace.<ref>''Ultimate Comics: Avengers 3'' #1-6</ref> In ''Ultimate Avengers vs. New Ultimates'', Stark would end up framing Fury for selling information to [[North Korea]] and stealing his position as S.H.I.E.L.D. Director and charging Fury's ex-assistant [[Carol Danvers]]' New Ultimates to apprehend him, ending in a standstill when Stark caught Fury, revealing he was manipulating both. Fury and his Avengers take down Stark's forces with Thor landing a strike from his hammer, killing Gregory. <ref>''Ultimate Avengers vs. New Ultimates'' #6</ref>\n\nIn \"[[Ultimate Enemy]]\", approximately six months after Ultimatum, Fury is Black OPS and is \"Off the Grid\". He was enjoying a meal while under cover when the restaurant he was at was attacked by a creature with energy powers. Fury manages to hold the creature at bay until Spider-Man and [[Johnny Storm|Human Torch]] arrive at the scene to investigate. The creature vanishes after a short battle with the three of them. Peter is surprised to see Fury alive, as he has not seen him for months.<ref>''Ultimate Enemy'' #1</ref>\n\nNick breaks into the [[Triskelion (comics)|Triskelion]] and confronts Carol Danvers in the ladies' room and points a gun to her head, exclaiming that she is the only person who knew he was alive and would have motive to have him killed. The two fight before being interrupted by a female S.H.I.E.L.D. agent, informing Danvers that an attack has been made in Queens, which Fury knows is where the Parker residence is located. Simultaneously, the two order a Battalion of [[Hulkbusters|Hulkbuster]] agents to get to Queens to intercept the attacker, where they succeed in apprehending the monster attacking superhumans.<ref>''Ultimate Enemy'' #3</ref>\n\nAttempting to atone for his mistakes with Peter, Fury has taken on a more direct mentor role for [[Miles Morales]] as the new Spider-Man.\n\nWhen the [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]] of Earth-616 is [[Spider-Men|sent to the Ultimate Universe]], Fury interrogates him for information about his presence in this universe, accepting Peter's story that he came from another universe as nobody would come up with something that insane as a lie. Peter also notes that Ultimate Nick Fury is a lot cooler than the [[Nick Fury|version]] Peter knows.<ref>''Spider-Men'' #2</ref> Attempting to atone for his mistakes with his Peter, Fury allows the other Peter to visit his counterpart's family,<ref>''Spider-Men'' #4</ref> and is satisfied when Peter gives Miles his blessing to become that world's new Spider-Man.<ref>''Spider-Men'' #5</ref>\n\n===Taking on HYDRA, Formation of the Howling Commandos===\nNick joined [[Hydra (Marvel Comics)|HYDRA]] using a bio-camouflage to change his appearance under the name of \"Scorpio\" (resembling his classic mainstream look), stating that his motivations were to destroy the government that took everything away from him, although he still had a different agenda apart from Hydra's. The Ultimates managed to track him and tried to capture him, believing he was the traitor who provided Hydra with S.H.I.E.L.D. weapons. During an attack to Hydra's [[Death's Head]] camp, it was revealed Nick Fury was trying to destroy Hydra from the inside, while the S.H.I.E.L.D. traitor was actually Hydra leader Commander Crimson who used an [[Infinity Gem]] to battle her enemies, until a burst of energy made her disappear along with the artifact.<ref>''Ultimate Comics: Ultimates'' #20</ref>\n\nIn the aftermath of the battle, Nick told [[Monica Chang]] he was planning to create his own team, the [[Howling Commandos]], to battle Hydra the way the Ultimates couldn't, along ex-Hydra agent [[Abigail Brand]]. Before leaving, Chang told Fury he would be under her supervision.<ref>''Ultimate Comics: Ultimates'' #21</ref>\n\n==Abilities and technologies==\nLike his Earth-616 counterpart, Nick Fury is an active physical man despite being over 80 years of age. Initially, he was not shown to use the Infinity Formula or other physical enhancements that his mainstream Marvel Universe counterpart possessed. However, Fury was later revealed to have served during World War II and was a test subject of the Super Soldier program (albeit as an unwilling participant). In this reality, the Super Soldier serum not only gave Fury low level super-human strength and agility but has also reduced his aging, allowing Fury to continue to be active despite his advanced chronological age.<ref name=\"Ultimate Origins #2 2008\"/>\n\nFury has had his right arm replaced with a cybernetic arm that gives him even greater strength than his enhanced biological original.<ref>''Ultimates 2'' #7</ref> The exact level of his cybernetic arm has not been specifically revealed. Unlike his mainstream counterpart who retains his injured eye despite being legally blind in it with a 95% vision loss, Fury has actually lost his left eye. The skin around the left eye-socket is shown to be badly scarred, extending beyond the eye patch.\n\nFury is an exceptional combatant and strategist and a gifted field leader. In his earliest appearances, he operated with technology years ahead of traditional forces, including the latest experimental weaponry, and some form of projected invisibility and the ability to walk through solid matter. These powers have very limited windows due to massive expense for any moment of \"uptime\"; costs for these run to the millions for less than a minute of use. He once used a chewing gum that was programmed to explode after 200 chews. The number of instances in which Fury uses these technologies has decreased since ''[[The Ultimates]]'' #1, and Fury is shown to primarily use conventional firearms.\n\nWhile General Fury was Director of S.H.I.E.L.D. he was constantly monitored and shadowed by dozens of S.H.I.E.L.D. agents and all known observation technologies.  After leaving S.H.I.E.L.D., Fury has shown that he knows how to elude all such monitoring devices to the point that he was able to enter the S.H.I.E.L.D helicarrier and attack the current Director Carol Danvers.\n\n==In other media==\n{{Main|Nick Fury in other media|Nick Fury (Marvel Cinematic Universe)}}\nMost appearances of Nick Fury in other media since the 2000s have been modeled on the Ultimate Marvel version of the character, most notably in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] where he is portrayed by Samuel L.
