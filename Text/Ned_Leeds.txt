A [[supporting character]] in stories featuring the superhero [[Spider-Man]], he has been a reporter for the ''[[Daily Bugle]]'', and the [[Abusive power and control|abusive husband]] of [[Betty Brant]]. Leeds is the third character to take on the [[Hobgoblin (comics)|'''Hobgoblin''']] mantle as a [[supervillain]]; ten years following his [[assassination]], he is [[Retroactive continuity|retroactively established]] to have been willingly [[Brainwashing|brainwashed]] to serve as a [[stand-in]] for the true first Hobgoblin and [[wiktionary:mastermind|mastermind]], and killed before he could give them up to the authorities for a lesser sentence: prior to this, from [[1987 in comics|1987]] to [[1997 in comics|1997]], Ned was originally depicted as having been the true identity of the first Hobgoblin. The character was revived in a [[2018 in comics|2018]]\u2013[[2021 in comics|2021]] storyline where he was revealed to have been a willing Hobgoblin, faking his death to seek revenge on [[Foreigner (character)|the Foreigner]] for having attempted to kill him, and using the brainwashing story to convince Betty to take him back and [[Pregnancy|impregnate]] her.\n\n[[Jacob Batalon]] portrays [[Ned Leeds (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Ned Leeds]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU), appearing in ''[[Spider-Man: Homecoming]]'' (2017), ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'' (2018), ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'' and ''[[Spider-Man: Far From Home]]'' (both 2019), and ''[[The Daily Bugle (web series)|The Daily Bugle]]'' and ''[[Spider-Man: No Way Home]]'' (both 2021).\n\n==Publication history==\nCreated by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Steve Ditko]], Ned Leeds made his first appearance in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #18 (November 1964). His character is killed off in the 1986 one-shot ''Spider-Man vs. Wolverine'', written by then Spider-Man editor [[Jim Owsley]]. [[Tom DeFalco]], [[Ron Frenz]], and [[Peter David]] (of the creative teams on the ongoing Spider-Man books) found this objectionable, saying that Owsley gave them no warning that he was going to kill Leeds, then a regular cast member in the Spider-Man books. Frenz remarked:\n\n{{blockquote|Owsley let Tom [DeFalco] and I continue with our plans without telling us in advance that he was going to kill Ned. We had no heads up until ''Spider-Man vs. Wolverine'' came out that Ned Leeds was killed in that story. I can't speak to why he did it, but I can speak to the way he did it. He kept it a big secret until we felt screwed.<ref>{{cite journal|last= Greenberg|first= Glenn|author-link= Glenn Greenberg|date= August 2009|title= When Hobby Met Spidey|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue= 35|page= 18|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}</ref>}}\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n\nNed Leeds was a reporter for the ''[[Daily Bugle]]''.

He was a normal man who engaged in regular exercise, which increased to more intensive levels after assuming the Hobgoblin role. While brainwashed, Ned wore the Hobgoblin's uniform and used the glider and equipment which included Jack O'Lantern bombs, razor bats and electrical shock gloves. However, he had no healing factor or superhuman strength.\n\n==Other versions==\n===Ultimate Marvel===\nThe [[Ultimate Marvel]] version of Ned Leeds is a reporter for the ''Daily Bugle'' and an alcoholic with an antagonistic relationship with [[Betty Brant]].<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #121.
