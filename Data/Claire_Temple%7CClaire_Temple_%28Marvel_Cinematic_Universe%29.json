The series introduces Temple's mother (portrayed by [[S\u00f4nia Braga]]), and gives Claire \"a large storyline ...

She did think that she would return to ''Luke Cage'' if it was renewed for further seasons, and again expressed interest in appearing in ''The Punisher'' at some point moving forward \"just so I can feel like I\u2019ve done every show\".<ref name=\"DawsonFuture\" /> Dawson later revealed that she had asked ''Luke Cage'' showrunner [[Cheo Hodari Coker]] whether she could contribute to the writing of Temple's last scene in the season; she considered the scene to be the culmination of three years of work for her, and felt that it had initially been written too much from the perspective of Cage, whom Temple has a fight with in the scene that ends their relationship.

She\u2019s not a love interest\u2014she\u2019s this skeptical eye looking at this strange situation.\" On the relationship between Temple and Murdock in ''Daredevil'', Dawson said, \"The show explores how necessary it is for two people to finally have their masks off with each other. For Matt Murdock, this is the first person he has that\u2019s going to be able to see that transition for him ... But she gets confronted with the question: How far will you go? What does it mean if you\u2019re helping someone who is maybe going to hurt other people?\"<ref name=\"DawsonTime\" />\n\nDawson felt that the character resonated with audiences, and was brought back for more series, because, \"She's funny, she's wry, she's strong\u2014she's built for that world, because she's great under pressure. She's someone\u2014hero or not\u2014you'd want to have in a dire situation... I really just liked her arc all the way through.\" After the character is shown using fighting in ''Daredevil'', Dawson explained, \"her eyes have been opened up to this other world\u2014and she's crossed the line. You know, this is someone who helps people, and she's been violent now but seeing the need for it. I think there's a lot that she's having to grapple with\".<ref name=\"DawsonMTV\" /> Discussing Temple's relationship with Cage in ''Luke Cage'', Colter said that \"she will deal with me in a different way than she dealt with Matt Murdock. Matt Murdock's character's completely different from mine. Because she plays a nurse that basically seems to be in the right place at the right time, and she's very good at helping out superheroes who are in need ... I think she's going to be a very good companion for Luke.
