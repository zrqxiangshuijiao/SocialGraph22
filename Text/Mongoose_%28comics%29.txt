At one point, the Mongoose arrives in New York where he is invited by [[Baron Zemo#Baron Helmut Zemo|Baron Zemo]] II to join his [[Masters of Evil]].<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #283</ref> Mongoose later battles both [[Spider-Man]] and [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], and this confrontation eventually causes Thor and Mongoose to become mortal enemies. After his first defeat at the hands of Thor, Mongoose flees. During his escape, he causes a fall of girders which injures Erik Masterson, better known as [[Thunderstrike (Eric Masterson)|Thunderstrike]].<ref>''Thor'' #391</ref>\n\nIn a later plot against Thor, Mongoose teams up with [[Quicksand (comics)|Quicksand]] and Count Tagar to obtain cell samples from Thor. He joins Tagar into using a weapon called the \"vivisector\" to obtain the samples, while Quicksand causes a distraction as she battles Thor so her teammates could obtain what they were after.<ref>''Thor'' #402-403</ref> Tagar hadn't enough from one sample and orders Mongoose to obtain more. Mongoose kidnaps Masterson in return, though against Tagar's wishes. Mongoose also manages to launch an attack against Thor at [[Wundagore|Wundagore Mountain]] by the [[New Men (Marvel Comics)|New Men]]. This group is a collection of genetically altered warriors who defend Wundagore. When Thor eventually realizes what was going on, both Mongoose, Quicksand and Tagar are defeated, and Mongoose once again manages to escape after Tagar halted the battle.<ref>''Thor'' #405-406</ref>\n\nMongoose tries to rejoin the New Men, but they deny affiliation with him because they heard of his villainous tricks. Feeling furious over this, Mongoose later attacks both Thor and Erik Masterson in retaliation. He is about to defeat them, but another God called [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]] steps in to assist. Mongoose realizes he had no chance of winning and fled yet again.<ref>''Thor'' #408</ref>\n\nMongoose is arrested by [[Helmut Zemo|Baron Zemo]]'s [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] after a battle in [[Philadelphia]].<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #104</ref> Instead of a legally required trial process, he is offered membership in the team or outright jail. Refusing to go to jail, Mongoose accepts the offer to join the team. \n\nMongoose has been identified as one of the 142 registered superheroes who are a part of the [[Fifty State Initiative]].<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #1</ref><ref>[http://www.marvel.com/news/comicstories.947 ''Avengers: The Initiative'' #1 Character Map]</ref>\n\n[[Alyosha Kravinoff|Alyosha Kraven]] later began collecting a zoo of animal-themed superhumans,<ref>''The Punisher War Journal'' vol. 2 #13</ref> including [[Bushmaster (Marvel Comics)#Quincy McIver|Bushmaster]], [[Gargoyle (comics)#Gargoyle (Isaac Christians)|Gargoyle]], [[Tiger Shark (Marvel Comics)|Tiger Shark]], [[Kangaroo (comics)#Kangaroo (Brian Hibbs)|Kangaroo]], [[Aragorn (comics)|Aragorn]], [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Vulture]], [[Man-Bull]], [[Dragon Man (comics)|Dragon Man]], [[Swarm (comics)|Swarm]], [[Mandrill (comics)|Mandrill]], [[Grizzly (comics)#Grizzly (Maxwell Markham)|Grizzly]], [[Frog-Man]], and [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]].<ref>''The Punisher War Journal'' vol. 2 #14</ref> In the end, the Punisher managed to sabotage this zoo, though Kraven himself escaped to the [[Savage Land]].<ref>''The Punisher War Journal'' vol. 2 #15</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nGenetic engineering by the [[High Evolutionary]] granted Mongoose superhuman strength, speed, stamina, agility, and reflexes. He is an excellent hand-to-hand combatant utilizing his superhuman speed and cunning to create his own unique fighting style.\n\nThe Mongoose wears artificial claws on his gloves, and uses gas pellets (causing dizziness and disorientation), and a wrist device used to project concussive blasts. He has also carried a cellsmograph, a device for determining the presence of a living being by identifying its genetic structure. He also has access to the advanced sky-craft and land vehicles of Wundagore, and once used a Wundagorian \"asteroid blaster\" to attack Thor.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.marvel.com/universe/Mongoose Mongoose] at Marvel.com\n\n{{Thor}}\n\n[[Category:Characters created by Ron Frenz]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Tom DeFalco]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1988]]\n[[Category:Fictional genetically engineered characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional mongooses]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters who can move at superhuman speeds]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters with superhuman strength]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]"}]}}}}
