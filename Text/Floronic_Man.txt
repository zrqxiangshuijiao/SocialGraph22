The Floronic Man tries to warn Sunderland that the Swamp Thing is not dead, but the General refuses to listen and announces his intent to terminate Woodrue's employment. Subsequently, the Floronic Man traps Sunderland in his office with a thawed and enraged Swamp Thing, who kills the General.<ref name=secret23/>\n\nIn ''The Saga of the Swamp Thing'' (vol. 2) #22 (March 1984), the Floronic Man uses the Swamp Thing's body\u2014now regressing to a plant-like state due to his inability to accept the new revelation about his origins, Woodrue literally eating parts of him\u2014to contact the Green, which is composed of the life force of all plants on Earth. The experience drives the Floronic Man insane; he refers to himself as \"Wood-Rue\", and sets out to destroy all non-plant life on Earth by forcing the plants to produce an excess amount of oxygen to force humans and animals into extinction, in the belief that he is \"saving\" Earth from mankind. Woodrue is confronted by a revived Swamp Thing, who reveals to the Green that plants cannot survive without humans and animals, as his actions would deprive them of the carbon dioxide that ''they'' require to breathe that comes from humans and animals, forcing Woodrue to acknowledge that his actions are the actions of a man rather than a plant. The Green abandons the Floronic Man, who is then taken into custody by the Justice League after undergoing a complete mental breakdown.<ref name=secret23/><ref>''The Saga of the Swamp Thing'' (vol. 2) #24 (May 1984).

The character Philip Sylvian, apparently unaware of Woodrue's transformation, refers to him as a \"poor old guy\" and states: \"Last I heard he was in Arkham ''Insane'' Asylum...\"\n\nThe Floronic Man was briefly a hero after the events of ''[[Millennium (comics)|Millennium]]'', which led to him to become a member of the [[New Guardians]]. In this new role, Woodrue takes on the name '''Floro'''. After the death of most of his teammates, he reverts to his original status as a villain.\n\n[[Image:FloroIvy.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Poison Ivy discovers that the Floronic Man has broken her out of Arkham Asylum. From ''[[Batman: Shadow of the Bat]]'' #57 (December 1996). Art by [[Dave Taylor (comics)|Dave Taylor]].]]\nThe Floronic Man returns in ''Batman: Shadow of the Bat'' #56 (November 1996). After breaking [[Poison Ivy (character)|Poison Ivy]] out of Arkham with his two underlings Holly and Eva, the Floronic Man explains his past to the [[Batman]] and Poison Ivy, telling the story of how he prevented a plot of the Swamp Thing's, only to be killed soon. After scientists manage to keep his head alive, the first thing he comes in contact with is marijuana. Regenerating a plant body, he begins his quest to flood the streets of Gotham City with his advanced and cheap pot. The Floronic Man takes some of Poison Ivy's DNA in an attempt to create a \"child\". Poison Ivy, in exchange, gets a trunk full of dope money, and is free to walk away. Deciding that she does not want the Floronic Man running the world, she frees the Batman. After a short battle, the Batman notices that the Floronic Man is standing in a puddle, and uses an electrical cable to electrocute the villain, then kills him once again.\n\nThe character has since appeared in various other comics and storylines. He assists [[Starman (Jack Knight)|Starman]], [[Alan Scott]], the Batman and others in trying to save a friendly, peaceful version of [[Solomon Grundy (character)|Solomon Grundy]].<ref>''Starman'' (vol. 2) #33\u201335 (August\u2013October 1997). DC Comics.</ref> In a recent issue of ''[[Batman]]'', he is killed after assassins shoot him repeatedly with bullets, although this is in direct contrast to his most famous appearance (in ''The Saga of the Swamp Thing'' #21) in which he points out that \"you can't kill a vegetable by shooting it through the head\".  He is one of the many villains who was mind-wiped by the JLA, but he has since recovered those memories.<ref>''JLA'' #115\u2013119 (August\u2013November 2005).

DC Comics.</ref> Woodrue is later revealed to be '''the Seeder''', now endowed with power by the Parliament of Trees. The Swamp Thing had been hunting him for disrupting the balance of the Green. The Parliament of Trees decides that he and the Swamp Thing must fight, once they have fully realized their powers, to decide who shall be the champion of the Green.<ref>''Swamp Thing'' (vol. 5) #24 (Dec. 2013). DC Comics.</ref> As he did in his previous incarnation, he briefly takes the powers of the Swamp Thing, becoming the Champion of the Green, before the Swamp Thing tricks him from within the Green and steals back the title, which nearly kills the Seeder, until the Swamp Thing places him within the Green to save him. He later re-emerges to fight alongside the Swamp Thing against the combined forces of the Metal, the Gray/Fungi and the Rot. He fights the Avatar of the Gray, resulting in both of their deaths.\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nIn his original form, Jason Woodrue has advanced knowledge of botany, which he uses it to accelerate [[plant growth]]. After becoming the Floronic Man, Woodrue gained the ability to merge with and mentally control plant life.<ref>''Who's Who: The Definitive Directory of the DC Universe'' Vol 1 #8 (October 1985)</ref> When he ate the Swamp Thing's \"[[organs]]\", this power had been expanded, allowing him to manipulate plants all over the world for a time. Unfortunately, these capabilities were lost, thanks to the Swamp Thing.<ref>''Swamp Thing'' Vol 5 #27 (March 2014)</ref>\n\n==In other media==\n===Television===\n* A character loosely based on Jason Woodrue's Plant Master appearance appears in an episode of the \"Atom\" segment of ''[[The Superman/Aquaman Hour of Adventure]]'' called \"The Plant Master\", voiced by [[Ted Knight]]. Straal is a scientist who has discovered a way to use wave patterns with plant growths. When a plane carrying members of Ivy University science faculty lands on his island as part of a plan to establish a research center, the Plant Master uses his special plants to knock them out and have his henchmen capture them. When the Atom arrives, he takes out the Plant Master's henchmen before being captured by the Plant Master and his pet cat. The Plant Master then places the Atom in a container where he is strangled by living grass that the Plant Master activated. With some unknowing help from the Plant Master's cat, the Atom was able to defeat the Plant Master, where he and his henchmen are arrested by the Coast Guard.\n* Dr. Woodrue is referenced several times in the 1990s ''[[Swamp Thing: The Series|Swamp Thing]]'' [[television series]]. In this incarnation, he is a scientist that is a rival of [[Anton Arcane|Dr. Arcane]]. He invented some sort of method to \"grow\" human life by artificial means.\n* In ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'' episode \"The Flash of Two Worlds\", the [[Sand Demon]] captures [[Patty Spivot]] and brings her to a place called the \"Woodrue Greenhouse\", referencing the Floronic Man.\n* [[Kevin Durand]] portrays Dr. Woodrue in the [[DC Universe (streaming service)|DC Universe]] series ''[[Swamp Thing (2019 TV series)|Swamp Thing]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2018/11/dc-universe-lost-actor-kevin-durand-joins-swamp-thing-1202499529/|title=DC Universe: 'Lost' Actor Kevin Durand Joins 'Swamp Thing' As Villain|last=Boucher|first=Geoff|work=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date=November 12, 2018|access-date=November 16, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181112225353/https://deadline.com/2018/11/dc-universe-lost-actor-kevin-durand-joins-swamp-thing-1202499529/|archive-date=November 12, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> This version of him is a scientist who is married and seeks to use the swamp of Marais properties for his own needs to cure his wife Carolyn's Alzheimer's disease. He soon finds himself drawn to the emergence of the Swamp Thing thanks to his work with Avery Sunderland backing him. When at the Conclave facility, Woodrue deduces and reveals to him that he is not Alec Holland but a humanoid plant that absorbed Holland's memories after the explosion that killed Holland. After the Swamp Thing is freed by Abby Arcane and Liz Tremayne with some help from [[Blue Devil (DC Comics)|Blue Devil]], Woodrue escapes with organs. Later, he experiments on himself, eating the remains of the Swamp Thing to try before having Carolyn eat, but is interrupted by Abby and arrested by Marias police. In the episode \"Loose Ends\", Woodrue experiments on himself in his latest plan to save his wife. In the post-credits scene, [[Matt Cable]] encounters Woodrue in a broken cell surrounded by plants, and Woodrue is transformed into the Floronic Man as he attacks Matt.\n\n===Film===\n[[Image:JasonWoodrue-johnglover.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Jason Woodrue, played by [[John Glover (actor)|John Glover]], as seen in ''[[Batman & Robin (film)|Batman & Robin]]''.]]\n* An unmutated Jason Woodrue appears in the 1997 film ''[[Batman & Robin (film)|Batman & Robin]]'', portrayed by [[John Glover (actor)|John Glover]]. He is depicted as a [[Wayne Enterprises]] mad scientist operating in the [[Amazon rainforest]] who uses plant toxins to grant superhuman abilities to [[Bane (comics)|Bane]] as part of his \"[[Gilgamesh]] project\" with a super soldier serum named Venom. When Woodrue's assistant, Pamela Isley, discovers the criminal nature of his experiments, he throws her into a shelf filled with various unspecified chemicals including Venom, which grants her superhuman abilities of her own. Taking on the identity of Poison Ivy, she then kills Woodrue with a poison kiss, while escaping with Bane while the lab burns.\n* The Floronic Man was reportedly featured in [[David S. Goyer]]'s script for an unproduced [[Green Arrow]] film project entitled ''[[Green Arrow in other media#Escape from Super Max|Escape from Super Max]]''. In the script, the Floronic Man appeared as an inmate of the Super Max Penitentiary for Metahumans.<ref name=\"SuperMax\">{{cite web|url=http://latinoreview.com/news/supermax-green-arrow-story-details-villains-inmates-gallery-4673|title=Supermax: Green Arrow Story Details + Villains/Inmates Gallery|last=Mayimbe|first=El|work=LatinoReview.com|date=May 19, 2008|access-date=April 2, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013133359/http://latinoreview.com/news/supermax-green-arrow-story-details-villains-inmates-gallery-4673|archive-date=October 13, 2008|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n* The Floronic Man was also planned to appear as the main villain in [[Guillermo del Toro]]'s ''[[Justice League Dark#Film|Justice League Dark]]''.<ref>[http://collider.com/justice-league-dark-details-guillermo-del-toro/ Guillermo del Toro Talks JUSTICE LEAGUE DARK, Reveals another Character on the Team, the Status of the Screenplay, and More]</ref>\n* The Floronic Man appears as the primary antagonist in the film ''[[Batman and Harley Quinn]]'', voiced by [[Kevin Michael Richardson]].\n\n=== Miscellaneous ===\nThe [[DCAU]] version of Dr. Jason Woodrue (as the Floronic Man) is seen among the villains in the comic ''[[Justice League Adventures]]'' (based on the ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' TV series).<ref>''Justice League Adventures'' #6</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://dc.fandom.com/wiki/Jason_Woodrue Floronic Man] at DC Database\n*[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/floronic-man/4005-24969/ Floronic Man] at Comic Vine\n\n{{Swamp Thing}}\n{{The Atom}}\n{{Justice League Dark}}\n{{Harley Quinn}}\n{{Gardner Fox}}\n\n[[Category:DC Comics aliens]]\n[[Category:DC Comics metahumans]]\n[[Category:DC Comics characters who are shapeshifters]]\n[[Category:DC Comics characters with accelerated healing]]\n[[Category:DC Comics plant characters]]\n[[Category:DC Comics extraterrestrial supervillains]]\n[[Category:DC Comics male supervillains]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters who can duplicate themselves]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters with immortality]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters with plant abilities]]\n[[Category:Fictional mad scientists]]\n[[Category:Fictional mass murderers]]\n[[Category:Fictional scientists]]\n[[Category:Fictional cannabis users]]\n[[Category:Superhero film characters]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1962]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Gil Kane]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Gardner Fox]]"}]}}}}
