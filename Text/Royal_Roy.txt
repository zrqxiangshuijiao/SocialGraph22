It was created by [[Lennie Herman]] and [[Warren Kremer]].\n\n==Publication history==\n''Royal Roy'' began in April 1985 as an answer to the successful [[Harvey Comics]] ''[[Richie Rich (comics)|Richie Rich]]'' series.  Its title character was the young Prince Roy of Cashelot, a fictional [[monarchy|kingdom]] whose name was a [[portmanteau]] of \"[[cash]]\" and \"[[Camelot]]\".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Markstein |first1=Don |website=Don Markstein's Toonopedia |accessdate=2 April 2020  |url=http://www.toonopedia.com/royalroy.htm |title=Royal Roy}}</ref> Like Richie, Roy was surrounded by wealth and luxury but wasn't spoiled by it; in many ways, he was just like any other young boy. Also like Richie, Roy had a sweet-natured middle-class girlfriend (Crystal Cleer) and a wealthy, abrasive acquaintance (Lorna Loot) who vied for his affections.\n\nIn late 1985 Harvey Comics sued Star Comics for copyright infringement, claiming that Royal Roy was a blatant copy of Richie Rich.<ref>\"Harvey Sues Marvel Star Comics, Charges Copyright Infringement,\" ''The Comics Journal'' #105 (Feb. 1986), pp. 23-24.</ref> (Longtime Harvey creator Lennie Herman had created ''Royal Roy'' for Star Comics; Herman died in 1983<ref>\"Harvey Veteran Lenny Herman Dies,\" ''The Comics Journal'' #87 (December 1983), p. 21.</ref> before the first issue of ''Royal Roy'' was published. Artist Warren Kremer, the co-creator, was also the co-creator of Richie Rich.)\n\n''Royal Roy'' was cancelled after six issues in March 1986, and Harvey's lawsuit was dropped.\n\n===''X-Babies''===\nAn updated version of Royal Roy (along with [[Planet Terry]], [[Top Dog (comics)|Top Dog]], and [[Wally the Wizard]]) is featured in the four-issue ''[[X-Babies]]'' miniseries published by [[Marvel Comics]] in late 2009.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.toonopedia.com/royalroy.htm Royal Roy] at [[Don Markstein's Toonopedia]].
