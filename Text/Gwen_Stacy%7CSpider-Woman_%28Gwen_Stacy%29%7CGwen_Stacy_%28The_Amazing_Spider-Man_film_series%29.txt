This flashback confirms the [[Green Goblin]]'s real motivations for the murder: he clearly states that Gwen \"is just a pawn\", contradicting the whole core of ''Sins Past'' in which Osborn wanted to kill her to keep the twins with him and silence her forever.

After the death of [[Falcon (comics)|the Falcon]] (which mirrors how Gwen died in the main continuity), she was trained by [[Nighthawk (Marvel Comics)|Nighthawk]] and became the vigilante known as '''Nightbird'''. She briefly dated Flash Thompson for a time, but her refusal to be with him drove him to be insane and become the second Jackal. She also appears to have a close relationship with [[Misty Knight]].<ref>''Heroes Reborn: Night-Gwen'' #1.

Instead, she married Peter Parker, and the couple had a young son. She had become a scientist, a savvy businesswoman, and a peace activist \u2013 and had a decidedly hostile relationship with chemical weapon developer [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]]. Mary Jane Watson, a popular actress in this reality, played Gwen Stacy in the film adaptation of Spider-Man's life story. Gwen and her father read textual accounts of their deaths in the main universe, though they believe this simply to be the morbid imaginings of Peter Parker, who is suffering from mental health issues.<ref>''Spider-Man: House of M'' #1-3 (2005).

However, the Torinos continued to harass Gwen at Midtown, prompting Spider-Man to help the police take down the gang.<ref>''Marvel Adventures Spider-Man'' #55.

She is also a member of a band fronted by Mary Jane Watson, simply called the Mary Janes. Shortly after Gwen begins fighting crime, Peter Parker, her best friend attempts to exact revenge on those who bullied him, becoming this universe's version of the [[Lizard (comics)|Lizard]]. Gwen subdues him, but Peter dies towards the end of the battle due to the chemical he used. Spider-Woman is blamed for his death, causing an outcry for her arrest, led by [[J. Jonah Jameson]]. Her father, who is also a police chief in this world, begins a hunt for her. This follows Gwen into college, where she is still a member of the Mary Janes. At a gig of theirs, an assassin is sent after Gwen's father, who is in the audience. Gwen defeats the assassin, the audience and band clearing out during the battle. While they are alone, Captain Stacy holds Spider-Woman at gun point, with Gwen taking off her mask to reveal who she is. Shocked upon learning Spider-Woman's identity, he tells her to run before he changes his mind.

She eventually marries Peter and becomes Chief Biologist for Miles Warren's bio-engineering company. In 1977, Harry Osborn's attack on Warren's company as the Black Goblin revealed that Miles created clones of Norman Osborn, Peter, and Gwen. Harry blows up the containment tubes containing the clones which kills all of them except for Peter's clone. However, Miles reveals that the \"Gwen\" Peter was with was actually her clone; he abducted the real Gwen with the intention of attempting to win her over later, with the result that the real Gwen died in the explosion. A year later, Peter and Gwen's clones rename themselves as Ben and Helen Parker and move out of New York for a second chance at life, the clone's relationship with the original Peter apparently not surviving the revelation of her clone status.<ref>''Spider-Man: Life Story'' #1-2</ref>\n\nShe and Ben eventually split up and she renamed herself Helen Carroll.

Gwen becomes friends with Peter, which leads Mary Jane Watson to believe she is vying for his affections.{{issue|date=July 2013}}\n\nGwen is later taken in by [[Ultimate Aunt May|Aunt May]] after her father, police captain John Stacy, is killed by a burglar wearing a Spider-Man costume and her estranged mother does not want to take her in. Her living in the Parker house creates more tension between Peter and Mary Jane, and leads to their temporary break-up. Peter's relationship with Gwen is further complicated by her hatred of Spider-Man, whom she blames for her father's death. When Peter finds his friend [[Eddie Brock]], Gwen confides in him about her feelings of isolation. Eddie then tries to kiss her and Gwen is shocked.{{issue|date=July 2013}} When she eventually learns Peter is Spider-Man, the angry Gwen pulls her father's gun on him. He manages to convince her he is not to blame for her father's death. Gwen runs off but returns, explaining she is just really mad at everything at the moment. She wouldn't have really shot him, a fact Peter already knew because his spider sense didn't go off despite Gwen's wrath. Gwen then agrees to keep his secret.{{issue|date=July 2013}}\n\nGwen Stacy dies in ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #62. Before her death, she made peace with Mary Jane and assured her she never had romantic feelings for Peter. She considered him just as a friend. She is killed by [[Carnage (comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Carnage]], a symbiotic which is the offspring of the Venom symbiote. Although Peter is not in the area when she dies, he still feels some responsibility for her death, as he allowed Dr. Connors to use his genetic material for experimentation. His guilt makes him decide to retire as Spider-Man for a while. Eventually, he takes up his hero identity when his responsibility for the innocent becomes too great to overlook.{{issue|date=July 2013}} At the end of the arc, there was an issue that dealt with Gwen's death. [[Flash Thompson#Ultimate Marvel|Flash Thompson]] makes an off-color remark about Gwen's passing. It infuriates MJ to the point where she physically attacks Flash. It is revealed Flash had a crush on Gwen all along.{{issue|date=July 2013}}\n\nA girl seeming to be Gwen Stacy appears in ''Ultimate Spider-Man #98''.

She transforms into what appears to be Carnage before leaping out the window.{{issue|date=July 2013}} In the next issue, \"[[Dr. Richard Parker|Richard Parker]]\" claims \"Gwen\" should not have met Peter at all, and was merely an experiment in [[stem cell research]]. This Gwen/Carnage fights with the Fantastic Four, Nick Fury, and the Spider-Slayer drones, until she is knocked unconscious by a beam of light, and taken into custody. In issue #113, Norman Osborn as the Green Goblin causes a massive prison break from the Triskelion. An inmate appearing to be 'Gwen' walks out amidst the chaos, disappearing in the shadows. It has been revealed the creature posing as Gwen Stacy is still the original Ultimate Carnage Spider-Man faced earlier in its run. After \"devouring\" Gwen, this incarnation of Carnage has gone on to mimic her \"essence\" and now believes itself to be Gwen Stacy.{{dead link|date=August 2013}}<ref>[http://www.ign.com/comics/ultimate-spider-man \"Ultimate Spider-Man Pictures Full Size\"]. [[IGN]].</ref>\n\nDuring the \"War of the Symbiotes\" storyline, Gwen/Carnage's back story in the Triskelion is revealed. It is shown Gwen has been taking some form of therapy with Tony Stark. However, when the Green Goblin broke out of the Triskelion, Gwen escaped and went to Peter Parker's house in a confused and terrified state, with Carnage's face on her body. During an exchange between Peter and Gwen, Eddie Brock attempts to attack Aunt May and retake his symbiote. In a rage, Spider-Man engages Venom on a nearby rooftop. During the fight, Gwen is shown to be able to use her symbiote to fight off Eddie but Eddie reabsorbs his symbiote along with the Carnage symbiote rendering Gwen Stacy an average girl. After a series of tests, it is concluded that this Gwen is not a clone but consciously and genetically is the original now reborn (though Gwen's original body died, the Carnage symbiote absorbed her being and they had bonded since her death). After S.H.I.E.L.D. intervenes, S.H.I.E.L.D. Director Danvers states Gwen will remain in S.H.I.E.L.D. custody. Peter and May argue for her to come back to live with them, with Tony Stark supporting the Parkers. In ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #129, the Parkers are now helping to rebuild Gwen's life. Her ghastly experience with the Carnage symbiote also causes her to develop a death anxiety she gradually controls. Six months after the \"Ultimatum\" storyline, in ''Ultimate Comics Spider-Man'' #1, Gwen is living with the Parkers again and is dating Peter after MJ broke up with him. However, circumstances involving the Chameleon made Gwen realize that Peter and MJ are still in love, and believes that they shouldn't be together, even if she wants to be with him. She breaks up with him, but vows to be his loyal friend. She also continues to live with the Parkers due to Gwen and Aunt May having become close in a surrogate mother-daughter fashion.\n\nAfter Peter's death, Gwen and May re-locate to France but return to New York after hearing about the re-emergence of a [[Spider-Man (Miles Morales)|new Spider-Man]], Miles Morales.<ref>''Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man'' #11.

They even attack him, as they believe he is trying to imposter their Peter.<ref>''Spider-Men'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> It is only through his mannerisms similar to Peter and his choice of words that they believe that he is not an imposter.

In it, Peter returns to the role of Spider-Man and Gwen is possibly still living with Aunt May.\n\nEarly in the series, ''Ultimate Spider-Man #25'' (October 2002) paid homage to Gwen Stacy's death in the [[Earth-616]] continuity, although Gwen herself was not involved. The Green Goblin tossed Mary Jane off the [[Queensboro Bridge]]. Spider-Man caught her leg with his webbing, just as with Gwen. The issue ended with a cliffhanger: when Spider-Man pulled Mary Jane up, she appeared to be either unconscious or dead.

At first, thinking that this Gwen was a clone, she later learned that this Gwen was actually a superhero, but when trying to get more information, Spider-Gwen fled in a rage. She learned that Spider-Gwen's father had been put in a coma, which caused her rage, then Gwen helped her counterpart to come to epiphany that she should treasure that she still has her father alive in contrast to her, whose father had died. After that, Gwen with the help of [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]] and [[Hank Pym]] of this reality, successfully send Spider-Gwen to her timeline. After this encounter, Gwen was inspired to become a detective and bonded to the [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom symbiote]] of her reality to become [[Spider-Woman]].

Harry, alongside Gwen Stacy as this universe's [[Alternative versions of Green Goblin#Spider-Geddon|Green Goblin]], started to fight crime together, where they even took down Vulture. This lasted until a fight with the Sandman where both Harry and George Stacy were killed. The accident did something to the circuitry that enabled Gwen to control the Goblin Glider that left her mostly acting like the Green Goblin, with no memory of being Gwen Stacy.

She was portrayed by [[Emma Stone]] in the films ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man (2012 film)|The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' and ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man 2]]''. As opposed to taking a supporting role in the [[Spider-Man (2002 film series)|previous film trilogy]], Gwen is given a prominent role in Webb's films as one of [[Peter Parker (The Amazing Spider-Man film series)|Peter Parker]]'s classmates, serving as his primary love interest and a [[foil (fiction)|foil]] to his character. Webb based Gwen's character off of her traditional comic-book portrayal. For her performance in the films, Stone has received critical praise and wider recognition, despite the divided response to the film series as a whole.\n\n==Character development and execution==\n===Origins and casting===\nThe character of Gwen Stacy first appeared in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #31 in 1965. Intended to be [[Spider-Man]]'s primary love interest, she was soon superseded in popularity by [[Mary Jane Watson]] in that role by fans. This eventually led to the now-controversial decision by Spider-Man writers to [[The Night Gwen Stacy Died|kill off Gwen]], which served as one of the most pivotal moments in comic-book history; Spider-Man's failure to save Gwen was one of the first big failures by a superhero, and is regarded as the end of the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]].<ref name=\"Blumberg\">{{cite journal| last = Blumberg| first = Arnold T.| date = Fall 2003| title = 'The Night Gwen Stacy Died:' The End of Innocence and the Birth of the Bronze Age| journal = Reconstruction| volume = 3| issue = 4| url = http://reconstruction.eserver.org/034/blumberg.htm| access-date = 2008-11-14| url-status = dead| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100116034408/http://reconstruction.eserver.org/034/blumberg.htm| archive-date = 2010-01-16}}</ref> The character has subsequently been cloned or revived several times or seen different iterations in the comics, including one as [[Spider-Woman (Gwen Stacy)|Spider-Gwen]], and has been included in several television shows and cartoons based on Spider-Man.\n\nThe first big-budget cinematic appearance of Gwen Stacy was in ''[[Spider-Man 3]]'', with [[Bryce Dallas Howard]] portraying the character in a supporting role, as Mary Jane was already serving as Peter's main love interest in that trilogy. Following the cancellation of ''Spider-Man 4'' and reboot of the Spider-Man film series, it was originally reported that both Gwen and Mary Jane would appear in the first film  of the new series before Gwen was confirmed as the only one of Peter's love interests to appear.<ref name=\"Sperling\">{{cite magazine|url=http://insidemovies.ew.com/2010/09/23/spider-man-female-leads-theyre-getting-closer/|title='Spider-Man' female leads: they're getting closer|magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]| last=Sperling| first=Nicole|date=September 23, 2010|access-date=September 23, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Sneider|first=Jeff|url=https://www.thewrap.com/deal-central/column-post/martin-sheen-play-uncle-ben-sonys-spider-man-reboot-22295|title=Martin Sheen & Sally Field in Talks to Raise 'Spider-Man'|publisher=TheWrap.com|date=November 4, 2010|access-date=November 6, 2010}}</ref> The shortlist of actresses to play the role included [[Lily Collins]], [[Ophelia Lovibond]], and [[Imogen Poots]], with [[Teresa Palmer]], [[Emma Roberts]], and [[Mary Elizabeth Winstead]], as reported by ''The Hollywood Reporter'' as \"potentially in the mix\".<ref>{{cite news|last=Rome|first=Emily|url=http://heatvision.hollywoodreporter.com/2010/08/spiderman-marc-webb-imogen-poots-lilly-collins-ophelia-lovibond-teresa-palmer-emma-roberts.html| title=Will one of these women be Spider-Man's love interest?

She breaks up a fight between the two, admonishing Flash for not finishing his homework and for beating up Peter, then later commends the latter for standing up to Flash. Peter and Gwen begin to develop a mutual interest in each other from that point onwards. They encounter each other later at [[Oscorp]], where Gwen is interning as a research assistant, as Peter sneaks into the facility to find [[Lizard (comics)|Dr. Curt Connors]] and is later bitten by a radioactive spider that gives him new abilities. Gwen catches up with Peter after his [[Uncle Ben]] picks him up following after-school detention, and later consoles Peter after Ben's death.\n\nAfter Peter starts tracking down Ben's killer as a masked vigilante, Gwen invites him to dinner with her family, where Peter and Captain Stacy argue about the vigilante's motives. Afterwards, Peter reveals to her that he is, in fact, the vigilante, sharing a kiss with her. Gwen also plays a crucial part in the Lizard's defeat; having helped Peter develop an antidote for Connors' serum for turning people into reptilian hybrids using her own scientific knowledge. Unfortunately, her father is killed by the Lizard before Peter can defeat the villain. George makes Peter promise to keep Gwen out of his dangerous life. Peter honors that vow without immediately telling Gwen, which offends her until she realizes what her father did and forgives Peter. However, when Peter later hints that he's reconsidering keeping that vow, she quietly smiles at this development.\n\n===''The Amazing Spider-Man 2'' (2014)===\n{{main|The Amazing Spider-Man 2}}\nTwo years later, Gwen and Peter are graduating from high school. She calls him, telling him that he'll be \"late\" to the graduation ceremony while unbeknownst to her, he is in action as Spider-Man helping the NYPD apprehend [[Rhino (character)|Aleksei Sytsevich]]. Peter arrives just after Gwen finishes her speech as [[valedictorian]] to collect his diploma, kissing her in front of the crowd. Gwen and Peter talk where she invites him to dinner before she was called by her mother for a family photo. Later in the evening, Peter tells Gwen about the visions of her father he's been having and insists that he needs to keep his promise which as a result, Gwen breaks up with Peter.\n\nGwen is seen then working at Oscorp and meets [[Max Dillon (film character)|Max Dillon]] in an elevator, where she finds out his birthday and the fact that he is obsessed with Spider-Man. She later meets up with Peter again, in which they try to maintain their friendship and establish some \"ground rules\". Gwen tells Peter that she is trying to apply for a scholarship to [[Oxford University]], meaning she has to move to [[England]] if she gets it. Before the two can discuss it, Max, having suffered an industrial accident and become Electro, shuts off the power to Times Square whilst looking for electricity to power himself. Gwen recognizes Max and starts asking questions; Donald Menken, a high ranking and mutinous Oscorp board member, decides that she is a threat, fires her and targets her for elimination. In the chaos, she also encounters Peter's childhood best friend [[Harry Osborn (The Amazing Spider-Man film series)|Harry Osborn]].\n\nGwen later leaves Peter a voicemail, saying that she got the position at Oxford and has to leave early for a flight. Peter catches up to her and declares his love for her, agreeing to accompany her to England. They are interrupted by an intentional blackout caused by Electro. Peter takes Gwen down where the police are and Gwen helps him with his web-shooters to go against Electro. Peter heads off to fight with Electro having the upper-hand. As Electro has Spider-Man in the air and is electrocuting him, Gwen comes in a police car and hits Electro, against Peter's demands. The two defeat and kill Electro by [[overcurrent|overloading]] his electricity supply.\n\nJust after they do so, Harry arrives, now as the [[Green Goblin]], having figured out Spider-Man's identity and wanting revenge for being refused a potentially life-saving blood transfusion. Goblin takes Gwen to a clock tower and drops her but Spider-Man catches her. The two fight at the top of the tower, and Spider-Man manages to subdue the Goblin. However, during the fight, Gwen falls and is supported by a web connected to one of the gears. The gear soon gives away, which cuts the web and Gwen again plummets. Goblin is then defeated and Peter tries to save Gwen using his web. Though he successfully catches her inches from the ground, she dies nonetheless due to [[whiplash (medicine)|whiplash]] causing her head to hit the floor. Devastated by his failure to save Gwen, Peter ends his career as Spider-Man.\n\nFive months pass and Spider-Man is nowhere to be seen in New York as Peter spends every day at Gwen's grave. Later, an unknown team of men break Sytsevich out of prison. Equipped with an electromechanical suit of armor, Sytsevich dubs himself the \"Rhino\" and rampages through the streets. Peter, inspired by re-watching Gwen's graduation speech, resumes his role as Spider-Man and confronts him.\n\n===''Spider-Man: No Way Home'' (2021)===\n{{main|Spider-Man: No Way Home}}\nGwen does not appear in this film, but is heavily referenced.  After Peter is temporarily transported to [[Marvel Cinematic Universe|an alternate reality]], he reveals to [[Peter Parker (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|his alternate self]] that Gwen's death still haunts him and that he became more brutal while fighting crime.  Later on, Peter achieves his redemption when he manages to catch the other Peter's girlfriend [[MJ (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|MJ]] as she is falling, preventing her from meeting the same fate as Gwen. He returns to his universe as a happier and more optimistic man.\n\n==Comic appearances==\n===Marvel Infinite tie-in comics===\nGwen appears in comics that tie into both films in the series, helping Peter redesign his Spider-Man suit and attempting to maintain a friendship with him after their initial breakup before resuming their relationship.\n\n==In other media==\n===Video games===\n*This version of the character also appears in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man (2012 video game)|The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' movie video game, voiced by [[Kari Wahlgren]]. Several months after the film, Gwen continues to work at Oscorp, and occasionally provides assistance to Spider-Man.\n*Gwen Stacy does not appear in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (2014 video game)|The Amazing Spider-Man 2]]'' movie video game, but is mentioned by Peter Parker while speaking to his Aunt May when he excuses himself to leave the house and pretend to check up on Gwen during an attack on Oscorp (when in reality, she wasn't present at the incident). [[Beenox]] confirmed that the character was excluded from the plot so the game doesn't generate spoilers for the then-upcoming film.{{Source needed|date=October 2022}}\n\n==Reception==\nEmma Stone's performance as Gwen Stacy has received positive reviews and led to wider recognition for the actress, as she was nominated for several awards, winning \"Favorite Movie Actress\" at the [[2015 Kids' Choice Awards]]. Critics praised Stone's chemistry with [[Andrew Garfield]] in both ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' and ''The Amazing Spider-Man 2'', and the fact that her character was significantly more fleshed-out than the Gwen Stacy of the Sam Raimi trilogy.<ref>{{cite news | url= https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-amazing-spiderman-20120702,0,6500728.story | title= Review: 'The Amazing Spider-Man's' Peter and Gwen are super | work= Los Angeles Times | date=July 2, 2012 | access-date=July 2, 2012 | first = Kenneth | last=Turan | author-link = Kenneth Turan}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=2020-03-22 |title=Spider-Man: 5 Best Versions Of Gwen Stacy (& 5 Worst) |url=https://www.cbr.com/spider-man-best-worst-versions-gwen-stacy/ |access-date=2020-08-16 |website=CBR |language=en-US}}</ref> In a review of the first film, Stephanie Zacharek of [[Movieline]] wrote that she \"had no specific desire to see the series resuscitated.

The character debuted in ''[[Edge of Spider-Verse]]'' issue #2 as part of the 2014\u201315 \"[[Spider-Verse]]\" [[comic book]] storyline, leading to the ongoing series ''[[Spider-Gwen]]'' that began in 2015.\n\nSpider-Woman/Ghost-Spider is a [[Alternative versions of Spider-Man|variant]] of [[Spider-Man]] and an [[parallel universe (fiction)|alternate-universe version]] of Gwen Stacy.

The character's various enemies include Earth-65 versions of [[Kingpin (Matt Murdock)|Matt Murdock]] and [[Punisher|Frank Castle]].
