The character primarily appears in the \"[[Marvel Comics 2|MC2]]\" future of the [[Marvel Universe]]. He was created by [[Tom DeFalco]] and [[Pat Olliffe]] and first appeared in [[Spider-Girl (Mayday Parker)|''Spider-Girl'']] #2 (November [[1998 in comics|1998]]).\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nReilly Tyne is the son of [[Ben Reilly#MC2|Ben Reilly]] ([[Alternative versions of Spider-Man#MC2|Spider-Man]]'s clone) and Elizabeth Tyne. Before he reached his teens, his inherited powers began to manifest but brought with them clonal degeneration.  [[Kaine Parker#MC2|Kaine]], the degenerated first clone of Peter Parker, found him, and placed him within a regeneration tank to slow the process. Kaine's efforts were for two goals: to resurrect [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)#MC2|Daredevil]], who had previously died saving Kaine, and to heal Tyne. Kaine summoned the demon [[Zarathos#MC2|Zarathos]], which attempted to possess Tyne, but he was saved by the soul of Daredevil, who drove out Zarathos, although both Daredevil's soul and a piece of the demon remained within Tyne, and he was left with a demonic appearance and certain demonic abilities. Through meditation and concentration, Tyne eventually learned to project a human appearance, but he now looked to be in his twenties, almost twice his actual age. Following in both of Daredevil's paths, he studied law and became an attorney, while taking on a costume bearing a resemblance to Daredevil's and using his demonic abilities to fight crime as Darkdevil.  He apparently has access to at least some of Daredevil's memories, since he knows Spider-Man's secret identity.<ref>''Darkdevil'' #1-3</ref>\n\nDarkdevil has fought alongside [[Spider-Girl (Mayday Parker)|Spider-Girl]] several times, as well as the semi-retired Spider-Man. Neither Spider-Man nor Spider-Girl are aware of his genetic relation to them, but Darkdevil has hinted that he owes his existence to the original Daredevil, Spider-Man, and Kaine.<ref>''Spider-Girl'' #17</ref> Mary Jane noticed Reilly at [[Normie Osborn#MC2|Normie Osborn]] and [[Raptor (Marvel Comics)#Brenda Drago|Brenda Drago's]] wedding party and attempted to point out to her husband the boy that resembled him. [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]] cluelessly mentions that Reilly resembles [[Tobey Maguire]],<ref>''Spider-Girl'' #82</ref> a sly nod by writers to the fact that Maguire played [[Spider-Man in film|Spider-Man in four films]].\n\nWhen Doc Magus, [[Sorcerer Supreme#MC2|Sorcerer Supreme]] (successor to Doctor Strange), delved into Darkdevil's mind, he found it had three inhabitants: Reilly himself as a young teen, Daredevil, and Zarathos in the form of [[Ghost Rider]].<ref>''Last Hero Standing'' #1-5</ref>\n\nRecently he has been seen working alongside Kaine, going as far as to refer to the man as Uncle Kaine, thus confirming that he is fully aware of his relation to both Kaine, Spider-Girl and her father Peter Parker. During a clone debacle which resulted in there being two May Parkers (one being a [[Alternative versions of Venom#Mayhem (April Parker)|symbiote hybrid]]), Darkdevil assists Spider-Girl in her rescue attempt only to be confronted by the Goblin Queen and the clone Spider-Girl.<ref>''The Spectacular Spider-Girl'' #3-7</ref> Darkdevil was also present with the [[New Warriors#New Warriors (MC2)|New Warriors]] and [[American Dream (comics)|American Dream]] battling Silvio Barraca/Silverback.<ref>''The Spectacular Spider-Girl'' vol. 2 #4</ref>\n\nAfter the [[Spider-Verse]] event, Darkdevil was later seen with the New Warriors (and [[Uncle Ben#Spider-Verse|Uncle Ben/Spider-Man of Earth-3145]]) on helping Spider-Girl (now known as Spider-Woman) stopping [[Hope Pym|Hope Pym/Red Queen]] and Entralla by freeing mind controlled A-Next. During the battle, Entralla's powers were uneffective to Darkdevil, due to his own demonic powers, and Mayday Parker/Spider-Woman is aware of her family relations with Reilly Tyne/Darkdevil, as she referred to him as [[cousin|\"coz\"]].<ref>''Spider-Island'' #4-5 (2015)</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nDarkdevil possesses augmented levels of strength, speed, agility and reflexes, along with the ability to cling to solid surfaces. He also possesses an ability similar to Spider-Man\u2019s spider-sense which allows him to detect immediate danger to himself. Due to his connection with the demon Zarathos, who is imprisoned in his body, he can also teleport, change his appearance from demon to human, manifest flaming constructs, such as billy clubs, and the ability to turn any part of his body into flame. Darkdevil is also an excellent hand-to-hand combatant and free style fighter, due to his link to the original Daredevil's soul. In his civilian guise as Reilly Tyne, he is also a skilled and respected lawyer, much like Daredevil's alter-ego: Matt Murdock.\n\n==Bibliography==\n*''Darkdevil'' #1\u20133 (Marvel Comics, Nov. 2000\u2013Jan. 2001)\n* ''[[Last Hero Standing]]'' #1\u20135 (Marvel Comics, 2005)\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060426223712/http://daredevil.dreamhost.com/darkdev.htm Darkdevil biography] at DD Resource\n* [http://www.angelfire.com/mi2/mc2/darkdevil.html Profile] at a Spider-girl fansite\n* [http://www.spiderfan.org/comics/title/darkdevil.html Synopsis and Reviews of ''Darkdevil'' miniseries] at spiderfan.org\n* {{Marveldatabase}}\n\n{{MC2}}\n{{Daredevil}}\n{{Spider-Man characters}}\n\n[[Category:Characters created by Tom DeFalco]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1998]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters with precognition]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics demons]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters who can move at superhuman speeds]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters who can teleport]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters with superhuman strength]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics mutates]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics superheroes]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics titles]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics 2]]"}]}}}}
