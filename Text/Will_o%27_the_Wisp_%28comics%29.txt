A former employee at [[Roxxon Energy Corporation|Roxxon Oil]], he worked in the division dedicated to electromagnetic research as a scientist. Under constant pressure of being fired, Arvad spent much time furthering his work on electromagnetism, getting little sleep in the process. He eventually ended up falling asleep on the job, unable to save himself from a laboratory accident that would change his life.\n\nHe ended up being caught in the electromagnetic field of a device he was working on, the device weakening the electromagnetic attraction between the molecules in his body, threatening his life. When his boss learned of the accident, he decided to let Arvad die, but not before he demanded any scientific applications the device would have had.\n\nHowever, Arvad was able to save himself when he learned he was suddenly able to control the level of attraction between his body's molecules.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Brevoort |first1=Tom |last2=DeFalco |first2=Tom |last3=Manning |first3=Matthew K. |last4=Sanderson |first4=Peter |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |title=Marvel Year By Year: A Visual History |date=2017 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1465455505 |page=209}}</ref>\n\nWill o' the Wisp was forced by his employer, [[Jonas Harrow]], to carry out criminal activities.

This enables him to vary the density of his body to make part, or all, of his body intangible or rock hard similar to the synthezoid Vision. He also has superhuman strength at higher densities, and has superhuman speed and durability. Also, he has the ability of flight, and at subsonic speeds, Will-O'-The-Wisp appears to be nothing more than a glowing sphere. Will-O'-The-Wisp can also mesmerize people for a short period of time. Will-O'-The-Wisp can will the molecules of his body to oscillate at a small distance from his body, making him look like an ethereal glowing sphere.\n\nJackson Arvad is a brilliant scientist, especially in the field of electromagnetics, with a master's of science degree in electrical engineering.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://marvel.com/universe/Will-O%27-The-Wisp Will o' the Wisp] at Marvel.com\n* [http://marvel.wikia.com/wiki/Jackson_Arvad_(Earth-616) Will o' the Wisp] at Marvel Wiki\n* [https://comicvine.gamespot.com/will-o-the-wisp/4005-15406/ Will o' the Wisp] at Comic Vine\n* [http://www.marveldirectory.com/individuals/w/willothewisp.htm Will o' the Wisp at MarvelDirectory.com]\n{{Spider-Man characters}}\n{{Spider-Man}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Will O' The Wisp (Comics)}}\n[[Category:Characters created by Len Wein]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Ross Andru]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1977]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from Pennsylvania]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters with density control abilities]]\n[[Category:Fictional electrical engineers]]\n[[Category:Fictional physicists]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters with superhuman strength]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics mutates]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics superheroes]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]\n[[Category:Spider-Man characters]]"}]}}}}
