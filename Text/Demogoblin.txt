He was created by [[Gerry Conway]] and [[Sal Buscema]].{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nDemogoblin was originally an unnamed demon who inhabited [[Otherplace|Limbo]] and was banished there eons ago for unknown reasons. His essence was fused with the [[Hobgoblin (comics)|Hobgoblin]] ([[Jason Macendale]]) when Jason asked [[N'astirh]] for more power in exchange for his soul.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #147</ref> As a part of Hobgoblin, he infected [[Moon Knight]] with a demonic virus that would slowly mutate him,<ref>''Marc Spector: Moon Knight'' #33</ref> and fought the [[Ghost Rider (Daniel Ketch)|Ghost Rider]] and [[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|John Blaze]], eventually being defeated by Blaze's hellfire gun and Ghost Rider's mystical chain.<ref>''Ghost Rider'' vol. 3 #17</ref> Hobgoblin quickly realized being possessed by a demon was less than beneficial, and, thanks to the effects of the hellfire and mystical chain, managed to expel his demon half, creating the Demogoblin, a darker, mystical version of the Hobgoblin persona.<ref>''Web of Spider-Man'' #86-87</ref>\n\nDemogoblin believed himself to be on a holy mission, and killed everyone whom he deemed a sinner. However, his definition of sinner is extreme and excludes only children. He often tried to kill heroes and even holy men. He claimed that he was a member of a demonic group known as the \"Righteous\"\u2014demons who sought redemption for their sins as self-proclaimed servants of the Lord by exterminating other demons and destroying evil wherever they found it.\n\nOnce freed from the Hobgoblin, Demogoblin next fought and was defeated by [[Spider-Man]] and Macendale as the Hobgoblin.<ref>''Spider-Man'' #24</ref> He then joined with the [[Doppelganger (comics)|Spider-Man doppelganger]] and tried to kill the Hobgoblin, but they retreated under the sewer depths when opposed by Spider-Man, [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]], Ghost Rider, and Blaze.<ref>''Web of Spider-Man'' #93-96; ''Spirits of Vengeance'' #5</ref>\n\nDemogoblin then confronted Moon Knight, trying to possess his body, which was ravaged by Demogoblin's bloodlink virus from the previous confrontation with the Hobgoblin. Moon Knight was saved from the virus due to the intervention of Dr. Strange and Mr. Fantastic.<ref>''Moon Knight'' #45-46</ref>\n\nDuring the events of \"[[Maximum Carnage]]\", Demogoblin joined [[Carnage (comics)|Carnage]], [[Shriek (comics)|Shriek]], [[Carrion (comics)|Carrion]], and the Spider-Man doppelganger on their killing spree throughout Manhattan. He battled Spider-Man, Venom, [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]], [[Captain America]], [[Deathlok#Michael Collins|Deathlok]], [[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Cloak and Dagger]], and [[Firestar (Marvel Comics)|Firestar]]. He ultimately becomes repulsed by his comrades' internal feuding and decides to leave them, but he is apprehended by the collective of superheroes before he can make good on this decision.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #378-380; ''Spider-Man'' #35-37; ''Web of Spider-Man'' #101-103; ''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #201-203</ref>\n\nThe Demogoblin is destroyed by the vampire-hunter [[Blade (comics)|Blade]] while Blade is empowered by the [[Darkhold]],<ref>''Ghost Rider'' vol. 3 #40</ref> but those who had been killed by Blade are restored to life when the Darkhold's spell is reversed.<ref>''Spirits of Vengeance'' #13</ref>\n\nHe is summoned to [[San Francisco]] by a horde of goblins who held the city in their grip and intend to make Demogoblin their ruler. However, he regards the goblins as sinners of the worst sort, and so plays along with them only long enough to kill Charles Palentine, the man who had summoned the goblins to Earth, and seize from him the necklace used for the summoning. He then uses the necklace's near godlike power to kill all the goblins and destroys the necklace itself, thus saving the city.<ref>''Venom: The Enemy Within'' #2-3</ref>\n\nDemogoblin's physical form is killed in a final showdown with Hobgoblin, who has gained greater strength than before. He dies trying to save a child from collapsing debris inside a church, where he is crushed to death.<ref>''Spider-Man'' #47-49</ref>\n\nPost-mortem, the Demogoblin makes an appearance as a taunting hallucination of the heroic [[Green Goblin]], [[Phil Urich]], alongside hallucinations of the original Green Goblin and Hobgoblin.<ref>''Green Goblin'' #5</ref>\n\nDemogoblin returns in the [[Absolute Carnage]] event as \"Demagoblin\", bound to the recently sacrificed Shriek.<ref>''Absolute Carnage: Lethal Protectors'' #1 (2019)</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nDemogoblin is a demonic being, with numerous supernatural powers granted by magic. He is endowed with superhuman strength, stamina, agility, reflexes, and resistance to injury. He has a magical ability to mentally control and levitate his one-man miniature \"[[goblin glider]]\" composed of hellfire and propel it at high speeds. He can project hellfire from his hands. He can also summon demons from hell that will attack anyone he instructs to be destroyed.\n\nDemogoblin is able to mystically create \"pumpkin bombs\", similar to those of the Green Goblin or Hobgoblin. Orange pumpkin bombs are bombs that explode conventionally (albeit magical) as concussion and incendiary Jack O' Lanterns. Black pumpkin bombs cause their target to be overwhelmed by massive feelings of despair and helplessness. He also can create wraith-shaped smoke and gas-emitting bombs, and bat-shaped razor-edged throwing blades.\n\nApart from his physical and magical advantages, he is knowledgeable about military training and hand-to-hand combat absorbed from his time merged with the Hobgoblin. Although deranged, the Demogoblin is highly intelligent.\n\n==Reception==\n* In 2020, ''[[CBR.com]]'' ranked Demogoblin 4th in their \"10 Most Powerful Comic Book Villains With Demonic Origins\" list.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Avina |first=Anthony |date=2020-05-12 |title=10 Most Powerful Comic Book Villains With Demonic Origins |url=https://www.cbr.com/most-powerful-comic-book-villains-demonic-origins/ |access-date=2022-10-11 |website=CBR |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n==Other versions==\n=== Ultimate Marvel ===\nIn [[Ultimate Marvel]] universe, [[Mary Jane Watson]] becomes the Demogoblin, after being kidnapped from her bedroom by [[Kaine Parker|a facially disfigured clone of Peter Parker]] who is determined to give her powers so that she is no longer in danger from his enemies. He pumps in her bloodstream an unquantified amount of OZ, the drug responsible for the creation of the Green Goblin, Hobgoblin and also Spider-Man. Upon learning this, she becomes very angry and transforms into a huge, hairy, horned red goblin-type creature.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #101</ref>\n\nHowever, when the real Peter Parker and Spider-Woman show up, she calms down and resumes her original form, just in time for Peter (her ex) to render his evil clone unconscious. MJ is taken to the Fantastic Four's Baxter Building and when she wakes up, she is afraid and angry, causing another transformation, but when she spots the Peter clone who was in the building, she calms down once again and reverts to her normal self.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #104</ref> She is then given what is believed to be a cure to the effects of the OZ formula, yet the ordeal has left her badly traumatized, and she is shown to be affected by panic issues and haunted by the scarred visage of Peter's disfigured clone.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #105</ref>\n\nWhen MJ later gets angry as she watches Peter talking to Kitty, his ex-girlfriend, her hand starts to tremble and her fingernails briefly become claws but she calms down when Kitty takes off in anger, indicating that her cure might not be permanent or even complete.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #107</ref> Mary Jane also daydreams a scene where she's fighting against Spider-Man and the Fantastic Four in her mutant form, defeating them one by one.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #112</ref>\n\n=== Spider-Geddon ===\nIn the ''[[Spider-Geddon]]'' event, in ''Vault of Spiders'' #2, on Earth-11580, a version of Demogoblin is seen alongside [[Green Goblin]], [[Hobgoblin (comics)|Hobgoblin]] and [[Jack O'Lantern (Marvel Comics)|Jack O'Lantern]] during the Goblin Night. Under the orders of the [[Madelyne Pryor|Goblin Queen]], they try to kill [[Gwen Stacy]], but [[Alternative versions of Spider-Man#Spiders-Man (Earth-11580)|Spiders-Man]] arrives and defeats the Goblins.<ref>''Vault of Spiders'' #2.
