She is married to [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]] (a perennial sidekick to the Incredible [[Hulk]]) and was a best friend to [[Betty Ross]], the wife of Hulk's alter ego Bruce Banner. Marlo is also depicted as the human host of [[Death (Marvel Comics)|'''Lady Death''']].\n\nIn keeping with her introduction during a storyline in which the Hulk was involved with organized crime, Marlo's name combines the surnames of fictional detective [[Philip Marlowe]] (with the spelling changed to ''Marlo'', a top-1000 name for girls born in the 1960s and 1970s) and his creator [[Raymond Chandler]].\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nMarlo first appeared as an [[aerobics]] and [[human swimming|swimming]] instructor and was a love interest for the [[casino security]] enforcer \"Joe Fixit\", who was in reality the believed-dead Hulk living ''incognito''. His true identity was unknown to Marlo.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #347. Marvel Comics.</ref> She left him after she saw him appear to commit a brutal murder<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #355. Marvel Comics.</ref> but, after the Hulk reached out to her in a rare display of emotion, their relationship ended in a more amicable way.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #362. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nShe had later appeared as the girlfriend of [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]], who was Hulk's sidekick and best friend to the Hulk's alter ego Bruce Banner.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #375. Marvel Comics.</ref> She had met Rick while he was on a book tour promoting his memoir, ''Sidekick''. It was only when Rick, not knowing of Marlo's previous relationship with the Hulk, introduced her to Bruce and [[Betty Banner|Betty]], that Marlo discovered that Mr. Fixit was really the Hulk, and that Bruce was not merely Mr. Fixit's friend but his alter ego.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #376. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nShortly after this introduction\u2014Marlo assuring Betty that she had nothing to be jealous about as Bruce and Joe were two distinct people and Bruce had been unswervingly loyal to Betty\u2014the psychiatrist [[Doc Samson]] integrated the three personalities of the Hulk (green, gray, and Banner), resulting in a being that possessed a permanent Hulk body with Bruce's face and intelligence. When Betty expressed skepticism of a continued relationship with this new version of her husband, she moved in with Marlo, with whom she became best friends.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #381. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nMarlo was stabbed to death by Jackie Shorr, a deranged woman who claimed to be Rick's biological mother.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #398</ref> Rick eventually revived Marlo using the technology of the Hulk villain known as [[Leader (comics)|Leader]].<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #400</ref> She did not come back all the way at first, and spent some time in a near vegetative state, only snapping out of it and regaining some form of consciousness when her brothers tried to issue a court order to take her into care.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #406</ref>\n\nRick and Marlo married, although the wedding was nearly called off. At his [[bachelor party]], Rick discovered a [[soft porn]] film that featured Marlo stripping [[nudity|nude]] at the [[beach]], which was one of several such films she appeared in just after she had finished high school,<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #417</ref> but the couple reconciled thanks to the Hulk's intervention. Every supervillain from [[Kree]] to [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]] appeared at their wedding, due to the machinations of the [[Impossible Man]].<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #418</ref> The two even became famous while hosting a successful [[talk show]] called ''Keeping up with the Joneses''. During this time, they made occasional appearances in the Hulk series; Marlo and [[Betty Banner]] (wife of Bruce Banner) became close friends and lived together (again) for a while until Betty's untimely death.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #467</ref>\n\nMarlo and Rick separated for a time, and she occupied herself with running the couple's [[Los Angeles]]-area comic book store.{{issue|date=September 2011}} She and Rick reunited shortly after he was bonded with [[Genis-Vell]] the son of the original Captain Marvel, who took on that mantle himself.{{issue|date=September 2011}} Soon after, Marlo was menaced by the [[Wendigo (comics)|Wendigo]], a cannibalistic monster. She was saved by the Hulk.{{issue|date=September 2011}} During the ''Captain Marvel'' series, Marlo became possessed by [[Death (Marvel Comics)|the personification of Death]]. The large amount of cosmic powers leave her with a literal death wish, which manifests itself as reality changing to suit Marlo's desires.{{issue|date=September 2011}} Later, after coming to understand the situation, this talent goes away when she wishes for it to be gone.{{issue|date=September 2011}}  The comic store itself often had stories featuring real-life incidents happening to Marlo and Rick. Marlo spent much of the time annoyed by a chain-smoking, female ghost only she could see and hear.{{issue|date=September 2011}} This was the spirit of the girl killed during the Wendigo debacle. Marlo played a major role in the ''Captain Marvel'' series.\n\nAt one point she develops an attraction for the superheroine [[Moondragon]] which surprises the pair. At first both were unsure of what to do and before they could explore the possibility Marlo is whisked away by her husband.{{issue|date=September 2011}}  When the truth eventually comes out Rick stands aside to let Marlo and Heather figure out what may be.  After some time passes Marlo and Heather break up when Marlo realizes that whatever feelings she had, they were stronger towards Rick. Heather, brokenheartedly, states she must have subconsciously used her telepathy to enamor Marlo. This is not true, just Heather trying to make the split easier for Marlo.{{issue|date=September 2011}}\n\nAs the ''Captain Marvel'' series ended, Rick, now separated from Captain Marvel, and Marlo were last seen happily in love and giving their marriage a second chance.{{issue|date=September 2011}}\n\nMarlo went missing for some time and was revealed to have been kidnapped by the Leader. She was turned into a new version of the Harpy by the Leader. After telepathically manipulating her, the Leader sent her to battle Bruce Banner and [[Skaar (character)|Skaar]]. Afterwards when she recognized Rick upon regressing back from his A-Bomb form, she returned to normal and reunited with Rick.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #604</ref>\n\nDuring the ''[[World War Hulks]]'' storyline, she as Harpy helps A-Bomb fight [[Ulik]] after averting a disaster on the train tracks he destroyed. When Ulik starts to choke Marlo, she is saved by A-Bomb who defeats Ulik.<ref>''World War Hulks'' #1</ref>\n\nDuring the ''[[Chaos War (comics)|Chaos War]]'' storyline, [[Doctor Strange]] reveals to the Hulk and his allies that Marlo is now a crucial factor in the war. Due to her time as a host of Death, Marlo could serve as a \"Death substitute\" if she is discovered which would result in everyone currently merely immobilized by Hell being killed by the hellfire.<ref>''The Incredible Hulks'' #618</ref> Marlo soon uses her connection to Death to bring Doc Samson, [[Jarella]], [[Hiroim]], and Rebecca Banner back from the dead to help the Hulks in their fight against a resurrected [[Abomination (comics)|Abomination]], a [[Zom]]-possessed Doctor Strange, and the forces of [[Amatsu-Mikaboshi (comics)|Amatsu-Mikaboshi]].<ref>''The Incredible Hulks'' #619</ref> Marlo Chandler later uses her connection to Death to free Doctor Strange from Zom and send Abomination back to the afterlife.<ref>''The Incredible Hulks'' #620</ref>\n\nMarlo apparently reappears in Las Vegas some years later.<ref>''Ben Reilly: The Scarlet Spider'' #6</ref> to talk with [[Ben Reilly]], the clone of [[Spider-Man]], recently brought back to life and having spent time acting as the new [[Jackal (comics)|Jackal]], but it is soon revealed that this is actually Death, using Marlo's body to talk with Reilly due to their prior bond.<ref>''Ben Reilly: The Scarlet Spider'' #7</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nMarlo Chandler is an expert gymnast and swimmer.{{Issue|date=January 2011}}\n\nFor a time, Marlo possessed a \"death wish\" power after her time serving as host to the cosmic being known as Death, which resulted in her being able to unconsciously shape reality when she made wishes, although this power would only work if she was not consciously trying to use it. She eventually erased this power after she wished that she no longer had it. It has been revealed the connection with Death can be rekindled under extreme circumstances, allowing her to access the powers of the cosmic being Mistress Death herself.\n\nAs the new [[Harpy]], Marlo had superhuman strength and durability as well as the ability to fly and fire energy bolts from her hands.{{Issue|date=January 2011}}\n\n==Other versions==\nThe [[Ultimate Universe]] version of Marlo Chandler made a brief appearance as the hostess at a Kansas diner that was visited by the Hulk and [[Power Princess]].<ref>''Ultimate Hulk'' Annual #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nIn ''[[Ruins (comics)|Ruins]]'' Marlo Chandler appears as a morphine addict living with Rick Jones who has gotten cancer from the gamma blast.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://marvel.com/universe/Jones,_Marlo_Chandler Marlo Chandler] at Marvel.com\n* [http://marvel.wikia.com/Marlo_Chandler_%28Earth-616%29 Marlo Chandler] at Marvel Wiki\n* [http://www.comicvine.com/marlo-jones/4005-10860/ Marlo Chandler] at Comic Vine\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20051120071715/http://www.incrediblehulk.com/marlo.html Incredible Hulk.com Profile]\n\n{{Hulk}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Chandler, Marlo}}\n[[Category:Characters created by Peter David]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1988]]\n[[Category:Fictional avatars]]\n[[Category:Fictional bisexual females]]\n[[Category:Fictional gymnasts]]\n[[Category:Fictional harpies]]\n[[Category:Fictional pornographic film actors]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters who are shapeshifters]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics LGBT characters]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics female characters]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics mutates]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters with superhuman strength]]"}]}}}}
