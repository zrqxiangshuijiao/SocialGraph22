DeCarlo's 10-year run on the series, from #18\u201393 (June 1949 \u2013 Nov. 1959), was succeeded by the team of writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Stan Goldberg]], a.k.a. \"Stan G.\", the main Atlas/Marvel colorist at the time.

Fellow humor-comic stars [[Hellcat (comics)|Patsy Walker]] and Hedy Wolfe, among the sidewalk crowd outside, talk about wanting to catch a glimpse of celebrity Millie, whom they've heard is on the guest list. [[Alex Ross]] depicted her at the ceremony when he revisited the wedding in the 1990s miniseries ''[[Marvels]]''.\n\nShe reappeared in the 1980s as an older character running her own modeling agency and minding her niece, the titular star of writer-artist [[Trina Robbins]]' ''Misty'' (Dec. 1985 \u2013 May 1986), from Marvel's children's-oriented [[Star Comics]] imprint.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Markstein |first1=Don |website=Don Markstein's Toonopedia |access-date=2 April 2020  |url=http://www.toonopedia.com/misty.htm |title=Misty}}</ref> Millie has also appeared in the superhero comics ''[[Defenders (comics)|The Defenders]]'' #65 (Nov. 1978); ''[[Dazzler (Marvel Comics)|Dazzler]]'' #34 (Oct. 1985); ''[[She-Hulk|The Sensational She-Hulk]]'' #60 (Feb. 1994); and in the [[kitsch]]y [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] series ''The Age of the Sentry'' #3 (Jan. 2009).\n\nMillie starred alongside [[Patsy Walker]] and [[Mary Jane Watson]] in a 23-page story \"Un-enchanted Evening\", by writer [[Paul Tobin (writer)|Paul Tobin]] and artist [[Colleen Coover]], in ''King-Size Spider-Man Summer Special'' #1 (Oct. 2008). Millie stars in the four-issue [[miniseries]] ''Models, Inc.'' (Oct. 2009 \u2013 Jan. 2010).\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nAspiring model Millie Collins of Sleepy Gap, Kansas, moves to New York. She meets photographer Clicker (originally Flicker) Holbrook who arranges an introduction at the Hanover Modelling Agency. She is hired as a model by the agency. At the start of the series her best friend was regular character [[Toni Turner]]; later on Toni became a recurring character, and her role as best friend and confidant was Daisy, the agency's wardrobe assistant. She becomes romantically involved with Clicker Holbrook. At one point, she shares an apartment on the [[East Side (Manhattan)|East Side]] of [[Manhattan]] with Toni Turner. Near the end of the series, Millie and Daisy shared an apartment.\n\nThroughout the series, redheaded model [[Chili Storm]] was Millie's friendly nemesis (Millie: \"Sorry I'm late! I just got back from the salon!\"  Chili: \"Too bad they didn't have time to take you!\" Millie [ringing phone drawn in foreground]: \"Oh, there's the phone\". Chili: \"Wow!  I'll bet you can also identify doorbells and auto horns!\"). When Millie wasn't around, however, Chili would sometimes speak up for her colleague. Chili starred in her own 1969\u20131973 spin-off series.<ref>[https://www.comics.org/series/1908/ ''Chili''] at the Grand Comics Database</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Brevoort |first1=Tom |last2=DeFalco |first2=Tom |last3=Manning |first3=Matthew K. |last4=Sanderson |first4=Peter |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |title=Marvel Year By Year: A Visual History |date=2017 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1465455505 |page=136}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to regular appearances by Millie, Chili, Clicker and Daisy, there were occasional appearances by Howard Hanover, Toni Turner, Marvin, Agnes Ames (in charge of Wardrobe at the modeling agency) and a colleague who helped with agency sets and maintenance, Chili's wealthy boyfriend Reginald Goldmine, and Miss Scrubbley. Very late in the series, Mr. Hanover had a daffy platinum-blonde assistant, Dolly. Millie's parents are Nancy and Henry Collins. She has one younger brother, Henry Collins Jr.\n\n==Reception==\n\n=== Critical reception ===\nIn 1968, ''Millie the Model'' won an [[Alley Award]] for \"Best Romance Comic\" at the [[Comic Art Convention|New York Comic Art Convention]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=1968 Alley Awards |url=http://www.hahnlibrary.net/comics/awards/alley68.php |access-date=2022-08-30 |website=www.hahnlibrary.net}}</ref>\n\nJerry Stanford of ''[[CBR.com]]'' stated, \"This is probably the best known of all comics Marvel published outside of the super-hero genre.
