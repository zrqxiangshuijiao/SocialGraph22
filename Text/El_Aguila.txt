El \u00c1guila is patterned after the literary hero [[Zorro]].<ref name=\"back45\">{{cite journal|last= Callahan|first= Timothy|date= December 2010|title= Power Man and Iron Fist|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue= #45|pages= 3\u201311|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}</ref> His name is [[Spanish language|Spanish]] for \"the [[eagle]]\".\n\nThe character made its live-action debut in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] television series ''[[She-Hulk: Attorney at Law]]'', played by Joseph Castillo-Midyett.\n\n==Publication history==\nEl \u00c1guila was introduced as a recurring adversary of [[Luke Cage|Power Man]] and [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]]. ''[[Power Man and Iron Fist]]'' writer [[Jo Duffy|Mary Jo Duffy]] recounted his creation: {{quote|El \u00c1guila was designed by [[Dave Cockrum]] and he had this big [[Zorro]] thing, and Zorro was another one of these characters that I was just crazy about and Power Man and Iron Fist was tricky. These were not guys who could fly. Their superpowers were defensive and if they were offensive, it was going to be hands-on, and it's remarkably tricky inventing a [[villain]] for somebody like that ... It seemed to me that someone like Zorro but with one or two powers would be about the right level and since Iron Fist was a little bit easygoing and unworldly, and Power Man was just so cranky and completely grounded in the here and now, giving him somebody with this playful panache would be frustrating. Iron Fist wouldn\u2019t even get it, Power Man would be infuriated by it, and it would give El \u00c1guila a certain amount of charm. So I wasn\u2019t just thinking of the power problem, though it was a problem, but in terms of the characters\u2014it had to interest me. And Power Man and Iron Fist were so well-realized as characters that if a villain wasn\u2019t as equally well-realized, then what was the point in doing it?<ref name=\"back45\"/>}}\n\nEl \u00c1guila made his first appearance in ''Power Man and Iron Fist'' #58 (August [[1979 in comics|1979]]).<ref>[http://www.marveldirectory.com/individuals/a/aguila.htm El Aguila] (marveldirectory.com)</ref> The character made several subsequent appearances in the title, including issues #58 (Aug. 1979), 65 (October 1980), 78 (February 1982), and 99-100 (February\u2013March 1982). He appeared in ''[[Marvel Super Hero Contest of Champions]]'' #1-3 (June\u2013August 1982) and ''[[Marvel Fanfare]]'' #3 (July 1982), and after an appearance in ''[[Marvel Comics Presents]]'' #9 (December 1988) a few years later he was not seen for some time. He finally made a return with a cameo appearance in ''[[Great Lakes Avengers|G.L.A.]]'' #2 (July 2005), as well as ''Marvel Westerns: Outlaw Files'' (2006) and ''[[The New Avengers (comics)|The New Avengers]]'' #18 (June 2006).\n\nEl \u00c1guila received an entry in the original ''The [[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe]]'' #1, in The ''Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Deluxe Edition'' #1, and in the ''Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Master Edition'' #12.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nAlejandro Montoya was born in [[Madrid]], [[Spain]], and later moved to America. Upon discovering his [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] powers, Alejandro decided to use his unique abilities as a swashbuckler and costumed crime fighter, taking up the mantle of El \u00c1guila (Spanish for \"The Eagle\"), an identity passed down by his ancestors. As El \u00c1guila, he preys upon drug dealers and criminals that take advantage of the poor and needy.  He is not a certified law authority and is wanted by authorities. Soon after launching his crime-fighting campaign against drug dealers, slumlords, brutal police, and other wrongdoers, \u00c1guila encountered [[Iron Fist (character)|Iron Fist]], [[Luke Cage|Power Man]], and [[Misty Knight]].<ref>{{cite comic|writer = [[Jo Duffy|Duffy, Mary Jo]]|penciller=  [[Trevor Von Eeden|Von Eeden, Trevor]]|inker= [[Dan Green (artist)|Green, Dan]]|story = El Aguila Has Landed|title = [[Power Man and Iron Fist]]|issue= #58|date = Aug. 1979}}</ref>\n\n\u00c1guila aided Power Man and Iron Fist against female assassins out to kill Jeryn Hogarth.<ref>{{cite comic| writer = Duffy, Mary Jo|penciller= [[Kerry Gammill|Gammill, Kerry]]|inker= Villamonte, Ricardo| story= An Eagle in the Aerie|title= Power Man and Iron Fist|issue= #65|date = Oct. 1980}}</ref> He also battled [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Hawkeye]] while investigating [[Cross Technological Enterprises]] when Hawkeye was serving as their head of security.<ref>{{cite comic|writer= Boatner, Charlie| penciller= Von Eeden, Trevor|inker = [[Josef Rubinstein|Rubinstein, Josef]]|story= Swashbucklers | title= [[Marvel Fanfare]]|issue= #3|date = July 1982}}</ref>\n\n\u00c1guila teamed up with Power Man and Iron Fist to capture the [[Sabretooth (comics)|Slasher]], and fought the [[Constrictor (comics)|Constrictor]].<ref name=\"PMIF99\">{{cite comic|writer= Duffy, Mary Jo|penciller= Gammill, Kerry|inker= Villamonte, Ricardo|story= Slasher|title= Power Man and Iron Fist|issue= #99|date = Feb. 1982}}</ref> Alongside [[Colleen Wing]] and Misty Knight, he battled mercenaries working for Ward Meachum and fought Fera.<ref name=\"PMIF99\" />\n\nHe aided Power Man, Iron Fist, Colleen Wing, [[Bob Diamond (comics)|Bob Diamond]], and [[Rafael Scarfe]] in an attempt to rescue Misty Knight and [[D.W.
